that exactly how long the movie felt to me there weren even nine laughs in nine months it terrible mess of movie starring terrible mess of man mr hugh grant huge dork it not the whole oral sex prostitution thing referring to grant not me that bugs me it the fact that grant is annoying not just adam sandler annoying we re talking jim carrey annoying since when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting but on the other hand since when do really bad slapstick fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant head in joan cusack lap scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie and obscene double entendres robin williams the obstetrician tells grant pregnant girlfriend she has big pussy referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat but nonetheless grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie pass for comedy nine months is predictable cookie cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot hugh grant plays successful child psychiatrist why child psychologist so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange kid my dad an asshole grant flutters eyelashes offers nervous smile then responds in his annoying english accent and think actually have talent attitude could you possibly elaborate on that kid my dad _huge_ asshole more like hugh asshole but that beside the point which is nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief so anyway grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction fluttered eyelashes nervous smiles this paves the way for every possible pregnancy child birth gag in the book especially since grant equally annoying friend wife is also pregnant the annoying friend is played by tom arnold who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick none of which is funny such as scene where arnold beats up costumed arnie the dinosaur you draw your own parallels on that one in toy store the only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway as an artist with fear of and simultaneous longing for commitment not even robin williams who plays russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics has much humor his is one joke character the old foreign guy who mispronounces english stereotype did someone say yakov smirnov that my favorite vodka by the way hence the line now it time to take look at your volvo another nasty but unamusing joke except this one goes right over the ten year olds heads while the adults simultaneously groan nine months is complete failure low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud unfunny slapstick failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy hugh grant sunset boulevard arrest please no caught with his pants down jokes may bring more people into the theaters but they certainly won leave with smile on their faces not after 90 minutes of grant nervous smiles everything in the movie is so forced so unauthentic that anyone with an over 80 sorry hugh will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire but at least they didn spend 60 bucks for it
knock off is exactly that cheap knock off of an action movie it also the worst movie have seen thus far this year figured it would be at least couple of months before saw the worst film of 1998 but alas it has already been found jean claude van damme stars as think designer jeans executive who discovers his half brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods rob schneider plays van damme partner and rochon plays actually have no idea who rochon was supposed to be she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there many things are not explained in this film but do know that for some bizarre reason van damme seemed to be doing jackie chan impression throughout the flick where chan comes off as endearing in his normal guy character seen in many of his films van damme just comes off as wimp we re never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions to be more clear did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie and even then it was not made too clear the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong tsui hark who directed van damme last movie the bad but not nearly as bad as this double team never lets the camera rest for second and that no exaggeration we are even treated to five second shot from the point of view of van damme foot entering shoe fabulous seriously though have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions as long as they don get carried away for example look at sam raimi army of darkness one of his best movies features some of the most inventive camera work have ever seen but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story that concept that tsui can seem to grasp the special effects and outrageous camera angles rule knock off to the point where the audience doesn have clue as to what happening any more another problem with the film is that it looks cheap the film stock used is of such low caliber that thought was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night and for some inexplicable reason everyone voice seems to have been dubbed even the stars and even the special effects seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about are inconsistent for example there is scene in which van damme drives car out of window the car slams into the ground and the left wheel is completely destroyed seconds later the car drives off at full speed hey have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie but line must be drawn somewhere finally the acting nobody gives good performance in this film van damme an actor usually like is way off the mark playing everyman and schneider here to provide comic relief assume is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene even the usually solid paul sorvino gives terribly over the top performance as once again have no idea who he was supposed to be in case haven yet made it clear enough knock off is the worst movie of van damme career and possibly the worst movie of the decade and it not even one of those movies that so bad it funny it too inept to be funny there are no redeeming factors in knock off and seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased
traffic violation dr daniel review of turn dr rating critical condition okay here the deal ll be the first one to grant that everybody needs day off now and then ll even go so far as to say that vacation is necessary part of doing any job well mean hey ve been known to stretch weekend into three day outing if friday looks to be slow day and if monday ain looking like pick me up well ve been known to give martha nell call and say do me favor sweetheart bump old man ferguson boil lancing to tuesday morning and tell miss audrey that ll swing by her house monday evening and see if we can get her trick knee back in line simple sentence like that and ve got nice four day fishing trip with the boys or more often than not trip up to cherokee for jackpot bingo and assorted other mountain funnery but the point is if you take day off do something different if you ve worked yourself silly for months relax bit sleep in eat pancakes at noon microwave an egg in its shell watch pro wrestling with the sound off listen to some barry beyaz records at high speed whatever but do not under any circumstances spend your vacation doing the same thing you do for living and if you do don make the final product look ten times worse than it would any other time because do not want to hear your sob stories oliver stone you apparently thought you needed break from making important films cool so you found this hinky little book and decided to make it movie that cool too but ollie old sage do not take good story and hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade just eager to meet you one day so can buy you stoli look you in the eye and say what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with turn and ll stand there staring til get straight answer sean penn stars turn as bobby drifter who had some troubles while back he heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows radiator hose stranding him in superior arizona held there by an ignorant inbred turtleneck hick of mechanic named darrell while darrell puts new hose on the ride bobby walks into town to see what cooking is it needless of me to say that superior arizona is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely probably not bobby meets up with grace jennifer lopez who invites him back to her place for drape hanging and other domestic issues just as those issues are starting up grace husband jake storms in looking like check out day of the elks lodge convention just beats bobby silly bobby takes to the road only to meet up with jake again and jake asks bobby to kill grace little while later grace asks bobby to kill jake them murderous arizonians gotta love em if any of this sounds familiar congratulations you win kewpie doll the story is straight shoplift of kirmizi rock west cult favorite few years back from john dahl maker of the phenomenal the last seduction but the contest doesn end there guys and gals we get steals from russ meyer movies where everybody in town is horny and sweaty we get the town from bad day at siyah rock minus the train plus busty women who can speak look at any schwarzenegger film and you ll see our hero bobby as bobby has mudhole stomped in his keister dozen times has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times gets bit by tarantula gets shot at and ends up with vultures circling overhead all the while getting up like he just got shaving nick bobby as terminator stretch it bit and we have five finger discount from doc hollywood where the whole story occurs because of car trouble forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic okay he working from book so maybe ollie not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas just expect man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft few original ideas before exposing the negative just wish he hadn brought cast like this together for what amounts to group toe stub sean penn gives great performance and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be playing over the top caricatures of stereotype characters the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blankety blank is going on too bad it not fun to watch when it happening to us while we sit through this mess of film turn is not bad film if you re fan of technique it the oliver stone you ve always known robert richardson is his usual cinematographer and rob and ollie know how to shoot flick great camera angles shifting viewpoints wicked colors nice looking pictures but pictures of what think rather stare at xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt whirl point of this loser film plot twists are one thing repetition is almost unforgivable and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie ve seen in the past five years oliver know your body of work is nothing to sniff at you ve been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie and films like platoon jfk wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on your scripts are certainly respectable your budgets are up there on the screen and your actors don dog it and know that maybe with turn you were just kicking back just having fun that fine but don do that with movie with the potential of this one do some police academy sequel imagine that do big comedy like remake of it mad mad mad mad world but do not drop limp turn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as an oliver stone movie and not question why it stinks like week old snook there right way to have fun and wrong way to have fun this was as wrong as you can get without going to jail
there will be another the ads for this sequel proclaimed and why not true brandon lee is dead but there would be no reason for him to appear in followup to 1994 the crow anyway the idea of spinning artist james barr original comic book series into sequel franchise revolves around the notion that different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie taking its own righteous vengeance against the world given that basic framework the story could move in any number of directions of course it doesn stubbornly the crow city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film when lee eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death remember the first film primarily as harrowing exercise in brutality in flashback we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover and then we watch in real time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind it loud and repetitive true sadist delight but it also horrifying and fascinating city of angels gives us more of the same but less skillfully there an audience guaranteed for film like this although bad reviews and poor word of mouth will likely ensure that it won be much of success in fact miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings ve never understood the reasoning behind this tactic since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup this time ashe french accented actor vincent perez is retrieved from his watery death he and his young son were shackled together shot and then thrown off pier by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead perez might have some screen presence if he given something to do with himself but here he simply thrown in front of the camera as pretty face at first he shivery and frightened but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes badass biker from beyond the grave he befriended by sarah mia kirshner presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film kirshner so beguiling in exotica is here an exquisitely photographed blank tattooed with angels wings sarah is just about as lovely as women come but she serves no purpose not even as seductress the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah richard brooks but far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop who plays gaunt fellow named curve iggy all bones veins and drawl is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film like all good things here he dispatched too soon and without much imagination in the meantime we re subjected to tedious glimpses of judah compound where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren distinctly secondhand even the soundtrack is tired more than anything ve seen from hollywood lately city of angels smacks baldly of product it movie with lousy script but great look critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope but his work isn that bad per se he got good eye and some intriguing visual ideas if anything this movie has few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery his major stylistic failing is that he can seem to direct an action scene and the quick nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of low budget kung fu movie but as director he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn the performers who couldn and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved who bought david goyer anemic script anyway the producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be hollow rehash or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference
ahh yes the teenage romance an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies and in the end the guy always gets the girl and with the arrival of the breakout hit `she all that last year followed by long catalogue of imitators including `10 things hate about you and `drive me crazy the genre previously on life support is once again hot commodity along now comes `down to you the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she all that craze with their latest project which has the studdly freddie prinze jr attached and all only `down to you doesn have the unlikely scenario mentioned above it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance dull unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we re accustomed to this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12 year old girls will find convincing in strictly textbook fashion college sophomore and aspiring chef al prinze jr meets freshman artist imogen julia stiles they hit it off like couple can only in the movies from here it the standard boy meets girl boy loses girl boy drinks entire bottle of shampoo and may or may not get girl back story the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters who are frequently taking part in activities that well only happen in the movies fortunately the cast of `down to you has certain appeal freddie prinze jr and julia stiles are an adorable couple and when on screen together they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around zak orth as the newly realized porn star monk shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film intelligent dialogue rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy `the faculty selma blair `cruel intentions and ashton kutcher tv `that 70 shows even the fonz himself henry winkler the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia has welcome role as al dad the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray maybe the concept of `down to you looked good on paper to draw such crowd as feature film however the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely perhaps worst of all `down to you is not funny the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired the characters on screen often laughing at each other goofy embarrassing antics seemed far more amused than the audience even the giggly 12 year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it course the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr in fantasy sequence called `cooks `cops take off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook decent meal for needy families with the assistance of fully armed swat team of course when this is the highlight reel you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired in order to make teen comedy work you ve got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity `10 things hate about you actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards and the result was refreshing no such luck with `down to you it just textbook romance where despite absurd circumstances everything is bound to work out in the end and at the end of the whole clich ordeal the nicest thing you could possibly say would be only in the movies
before the remake of psycho appears we ve got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film dial for murder as usual hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars and it all amounts to loud sounding nothing the film opens with emily paltrow and david viggo mortensen having fun in an loft apartment the problem is paltrow is married to stephen douglas who is not too happy when he discovers this affair if was paltrow though definitely go with mortensen less wrinkles anyhow stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition he ll pay him to kill his lovely wife mortensen agrees but the murder goes awry and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses unfortunately the film dosen progress very fast in fact it moves like tortoise with arthritis read very very the plot moves nowhere fast and only becomes exciting in very short bursts not too good for thriller also the performances apart from douglas are below par paltrow showing immense talent in se7en 1995 and sliding doors 1997 is strangely stilted even unconvincing in this movie mortensen is little bit better coming across as younger douglas but his role isn meaty enough to show all his talent which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film which is does however doubt douglas finds it very hard to play stogie smoking drinking womanizer with creepy underside also popping up in the film is david suchet playing shifty looking detective again it not character we re seeing on the screen it david suchet the director who bought us the fugitive piles on all the flash techniques such as zoom in quick cuts etc the lighting is also interesting however looks can save this film from the depths of mediocre and the film seemed to work better in single set anyway the screenplay is but there some hackneyed sub plot about douglas being ruthless player on wall street again and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched the characters also make incredibly dumb moves especially paltrow and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel with combination of no tension drama or decent characters perfect murder is failure all round and an incredible disappointment there are few bright moments but they are far and few between the last thing thriller should be is boring and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas you wouldn be missing anything if you decided not to watch perfect murder overall rating= review by david wilcock 1998 you know for kids norville barnes
coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers relentless 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz played by character actor leo rossi spawned three more sequels relentless third in the row features sam dietz again but this time detective who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case doesn want to deal with similar line of work divorced demoralised and transferred he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes hunting ground for another serial killer and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz old cases to make things even more interesting it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation fans of the british tv films and mini series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see lot of similarities relentless series of movies they both feature vicious psychopathic killers yet also give lot of usually depressive details about chief investigator private lives this one isn an exception but similarities with british television are only in content the execution and style is different which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best useless gratuitous erotica also doesn help either obviously making this film longer than it should be the actors are good though leo rossi is fine as usual and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career signy coleman as dietz love interest is on the other hand quite miscast but she won have to worry about it in the future career since relentless wasn supposed to be anybody finest moment anyway
this is not simple plan about finding plane load of money and getting away with the cash this is more about parable of greed and how money can become the bane of your life yes there are elements of fargo here the snow and cold although not as vivid in the blood and gore department it shows how greed can set of chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives and how at the end of the day the things that matter most are love truth and honesty although in one sense it may seem tedious making movie about the ugliness of greed not box office material it does become tedious not because of the morale ending but because one expects the movie to end that way this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there the characters in this drama are mixture of simple and intellectual folk brothers and friends who all fall prey to the avarice of money they should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful bill paxton also gives powerful performance as the greedier younger brother whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife who indirectly causes the most problems fill room full of greedy people and several million dollars and you will end up with simple recipe for blood bath it not simple plan when you shoot everyone you love for money unless you re the menendez brothers
one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton 1925 silent film seven chances now ve never seen seven chances as more of chaplin fan than keaton fan but seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this donnell plays jimmie shannon the manager of pool table manufacturing company he also fears commitment and despite dating anne renee zellweger for over three years he unwilling to marry her his reasons well he guy you see and well guys are like stallions and they apparently don like to be roped or something hey that the movie explanation marry renee zellweger in second eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose and when he does it the most absurd proposal ever uttered by man ever he essentially says to her you win and hands her ring the audience should now hate this character did then the meat of the plot presents itself jimmie grandfather peter ustinov completely wasted dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business however in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers jimmie must be married before his next birthday which is just over 24 hours away having blown his chances with anne jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest business proposition the movie wasn half bad by this time surprisingly it wasn boring me and even managed to read my thoughts at one point ustinov character left video will and while he reading the ridiculous clause in it thought to myself what is this brewster millions as soon as thought it hal holbrook character actually says what is this brewster millions it was quite surreal something happens though during the film final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive up to that point all of jimmie prior girlfriends had turned down his business proposition which felt was good at least the film wasn painting women to be cold hearted altin diggers when jimmie has no other options his goofy friend played by artie lange making career out of playing the goofy friend places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes front page story at this point 100 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride these women arrive at jimmie location and immediately start bullying him about what he looking for in woman when he had enough of their unjustified attacks he tells the angry mob that there been mistake and he won be marrying any of them as result the women proceed to chase him around the city in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off this goes on for the rest of the film it just chris donnell running from 100 000 obnoxious greedy angry and stupid women my groans of disgust could be heard for miles the film finally ended thankfully but to this day still groaning the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 85 cast and crew info and special dvd rom features the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc which contains scenes not in the film apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing donnell around the city and at one point donnell is leaping from the tops of buses so that was bad enough to be cut but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ugh

plot separated glamorous hollywood couple must pretend to reunite for press junket of the last movie that they ever shot together kewl now only wish that could pretend never to have seen this movie critique trite unfunny boring and waste of everyone talent how premise with such zest and bite can turn into movie that doesn feature any chemistry any real laughs any surprises or any spice is beyond me how julia roberts is used solely as puppy dog character puttering around in the background while we endure the complete bitchiness of zeta jones character who is not one bit funny or romantic two ideal ingredients in romantic comedy is also beyond me and why they chose john cusack great quirky actor in his own right to play the most bland uninteresting and unfetching character with zero chemistry with either of his leads is further more beyond me and to anybody who decided that this project was funny enough to greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above along with billy crystal christopher walker seth green and stanley tucci well what can say just don have the words so is this the worst movie that ve seen all year no but it definitely sucks and it basically because well it just not funny and for the record allow me to state few more problems with it it starts off slow it got no energy it doesn engage you with any of its characters julia barely gets somewhat interesting in the film everyone else lame it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward it utterly predictable standard routine see through and uninteresting as plot and it just sits there on the screen big and ugly waiting waiting for you to laugh or find something in it that is amusing and then hank azaria shows up aaaaaah the film savior mind you some might be offended by his exaggeration of stereotype but that another story altogether but when an experienced voice actor upstages all of the main stars in summer blockbuster romantic comedy with an over the top antonio banderas accent damn dude your film in trouble rent this movie on video just to see what went wrong yourself the references to ricky ricardo and senor wences huh the idio plot points like when one of the characters goes on the roof to stretch his arms out and relax but everyone believes that he going to kill himself hardy har har and the cheap way of getting the audience to leave the theater laughing by bringing back ball sniffing dog that has no place being in the location at the end of the movie well could go on but won because do still respect all of the actors in this film and actually did laugh at azaria green and tucci antics from time to time ironic eh what about the leads dammit and liked the premise behind the film before saw the finished product of course dud all the way around btw all the talk about this film was that julia roberts was to be in fat suit for one scene her character is supposed to have lost 60 pounds so when the scene finally came did get little excited about what it might look like and then well it basically just looked like julia roberts in fat suit ugh think gonna start drinking again after this lame ass movie mon hollywood enough with the crud where joblo coming from beautiful 10 my best friend wedding 10 notting hill 10 pretty woman 10 runaway bride 10 someone like you 10 wedding planner 10 when harry met sally 10 10 you ve got mail 10
when originally saw the trailer for analyze this few months ago must admit thought it looked kind of lame and then when the commercials started popping up week or two ago thought it looked outright bad but then when analyze this finally opened few days ago an odd thing happened it got great reviews critics were proclaiming it hilarious and dead on parody of mob movies well with praise like that figured it must be good and so headed off to the theater you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts well turns out that expression is more valid than ever gave it credit for analyze this is slow unfunny and badly acted don get me wrong think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century but he is just out of his league here think the problem is he didn quite know how to approach this material he plays his character mob boss paull vitti somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama if he had played the character straight along the lines of leslie nielson in the naked gun series he probably would have been lot more successful as it is though he plays the character completely serious at some moments and for laughs at others this doesn work it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold you always know it him and the movie is badly paced too it never takes off it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum think the blame for this should be placed on the script it obvious the writer had good idea for movie mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of psychiatrist but once this is established the movie doesn really go anywhere the formula of the film seems to be this billy crystal says no to deniro deniro forces him and much wackiness ensues this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie ve said it before and ll say it again the only thing that matters to me in comedy is whether or not it funny if analyze this had been funny the pacing and bad acting wouldn have bothered me would have been too busy laughing to notice but as it is only chuckled few times the only really funny scene is dead on parody of the godfather sadly though don think anyone in the audience saw it with realized it was parody because was the only one laughing but my sense of humour have come to realize is vastly different from the general population loathed there something about mary yet loved baseketball now if you want movie that think is funny go out and see office space it full of genuine laughs and won leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes as analyze this did
this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney live action george of the jungle tarzan and the lost city the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough legendary hero to the big screen is one of the most inept and ill timed of any tarzan adventure so far badly conceived and poorly executed tarzan and the lost city appears headed for quick trip to video store shelves have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan it not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie furthermore it even more curious that this film is rated pg which by definition rules out any sex or explicit violence and while not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story tarzan deserves slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production of course no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city since the film troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line imagine george of the jungle stripped of all intentional humor and you have fair idea of what this tarzan is like with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences the film barely registers pulse anyone in search of relatively entertaining family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book which uses the same basic elements to much better effect the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery which unfortunately includes the two lead actors the film doesn attempt to re tell the origin story the thinking is that it has been done often enough instead tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke john clayton tarzan the ape man casper van dien several days before his marriage to lady jane porter jane march he is living happily in england enjoying the benefits of being land owning noble meanwhile in central africa the dastardly nigel ravens steven waddington self proclaimed scholar and explorer believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar which he calls the cradle of civilization on the way there he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things like burning native villages to earn the wrath of the locals one shaman determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal sends mystical message to tarzan for help with lady jane following close behind he returns to the jungle where he was born its patently obvious that casper van dien one of the pretty boy heroes of starship troopers was not hired on the basis of his acting ability with his plastic facial expressions monotone voice and complete inability to make convincing animal noises his range rivals that of steven seagal his pecs however are impressive and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off jane march on the other hand has to keep her shirt on which may be first for her some six years ago march give solid performance in jean jacques annaud steamy the lover since then she made the career killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night which exploited her every acting defiency tarzan continues this trend march may be attractive but at least judging by this performance she can act meanwhile steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be really detestable bad guy instead he turns out to be little more than nuisance the story line is pure formula which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies the problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless the romantic elements are all contrived in fact lady jane presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance the special effects are truly bottom of the barrel including some laughably bad men in ape costumes apparently animatronics were too expensive for this production and of course as with all jungle movies there are the obligatory cute animals over the years the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material the most famous ape man was johnny weismuller but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part including gordon scott who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role weismuller made 12 tarzan features van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number and having seen tarzan and the lost city would argue that the movie going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12
robin williams is comedic genus that is he is one when he in film that allows him space to move flubber straps him in straitjacket covers him with duct tape stuffs him in coat closet and piles furniture against the door to make sure that he doesn get out in re make of its own 1961 absent minded professor disney offers us proof that more is definitely less recycling old films that darned cat 101 dalmatians dressed up as new is the newest money machine from the home of the mouse that roared professor phillip brainard williams is terminally forgetful scientist teaching at small college his fiancee sara jean reynolds marcia gay harden president of the college is none too happy with him because he left her waiting at the altar due to his lack of short term and long term memory she giving him one more chance he blows that chance when he invents flubber flying rubber and is so excited by his discovery that sara jean is once again awaiting him in her beyaz dress his tardiness is helped along by his jealous flying robotic assistant who wants him all to herself it not all bad news flubber is green jello that can magnify and reflect energy that is applied to it brainard realizes the commercial potential within the goo can save the school from bankruptcy and being taken over by the town evil industrialist charles hoenicker raymond barry while he busy with his new breakthrough the slighted sweetheart is being wooed by his sleazy rival wilson croft christopher mcdonald there flying car flubber enhanced basketball game and an assortment of broken lab equipment none of which are the least bit interesting or funny at one point my son looked around the audience and asked why are these people laughing although williams turns in one of his least inspired roles he is easily the most lively of the actors everyone else comes across as half asleep the re make is successful in that respect it feels like bad disney movie from the sixties remember the original as being charming but my guess is that the memory from almost four decades ago has been artificially enhanced by the years there have been some updates fred macmurray flying model has been replaced by bird his faithful dog charlie is now weebo the hovering robot the biggest change is that with sophisticated computer animation we now can have films show off special effects without being at all entertaining flubber is anthropomorphized into being supposedly with personality the gloop has little arms and legs and splits into tiny little gloopettes for big dance number this has nothing to do with the story the only possible reason is to create merchandising opportunities so that kids can badger their parents into taking them to mcdonalds for the toys not that contributing little to the plot is big problem there are very few aspects of the film that move the story and those that do don make sense the discovery of flubber is going to save the college because brainard can sell his flying car to ford anyone with half brain would be able to see that his intelligent flying automaton is worth billions it unbelievable that his lover well probably not lover after all this is disney starts dating croft after the aborted wedding there not one appealing component of this man after the professor discovers that smearing golf ball with the gunk causes it to bounce uncontrollably around his lab wreaking havoc cringed as he picked up bowling ball this guy is beyond forgetful venturing into the certifiable co writer john hughes used to direct light weight but thoughtful teen films the care behind pretty in pink and the breakfast club all went out the window after his home alone franchise heated up the box offices looking much like home alone flubber even features couple of vapid goons who get banged around and cute little boy who screams lot in some ways it difficult to judge this film have suspicion that not it target audience after all measure my age in two digits

was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night but before that stopped into my video store to rent some movies luckily my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta knew it was going to be bad print with only half faces and poor sound quality but couldn help myself got it well after watching it it indeed was bad print was glad didn dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in bad theatre watching bad movie this movie really sucks it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy for example how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail the songs are bad the acting is bad especially deepti bhatnagar and the direction is the worst of all the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up didn even finish the movie couldn take it anymore note but if anyone out there liked aatish by the same director guess you like this movie it practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff aditya panscholi is the sidekick again was going to give it zero but personally like jackie shroff so loosened up little he looked fresh wore good clothes as always and his performance even though it wasn his best was the only saving grace of the movie
goodbye lover sat on the shelf for almost year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may and one look will tell you why it mess and that way before ellen degeneres shows up the film is one of those torrid double indemnity crime stories that in this case required the services of three screenwriters suspect that one wrote sexy thriller one wrote murder mystery and one wrote comedy then director roland joff tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment didn laugh at ellen degeneres much think was supposed to degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse tough talking vulgar cop with bad wardrobe and bad hair either degeneres is wearing wig as most of the actors appear to be or she doesn yet have enough clout to secure hairstylist every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip but her incessant wisecracking is poorly written and merely stupid her reaction to the brutal killing of jogger is at least she died healthy and that one of her wittier asides degeneres sgt rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of wait to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triple crosses it best described this way sultry sexpot real estate agent sandra dunmore patricia arquette is married to jake creative yet unfocused and alcoholic advertising rep played by dermot mulroney sandra likes to act out her deep seated sexual fantasies and jake brother ben the suave as ever don johnson likes to help ben is also coming on to his petite mousy co worker peggy blaine mary louise parker and someone somewhere is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again although there are some genuine surprises the plot twists get too contrived too quickly probably around the time degeneres gumcracking gumshoe appears at least the former ellen star is going for something little different arquette turns in yet another of her stiletto heeled platinum blonde bombshell roles see lost highway true romance while quoting embarrassing lines like not wearing any underwear hope she got paid lot of money to do this here an example of some of the film flat out stupidity sandra purchases used car and disguises herself in kirmizi wig prior to stalking two of the film duplicitous lovers she drives the motorbiking couple off cliff while blaring her favorite the sound of music on her car stereo intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims so what was the point of the wig and the car the sound of music stuff might be reference to the wizard of oz allusions in david lynch wild at heart but if so joff must have forgotten that wild at heart was despicable movie it hard to believe that goodbye lover was directed by the same person who made the killing fields and the mission it not however hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long it should have stayed there
romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant with director peter medak whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays and top notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin they seemed likely to be successful combination those mentioned films however brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not solid well written screenplay call me cynical but the jobs of writer and producer don seem to mix well gary oldman plays jack grimaldi good cop turned bad selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname although the name doesn provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character jack has become addicted to feeding the hole hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money when he realizes his colleagues are being shot he feebly attempts to get out gary oldman performance is disappointingly weak he seems nearly bored in the process he also gets tangled up with mona demarkov russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone played adequately by roy scheider demarkov played by lena olin is tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator can remember seeing character quite like her after being shot handcuffed and thrown in the back seat of car she still manages to cause an accident kick out the windshield with her legs grab suitcase full of money plus some important documentation climb through the rubble land on her shot leg and still succeed at running for safety what woman lena olin performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo wife there is little insight into her character she depressed she makes obvious references she mopes around the house juliette lewis as romeo girlfriend is treated with the same cliche attitudes although ms lewis portrayal certainly didn improve it both women were anything but sexy or attractive poorly developed characters aside the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems it is so discouraging to watch film and want to shout at the main character not to do something for example jack and his friends attend funeral to hang in the background to scope out the mob scene fine jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite fine what does jack proceed to do he brushes his friends off by telling them he isn feeling well then strolls over to the boss why the boss had all ready threatened him falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack toes by the gravesite guess they weren worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral or here another demarkov set up her own death by cutting off her arm with circular saw she proceeded to set the place on fire wouldn the flames burn off the fingerprints aren dental records more important as bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be couldn she come up with better plot and it took her no time at all to get good fitting functional prosthesis lack of attention to detail certainly adds up in film this film doesn even add up the large details there is little or no consistency in the story line not much makes sense the direction lacks cohesion surprising from director whose previous credits are impeccable the moods shift the styles shift and no one can seem to decide if it is serious film or satire of one so while it certainly isn reservoir dogs it certainly isn diva there plenty more to tear apart in this film my advice to someone who hasn seen it to to wait until it comes on video there are some quotable lines that would provide campy evening if not taken seriously it not boring film just not good one or an intelligent one
after enduring mariah carey film debut glitter reminded of bit from chris rock bigger and blacker in response to women saying that they can raise child without man rock says you can drive car with your feet but that don mean it should be done to that say you can give mariah carey movie but that certainly don mean it should be done sure there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there from the beatles hard day night to the spice girls spice world but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous start off with the story which as gruesomely predictable as it is is the least offensive part of the movie the film is inexplicably set in the 80s period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for few chicks in leg warmers worse yet everyone speaking late 90s hip hop slang in what should be 1983 meant to be partially autobiographical carey plays billie frank young singer in new york who struggles to overcome rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother influential club dj julian dice lucky max beesley playing bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro hears her sing on track and decides to make her star in predictably rapid succession billie and dice fall for each other she starts hitting it big dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass and suddenly billie on the roller coaster of superstardom in the meantime billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom won give away the ending but honestly just think of unicorns and rainbows you ll figure it out the movie screams to be made with camp and that could ve been fun but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better what mistake the brief attempts at comic relief as in scene where an effeminate russian sounding director gets wacky with filming billie first music video go over like lead balloons instead the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah most dramatic scenes which brings us to the performances of which there nothing good that can be said mariah is primarily seen with wide eyed deer in the headlights look frozen on her face she actually looks scared during her one love scene but you have to wonder if the writing isn even worse so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey virginal target audience that it probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb even the characters couldn have been written more absurdly they re all members of barbie playset the important film director who swoons billie love to put you in movie making and the big time record executive who takes billie demo tape and says oh ll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning everyone in the film is device and it painful to keep watching just to see another one appear to say more would be waste there so much wrong with this film and it pains me that mariah carey with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she likely to get but then again had to suffer through her movie
for original sin the road to the screen has been rocky initially slated for release last november the film was bumped twice finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001 advance screenings of the film were denied to all but few critics generally sign that the studio realizes it has dud on its hands so is original sin really all that bad yes it is but the melodrama does offer some rewards the location settings are gorgeous and there is healthy sprinkling of t&a with angelina jolie providing the and antonio banderas the more importantly the movie is entertainingly bad veteran readers know that as rule don encourage people to patronize lousy films most of the time there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides the let go laugh at the failings of others mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable but things are different this summer quality films to put it mildly have been few and far between so as far as concerned it fair to find our kicks where we may original sin will never join such treasures as valley of the dolls road house and showgirls in the bad movie hall of fame but it ll do until something worse comes along the film adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel waltz into darkness which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film mississippi mermaid opens in turn of the century prison as jolie character slated for dawn execution tells her lurid tale to priest who appears desperately horny the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like this is not love story it is story about love wary of local gold diggers cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas banderas makes arrangements to secure mail order bride from america listing himself as mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold diggers practical man luis chooses frumpy looking lady hoping she will be loyal mate able to provide him with children imagine his surprise when his fianc julia russell jolie turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo julia explains that she sent different woman image because she didn want to be selected solely for her pretty face luis then confesses his deception leading julie to state with great significance we have something in common we are both not to trusted after their wedding luis and julia retire for glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun although the filmmakers insistence on using one of banderas legs to cover jolie crotch makes it look like he trying to climb her luis the stupidest man who ever lived immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up luis must force julia to write to her sister emily who is frantic over her lack of communication shortly after julia complains about the chirping of pet bird it is found on the floor of its cage with broken neck finally when she cleans out his accounts and disappears luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong incidentally if you re afraid giving too much away rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass along the way private detective walter downs played by thomas jane who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie 61 turns up hired by the frumpy woman sister to find out what happened to the real julia luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist having decided that if he can have her he will kill her oh the pathos of it all the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story adjusting their performances accordingly banderas is suitably impassioned while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting and with those lips she can really pout as for thomas jane he starts off acting suspicious and cagey then accelerates to snidely whiplash level of nastiness his most startling moment comes when to prove his power to humiliate he forces luis against wall verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with full on kiss if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape show them this chilling scene and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and laughable potboiler show them original sin
tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss he goes into depression and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual ghetto side of every american city there lawernce attempts to steal his car but to no avail and is dragged along with robbin on trip to arizona there they hold up store are mistaken for two other robbers just like in my cousin vinny and are chased by the police and the other robbers of course there gags along the way usually from lawernce although the film is midly funny and quite watchable there something so horribly familiar about it all this film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop and pratically the same idea as midnight run it full of all the road movie cliches and even has comedy car chase which just seemed so eighties even the credit sequence seemed to be out of steve martin or chevy chase eighties comedy there also isn much chemistry between robbins and lawernce in planes trains and automobiles there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy in nothing to lose there is hardly chemistry at all towards the end the chemistry seems to work but for the bulk of the film there is hardly any the director directs the film in workman like fashion but gets the jokes across and although there is no chemistry between the two leads they give good performances on their own lawerence gives good eddie murphy performance and robbin is alright aswell however robbin performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacob ladder and the player in fact if you want to see robbin do comedy much better than in nothing to lose suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy where he is much funnier nothing to lose does have some funny moments in it however the humour isn particulary sophisticated but if you enojyed dumb dumber you might enjoy this the characters in arizona are funny and there also good scene where robbin asks shopkeeper which threatening approach was better lawerences which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper ass and swearing lot or himselfs which was speaking in deep scary voice but the gags are predictable the lack of chemistry infurating and the ending too far fetched and perfect nothing to lose then is robbin first bad movie and hopefully his last and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film he nearly ruined carrey career with ace ventura when nature calls let hope he hasn ruined robbin or even lawerence with nothing to lose
not great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie earlier this year nora ephron wrote and produced one of the year least likeable comedies called hanging up featuring bunch of annoying women ironically lisa kudrow played one in that film as well who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves ick real sweet stuff but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer with film entitled battlefield earth seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film even if it was on cheese factor as everybody and mean everybody else pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time yipes another beauty so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with movie co starring the ever versatile lisa kudrow uhhhm you guessed it not much plot in order to escape major financial difficulties local weatherman hooks up with his ball picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery but as more and more people find out about their scheme more and more people demand part of their winnings and more and more problems arise critique simply stated didn laugh once during this entire picture for comedy it offered me few smiles bunch of nincompoops as characters miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow in what can only described as sluttier version of her character of phoebe on tv friends this film was not as disastrous as thought it would be but it was pretty close thankfully the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits dancing as the weatherman were left in the film trailer and not in this final cut and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far beautiful this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast foremost was travolta character who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie and for me the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong he didn fit the part just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role cool calculating roughneck with certain hip suave je ne sais quoi in this film he looks like he trying to be funny trying to be bad trying to be good we re not supposed to be able to notice that and when we do at least in my case consider it wrong choice in casting add that to lisa kudrow boring us with yet another one of her patented dumb blonde routines but this time dressed in sexier outfits michael rapaport stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn quite up at the same speed level as everyone else and truckload of empty comedic bullet shells and you ve got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize the only real good thing that could say about this film is that its story was actually half interesting and never really bored me also liked michael moore perverted cousin character and loved and say it again loved the character that bill pullman played give this dude his own movie he played lazy cop man who tries everything not to do any real work he fakes injuries to get off duty tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won have to fill out any forms now there base of humor sadly the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film and there not much else can say about this movie folks on the whole it was lame included slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in pool of unfunny lines and very little of interest for any target audience but get somebody to write up movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and there
first and foremost think this movie comes to grief at the hands of the pg rating it been given for those of us who haven read the james lee burke novel that heaven prisoners is based on do not rabidly go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin and eric roberts feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps gangsters with louisiana accents plots sub plots more plots and well really just want to see teri hatcher naked this is one movie you re going to worry the price of admission over hopeful still well let me share my moment of sheer panic and then the cold enervation of the big let down when semi robed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin what do you think of my butterfly butterfly asked myself what butterfly and then it hit me the scene had been snipped damn you godless pg rating show us her butterfly we want to see the goddamn butterfly so no naked teri hatcher forget about that okay now heaven prisoners is about ex alchoholic ex cop dave robicheaux alec baldwin who trying to discover life anew running bait shop and boat hire business with his loving down to earth wife annie kelly lynch everything dull but hunky dory until plane carrying illegal immigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while they re on their boat the plane nosedives into the water and sinks but from its wreckage robicheaux rescues little pixie faced salvadoran girl whom he and his wife immediately decide to adopt what they don realise is that the plane pilot was also drug dealer and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latter erstwhile colleagues when robicheaux discovers this he predictably against the advice of his wife well meaning dea agent and two gangsters who rough him up begins poking his nose where it don belong we know that the man deserves all the misery he going to get the question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the ride through tedious meandering yet utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your guide as dave robicheaux alec baldwin is fat no seriously this is not the svelte thinking man hero of the hunt for kirmizi october it is an out of shape guy who doesn look too good in roof top chasing scene he also unconvincing in the movie dramatic moments acting with what as far as can tell is steven segal like economy of expression three quarters of the way through the show while you re probably waiting for the next scene in bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to the temptation of the whiskey bottle getting drunk and beating up someone or getting beaten up you ll want to beat on him little yourself on the other hand mary stuart masterson some kind of wonderful fried green tomatoes benny joon cast as down and out stripper who has her fingers broken is quite breath of fresh air with just the right mix of cynicism warmth insecurity and humour to be the movie only endearing character eric roberts as bubba rocque always believable as the woman abusing bad guy who knows how to box see final analysis coincidentally also directed by phil joanou is believable here as the woman abusing bad guy who knows how to box and lest we forget teri hatcher role in all this this being her rather well publicised paid vacation from playing lois lane on tv adventures of lois clark she is totally ridiculous as rocque manipulative and seductive cajun wife coming across as devious as mildly disgruntled au pair who trying to get back at an employer who hasn been giving her enough days off it probably safe to say that her day job beckons and at the end of our day none of this is really worth hrs and 12 minutes of our personal misery the flying inkpot rating system wait for the video little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
it amazing how comedian can have the some of the funniest stand up around but completely fall flat in the movies take adam sandler on the basis of his first two cds they re all gonna laugh at you and what the hell happened to me he the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams but when you put him in front of camera it just isn the same kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted marginal recommendation but his latest film the waterboy is about as funny as root canal seriously willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here in fact found this movie to be more depressing than comedic the first half hour generated not one smile in me with it scenes of emotional abuse towards adam character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players but also by his very disturbed mother kathy bates what is the world coming to granted after the film gets rolling there are few mild chuckles throughout even willing to admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice but not nearly enough to sustain the waterboy for it nearly hour and half running time you re all familiar with the plot because you ve seen it at least million times before everyone picks on the hero until he shows hidden talent and leads the underdog team to victory over the champions in the process not only winning the respect of his teammates but also getting the woman he loves and believe me not giving anything away by saying that sandler team wins if you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie then god be with you the only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobby love interest mean they should be lending their talents to some loftier purpose but they do extremely well with what they are given here kudos to both of them my advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin who made very smooth and successful transition from stage to screen rely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises to make people laugh or maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have like jim carrey did with the recent truman show with the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses he just can keep going on like this
battlefield long boring and just plain stupid battlefield earth film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman in my mid teen years had horrendous re occurring nightmare behind the wheel of car was driving down straight road in the middle of desert no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway no matter what did the view didn change travelling but not getting anywhere each time awoke in sweat terrified you don have to be carl jung to understand that dream powerless to make changes trapped in boring situation with no hope of rescue this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after battlefield earth begins for all of its flash and style ron hubbard science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000 dull and stupid in the year 3000 the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 000 years humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians there no hope the future is bleak then the psychlo make mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler barry pepper who organizes revolution against chief of security terl john travolta and the alien race it an archetypal post apocalyptic plot full of promise considering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen it difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably but it does the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits are we really supposed to believe that after millennium of looking for altin the psychlo never discovered fort knox or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time and gassed up or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don notice that their slaves are missing for days travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he worth and is almost entertaining almost the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person man animal or not would ever utter some of the film _looks_ good but it also looks so familiar race of large hulking ape like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin sound like something charlton heston might be in the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from dune the final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their high tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with it too loud it too oppressive it too slow it too long far too long and on it goes the list of the problems with battlefield earth is endless it difficult to find anything in the film that does work oh yeah the color scheme is nice the real question is how this movie ever got made could it have something to do with the fact that ron hubbard was the founder of scientology and that john travolta is member of the church that might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago but it doesn give us clue as to why first time screenwriter corey mandell atrocious script was used or why the high profile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed major film or why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems the one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costner the postman which begrudgingly admit as guilty pleasure be the big budget science fiction failure battlefield earth has the honor sewed up often reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video that not the case here you can act now and make the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one don hesitate strike now while the iron is cold
the army comedy genre has never turned out truly good movie if you don count neil simon biloxi blues year after year more predictably cliched military movies come out most recently sgt bilko and none of them ever manage to be anything more than rehash of the last thought stripes would be different with ivan reitman as director bill murray as star and harold ramis as co star and co screenwriter it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army instead it was bunch of unfunny crap in the army murray about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs plays loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him so he does and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell head shaving and marching singing sequences more mind numbingly stale here than ever the characters are even less original ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette all the big name stars in stripes and even larroquette fall victim to the lame rehashed material and are never really likeable murray in particular he only gets few decent lines in although those barely funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters he was even better in caddyshack for crying out loud as with lot of the late 70 early 80 comedies stripes is completely juvenile movie only child would like but is so sex obsessed no child should be able to watch it sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition dear god every few seconds stripes isn the playful kind of sex comedy either most of the time it seems downright misogynistic as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women showers or murray lifts female onto the stove and with an know what you like look on his face says he going to give her the aunt jemima treatment which means shoving spatula under her butt repeatedly you don want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region not enjoying this the woman protests my sentiments exactly
dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson work he always finds clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain with teaching mrs tingle his directorial debut williamson has reached the end of his rope what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here the components are all there including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to but where are the thrills the laughs both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge and what shame that is loved the scream films heck even enjoyed the sci fi goofiness of the faculty kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such big draw at the box office teaching mrs tingle siyah comedy that will leave gaping void in his optimistic followers may put an end to his reign or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting script than to worry about his directing duties still have my faith but fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be forgotten echo of the past the title character of his pet project is vicious uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over the top by british actress helen mirren mrs tingle is basically every student worst nightmare heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard working of her pupils the principal michael mckean is horrified of her and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way mirren performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow siyah comedy that goes down like flat soft drink in other words it poor substitute for williamson best work the plot is big problem here material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann an over achiever hoping to get college scholarship but typical mrs tingle says her history project which she worked on for countless hours is laughable later on while studying in the gymnasium classmate barry watson offers her photo copied duplicate of mrs tingle final exam leigh ann best friend marisa coughlan encourages her to use it alas the old hag herself finds the three scheming and snatches the test and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning in the morning how convenient the three students head to mrs tingle house attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann name things get out of hand and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in tussle the plan is to tie her to bed and try to get some reasoning out of her of course not everything goes entirely to plan besides pointless sub plots involving the football coach jeffrey tambor horribly wasted there is little by way of actual progress there is no urgency to the situation little tension or laughs are involved the humor is completely inconsistent after many of the jokes the theater was so silent could have heard fly sneeze you continue to await some momentum in the story something that could possibly revive the slow pace moment like that never arises williamson also does handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players including the talented mckean and larry sanders vet tambor and the beautiful vivica fox has one lifeless scene as caring guidance counselor and then williamson disposes of her character entirely on the plus side holmes and coughlan are admirable with the latter giving frighteningly believable exorcism impression and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as substitute teacher while everything is pretty lifeless teaching mrs tingle remains watchable there are few promising ideas that pop up now and again but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching she is convincingly evil and fun to watch but even her gifted delivery can save individual scenes that flounder in boredom if there is one word for the movie surrounding her it would be `disappointing basically kevin williamson is his worst enemy here his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated not that his writing here is especially good we will see when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas whether williamson is for real
there have been bad films in recent years mr magoo was by far the worst ever made the spectacularly bad blue in the face the horrible baby genuises and now woke up early the day died it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie the film acting if that what you want to call it is well mediocre to me loaded with sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film bit boy was wrong after escaping from mental institution the thief played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty he turns to burglary to survive robs loan back kills the loan officer and runs with thousands country wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down he ends up in cemetery where he puts his money in coffin to keep it for later comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back ultimately leading to finale that is less that satisfying film which was based on long lost script by ed wood have only one question no dialogue only music and movement where exactly is the point the film moves along at rather slow pace but does have one advantage the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some it opens with fun innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that some of the low points are when the thief steals woman purse and then she faints sandra bernhard as dancer and tippi hendren as deaf woman whom the thief kills to the music of psycho come on people get some new ideas already what even worse is that the film has no plot at all well to certain extent it does but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we re bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen woke up early the day died is perfectly bad film it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make movie even with the huge cast talent the film is waste of my time and certainly waste of yours
the main problem with martin lawrence pet project thin line between love and hate like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is man is that his character is an irresponsible jerk and if that is the case it doesn seem to do anything except justify the woman actions that is especially the case in lawrence darnell wright he is one of those macho guys with women lined up mile long now don think condone this just because male my philosophy is if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on beautiful kind girl you should treat her like princess and respect her darnell doesn think like this he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target beautiful wealthy brandi web played nicely by whitfield who runs successful real estate business is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia king found myself thinking supposed to feel sorry for this guy after all it is largely darnell fault if he is lining up all these women you think he have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day as his mother says it does but he doesn so you get the sense that he not only irresponsible but also pretty dumb you especially get this sense that he dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her put my pants on in two seconds after that now brandi is psycho bitch but it hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage one final flaw though is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with brandi is classy intelligent woman with an mba from harvard who initally resists darnell immature play as she calls it as any woman like her would in real life but all of sudden she says yes but when you listen to darnell four letter word vocabulary watch his actions you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for guy like darnell period much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him lawrence can be good when he wants to but in order to prove it he needs to let other people write and direct his movies look at this movie four writers as result it too long two hours when it could ve easily worked at ninety minutes and it has lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came which makes me think the writers didn get along all of which isn necessary there are some bright spots though whitfield regina king della reese and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts and they help it out lot and there are some funny parts like for example the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property but they re just not enough to sustain the film
the great actor james woods once said and paraphrasing if sex isn messy then you re not doing it right truly profound statement and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre just replace sex with your mad slasher film for those uninformed souls the mad slasher genre or sub genre is melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of plot that follows an identical outline usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens la halloween urban legend is mad slasher flick but one that is so sanitary bloodless and nudity free that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful though not overly talented cast it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special for film makers gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in stale fright free horror movie as stephen king once said again paraphrasing if you can scare your audience gross em out if you can do that make em laugh alas urban legend succeeds only at the latter though not by intention actually find the fact that this film became minor success $40 million domestic box office gross more frightening than anything in it it seems that audiences tastes have been whittled down to such degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills but how can anyone with three digit iq argue that it provides them unfortunately these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations one idiotic super hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don need to do anything more than promise good time without the added pressure of delivering if anyone disagrees would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin wild wild west and godzilla but forget all that it goes without saying that mad slasher films or any other exploitation off shoot will be made without an ounce of craft especially considering the sheer volume that are produced allow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film the lack of enthusiastic exploitation these flicks aren harnessed with any lofty aspirations so why not break free and give your audience bloody good time sadly out of the literally hundreds made would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while and urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three despite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend setting alone offers myriad of promising possibilities it takes place on college campus which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer you see the campus is community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface all those young people are growing up together going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows so naturally some weirdness is expected all the better for that elusive crazed killer coupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around and the introduction of little exploitation into the proceedings should be relatively easy task but alas urban legend is not only idiotic and clich full it way too clean slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity little gore and much stupidity this is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than dunno exercise it the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses running like the wind prey yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques it the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud noise jump scare thing yes the audience jumps momentarily frightened but wouldn anyone if loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated quiet room lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when caught glimpse of the killer apparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers in scream it was ghost mask scary enough in know what you did last summer it was fisher man rain slicker in the middle of summer no less and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody the villain wears an oversized parka with fury hood ooh scary intended to conceal his her identity for urban legend humbly suggest donald duck costume though must admit urban legend does have winning premise for what could have been somewhat entertaining exploitation film the film killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends you know like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they re coming from inside the house won spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used after all the film does offer fine 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough sad to say it doesn include my favorite urban legend fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and very unhappy gerbil now that would be scary before leave you would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film the first being the lack of craft the second the lack of exploitation its characters all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people ve ever spent an evening with only jared leto looking like carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day and alicia witt as the resilient heroine avoid vexatiousness the most annoying of the bunch is tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum as supremely irritating lout so irritating actually cheered his painful death and am not cruel person ironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film if viewed as vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining after all this is movie that features the kind of faux hipsters can stand getting slaughtered which is at least better than watching an entire film about people can stand not getting slaughtered
movie laced with good blend of action comedy and heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way creating dismal and unsatisfactory product eighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed minus half of its original duo the late john belushi and nearly all of its original charm dan aykroyd reprises his role as well as his co writing credit as elwood blues the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on self proclaimed mission from god along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago as we begin elwood is being released from state penitentiary along with the news of his brother death in prison years ago completely on his own elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away but elwood isn completely without family it seems he has half brother of sorts not real brother mind you just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudo father curtis cab calloway from the first film who has also passed on despite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata kathleen freeman to do otherwise elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band working as police commander cabel chamberlain joe morton has an immediate disliking for elwood who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mother affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet following elwood around is the lonely orphan buster evan bonifant who quickly learns to become mini elwood when bartender mighty mack mcteer john goodman joins the group the blues brothers band is complete and once again the group travels the country crashing cars blowing things up and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock meanwhile cab personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next to next of kin >from this point the movie turns into series of music videos with few bits of acting in between those hoping for an interesting and or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of story only the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours for those people it may be worth it for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting but when the story does intrude upon the festivities the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes musicians turned stiff actors and the pointless 10 year old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin james brown eric clapton and whole slew of others are the high points of the film but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors blues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really really love this kind of music you might kind of sort of like this movie many many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny and if you don have passion for very deep blues rock you ll be bored out of your skull much of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd self serving vanity project but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this none of the excitement is passed on to the audience and seeing three guys in three piece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long unfortunately those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film
the 13th warrior reeks so badly of melodrama and poor acting that it carries worst scent than canine least appetizing residue the best part of the film would be close contest between the closing credits and brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely beyaz and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the projector my vote goes for the ending credits where you can start trying to put the awful experience behind you ibn fahdlan antonio banderas is an important official who is banished from his home for sleeping with another man wife he encounters group of norse warriors who convince him to join them on mysterious journey to be taken by 13 men fahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last warrior in moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that numerous persons at the screening attended broke out into laughter the movie proves to be new low point for banderas who acting seems closer to that of his role as the lover and caretaker for dying gay man in 1993 philadelphia than that of warrior in the film supposed pay off scene he exclaims was wrong these are not men line intended to be the most memorable quote of the production unfortunately banderas delivers it in fashion that makes chevy chase career look like oscar material the film based on michael crichton best selling novel eaters of the dead was shot under that name some three years ago and after numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony but the plot is incredibly difficult to follow at the same time the 13th warrior makes you think about numerous questions questions like why do the characters always have perfect lighting on them even when it is pitch dark why does no one ever have blood cover both sides of their face but rather just one side and finally will the manager give me refund 90 minutes into the 103 minute film man invites of the warriors come with me there is woman who can help unfortunately there is nothing that could help this film the most appropriate ending would have been for the 13 men to join hands form chorus line and break into rendition of springtime for hitler
ve heard it called jaws with claws and that fair summation of the plot though that tag line does little to quantify quality director stephen hopkins blown away predator and screenwriter william goldman maverick misery would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build bridge to the 20th century they ve stacked the deck with two big stars val kilmer michael douglas bigger production design beautiful photography by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond and score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music the movie doesn make lick of sense though either as an epic or as your basic boo fest in fact some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that you may think you ve stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater 3000 the movie how about the three guys with rifles who trap lion and then can even hit the damned thing or the ham on wry acting of michael douglas who chews more scenery than the animals ever do or my favorite lions so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops
movies can do the two big es very well educate and entertain in the best of all possible worlds they accomplish both on the kirmizi planet they fail entirely in the near future manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth this film does remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be after some mumbo jumbo about an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie does the ground crew of people you couldn care less about is trapped on the surface without food water or air and stalked by deadly rogue cyberdog the one potentially interesting character carrie anne moss spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to computer attempting to graft 2001 esque space mysticism with terminator robot horror first time director antony hoffman can seem to figure out what going on neither can we didn he have anyone who could step back from the shooting and make sure there was coherent story couldn he have used the money saved by only having to pay half dozen actors to hire scriptwriter there are so many mis steps every opportunity to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction why introduce the theme of faith vs science if the crewman who could comment on it disappears early only to die _offscreen_ the audience begins the film waiting for something to happen two hours later they re still waiting despite our greatest hopes there is no life on the kirmizi planet
in this re make of the 1954 japanese monster film godzilla is transformed into jurassic park copy who swims from the south pacific to new york for no real reason and trashes the town although some of the destruction is entertaining for while it gets old fast the film often makes no sense several hundred foot tall beast hides in subway tunnels sports second rate effects the baby godzillas seem to be one computer effect multiplied on the screen lame jokes mayor ebert and his assistant gene are never funny horrendous acting even matthew broderick is dull and an unbelievable love story why would anyone want to get back together with maria pitillo character there are other elements of the film that fall flat but going on would just be waste of good words only for die hard creature feature fans this might be fun if you could check your brain at the door couldn michael redman has written this column for 23 years and has seldom had more disorienting cinematic experience than seeing both fear and loathing and godzilla in the same evening
walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox anastasia but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about disney recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas the hunchback of notre dame and to lesser extent hercules with anastasia fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window some may say so what it just kid movie well if you have young kids beware as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of corpse rotting rasputin zombie whose body parts continually fall off in disconcertingly real way consider yourselves warned nevertheless the animation is quite stunning at times don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout occasionally rivalling photographic quality and yet in other scenes the hand drawn material seems of the saturday morning tv crowd which leads me to wonder was this rushed to market to combat disney the plot as anyone who had read history before knows concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916 not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened as for the plot go rent disney candleshoe you ll see 60% of anastasia there
old soldiers never die they just turn into cliches soldier film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body jungian archetypes these two opposites need each other to create whole but it difficult to integrate both often we ll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and with the help of jung magician sit around imagining grand schemes without the drive to manifest their plans much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness all they have are dreams warriors on the other hand are ready to go to war at the drop of hat and will do combat with every last bit of their energy they don care enough about anything to know what worth fighting for gladiators who live only for the battle this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know but can also illustrate societies america during the late sixties was conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers todd 3465 kurt russell is living breathing archetype chosen from birth as soldier he is raised by the government to be killing machine his childhood is cruelty and competition he is indoctrinated with the big rules never question authority winning is everything strength beats knowledge veteran of numerous intergalactic wars todd is 40 and he obsolete new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger left for dead after test battle with the best of the new killers caine 607 jason scott lee he unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 garbage world obviously our hero is still alive he finds group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health when the peace loving colonists get good look at who todd is they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world they are the other good guys these lovers find that they need warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons todd finds himself in the role of protector what could have been fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra right wing future is ruined by turning the film into cartoon the effects are mostly second rate explosions or jerky slow motion the plot is old hat we don get even glimpse at the society that created the soldiers hardly anything makes sense the film science fares badly with all the remarkable advances we ve made in just 37 years the film takes place in 2036 we re still stupid after conquering the stars for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to landfill light years away even stranger the garbage barges appear to double as time machines virtually all the trash is vintage 1960 there is nothing in the story that is not predictable the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra connie nielsen the woman just little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him it doesn take genius to foresee that her husband isn going to be around much longer is it shock to find out that the film climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine who would you guess wins some of the scenes would work if this were comedy todd first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie nipple poking through her thin blouse later as he sits by his lonely campfire tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion supposedly this clich isn meant to be humorous dastardly col mekum jason isaacs with pencil thin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash responsible for last year quirky and visually enticing but problematic the fifth element director paul anderson sees the film as shane in outer space maybe if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode the movie doesn even work as an action film there is never question as to the outcome somehow the new superior soldiers don prove much of match for todd the acting isn anything to write home about nielsen almost comes across as real person but is soon relegated to background victim russell is buffed up and does credible job but it not much of challenge uttering around 100 words during the film mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space gary busey as todd commanding officer is completely wasted in his low key role everything blows up and occasionally it looks cool sometimes the sets are impressive unfortunately occasionally and sometimes don make film most disappointing is that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote blade runner possibly the best science fiction movie ever made sharp eyed viewers will notice few obscure references to that film peoples says that this is not blade runner sequel but sidequel that takes place in the same universe although that may have been the intent in his original script the result is more like bad television series that the blade runner replicants watch to pass time perhaps those artificial humans would find this entertaining michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and wants to wish everyone an appropriate halloween whatever you like it to be
can you say dated you can if you ve seen rosemary baby which like the exorcist was thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release mystery science theater 3000 has skewered the bad films of the past but let me tell you it could do number on the good ones too rosemary baby stars mia farrow from the time she was actually good looking as an innocent housewife and her not so innocent husband john cassavettes an actor who takes an easy albeit evil road to success it all seems so harmless in the beginning mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed there also skull in the living room but it only for decoration their elderly neighbors pop in for housewarming all well for about the first hour of this slow moving film until mia eats some of the neighbors chocolate mousse and passes out when she comes to she finds herself in darkened room with bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and big evil man raping her foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen it seems like dream and when she finds herself pregnant she almost forgets about it and everyone helping with the pregnancy the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink good luck charm for her to wear around her neck and the name of an obstetrician who been in the business 66 years meanwhile mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing lot of weight before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries that when you know your health failing the only person in the movie who the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend maurice evans who calls mia up to give her the bad news and immediately falls into coma by about the two hour mark felt the same way rosemary baby is way too long and leads up to payoff that about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie guess someone put spell on this movie
capsule dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes and now something of landmark for having spawned jillion clones basic instinct worst crime is that it not just bad movie but in many ways an incompetent one as well it stupid in itself and stupid to think its audience is as stupid as it is it supposed to be thriller but the plot is dead on its feet and ultimately arbitrary it only put into the movie to jerk us around it also supposed to be sexy but it instead got the unpleasant rawness of teenager showing younger kids his collections of dirty pictures it ripoff the story opens with rock star being murdered while in the throes of orgasm the biggest suspect is an authoress catherine tramell sharon stone who wrote novel in which the murder was eerily presaged or maybe it the work of copycat these and other plot threads get fed to the detective who on the case michael douglas who has few problems himself like we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor we can measure with stopwatch the time from them setting eyes on each other to the moment they are doing the mattress dance joe eszterhas has written the screenplay and he uses device that he used before in the much better jagged edge the killer identity is kept secret until the movie final shot this isn in itself problem the problem is that up until that point we ve been given nothing to work with every clue in the movie every clue is ambiguous the whole thriller aspect of the movie is shill red herrings dead plot threads violence and kinky sexuality litter the movie like potholes in manhattan streets they add up to zip because they re not happening to people we care about douglas character is foulmouthed and bitter and that it stone character has an iron on smile that never changes the rest are forgettable when we don even have the luxury of giving damn about anyone in the movie who cares what happens in it especially with an ending that is not only unsatisfying but in many ways inexplicable friend of mine once came up with rule of thumb about movie characters if no one in the movie behaves like anyone you know or would care to know just leave one of the nastier things about the movie is the way it treats lesbianism not as an integral part of someone life but as kind of kink something to thrill men with despair whenever encounter this kind of stupidity in mainstream entertainment are we still so culturally neanderthal that the only way to include something like that in big budget hollywood film is as hefnerism
possibly the years the most anticipated film and finally it arrives here in the uk it smashed box office office records in it opening weekend and will no doubt do the same here but is it any good in word no ll elaborate further the story is as follows apparently there were two islands with dinosaurs on one where the dinos lived untouched by mankind and the other tourist attraction which failed before it even opened see jurrasic park imgen the company that funded jurrasic park want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island and move them to new attraction in san diago realizing what bad idea this is proffessor john hammond richard attenborough decides to send team to document the dinosaurs so as to rally public support to preserve the island enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there so basically what you have is this two teams one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other trying to document them being forced to work together fighting for survival against the dinosaurs firm intentions on eating them fairly good idea however it let down by one slight problem it crap over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring way too quiclky add to this terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation and you end up very disinterested it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like what for tea and should you cut the lawn later yes you should it shame then really that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is blatant cash in which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park with only few creative and genuinely tense scenes and fabulous dinosaurs the rex have to be seen to be believed there is nothing else to recommend the lost world very dissapointing sequel indeed
actually fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie baywatch babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double on the small screen at least there you don have to pay to see her cleavage and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless hate to burst your bubble but there are no full fledged nude scenes in barb wire you wouldn be reading this review right now if had known that fact going in can go back in time and reverse my mistake but can warn other horny teenage boys out there they do tease us few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude it so quick you can even tell for sure whether you re seeing her andersons or not nipple hallucination sort of thing barb wire was adapted from comic book interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like comic book character in real life even wearing low cut leather to do office work businesswoman bondage wear and having unreal body proportions yes like the mona lisa pamela anderson is man made beauty probably in more senses than one she is definite beauty though and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience you just think the woman who began her career as playboy playmate wouldn have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie because it obvious she wasn pulling sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills mean she shows off more cleavage here than jeweler convention the movie is set in the year 2017 the worst year of my life pam says the worst movie of the year say america is going through second civil war and pamela is nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation silicone valley think she also hires herself out as bounty hunter when the price is right posing as first stripper and later as prostitute but don call her babe she hates that and reminds us of that fact way too many times imagine woman who does trapeze strip tease in bar while having hose sprayed on her being referred to in such sexist demeaning term liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn have to hear words like babe during strip tease especially since that movie about the talking pig was such success the plot ha ha revolves around pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate retina scanners in the words of one of the characters they re more than meets the eye reminds me of the transformers cartoon and sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent but that never happened no the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van damme big busted kickboxer and her resistance accomplices ex boyfriend axel tamuera morrison and cora victoria rowell thank god they didn name her cora reef one bad character name is more than enough pamela originally doesn take sides giving some speech about she only loyal to the money they pay her but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother jack noseworthy of bon jovi always video fame still don know if barb wire is step up or step down for noseworthy but he definitely is nose worthy even if he isn sponge worthy pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest it not rambo it bimbo mark my words barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in year it got all the elements of the direct to video releases featured on hbo bastard cousin the cable channel never watch if it didn somehow come free it got the non titillating scenes of voyeurism laughable flashbacks bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo there even narrator at the beginning setting up the movie premise while the words scroll up the screen someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain star wars if you ve seen any action flick of the past fifteen years you ll recognize plenty of lifted elements barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over car crashes explosions broken glass and slow motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death this is one of those automatic pilot movies anyone could write or direct barb wire has only two things going for it and think you know what those two things are
confucius once said governing nation is like cooking small fish don overdo it his maxim might be easily applied to writing comedy script for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make granted mike judge writer director of the workplace satire office space isn exactly an amateur his most infamous work the mtv series beavis and butt head was pure altin for its network but unfailingly judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground the iffiness in judge plot group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss is not in its appeal in fact based on the popularity of scott adams cartoon dilbert which will soon have its own television series satirical view of the american workplace is hot item in hollywood unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit length sequences which would be more at home on the set of saturday night live rather than full length feature the most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space which feature almost all of the movie top content this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated other evidence of office space failure to work are its lack of good jokes the comedy is marginally funny at best but not enough to get packed house of theater goers to laugh out loud the material in the movie is on key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting and this could partially explain his work here however the movie is loaded with too many misfires including the token plot to allow for any excuse the plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers headed up by peter gibbons ron livingston at company named initech after the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech the movie introduces us to two consultants john mcginley and paul willson which are in charge of downsizing the company payroll when peter and his gang learns of this as well as the reason behind it so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh gary cole stock will go up they set about creating plan to see his downfall the circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but sympathetic cast and muddled jennifer aniston as love interest subplot are all that keep this one together but it definitely missable in lieu of something more intelligent
there scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book screenwriting made easy this is funny the first time just cause it is but funnier as the film goes on since it totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it outlined it and then wrote this film it like they took the sub genre of the disaster pic which can be fun and hokey at the same time and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them the stupid eccentric characters yes the poseidon adventure is crap but it fun cause of all the stupid eccentric characters and earthquake my god earthquake has got to be one of the worst movies of all time but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold volcano takes semi intriguing yet stupendously inane plot volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts again later then stops only it in dare say it and then puts no stupid stereotypical eccentric characters in it they re just stupid and the actors are all good ones tommy lee jones is great an oscar winner and member of the men in siyah my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer anne heche is good indy actress don cheadle stole the disappointing devil in mavi dress from denzel feet and gaby one of the few good teenage actors but they get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at what going on they do their best god bless them but they re all lost in the fake magma only don cheadle gets an interesting part and he the greatest part of the film there no real suspense here cause you don care about anyone actually was rooting for gaby character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn have to keep saving her he did it like thirty times and there are no interesting sites in that we see get destroyed part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever in independence day the best part other than judd hirsch was watching the beyaz house and empire state building get blown up by the aliens that was cool watching really fake looking magma plow down the street is not okay so the film not devoid of merit as already stated don cheadle was great and the cast does their best and there this really moronic scene which looks cool john carrol lynch norm from fargo goes on subway car to save people but the lava comes and surrounds it he has one guy who wounded and could make it he could throw the guy and jump and still survive but no he has to go and inanely jump and land right in the middle of the lava here the cool sight he melts here the dumb part of it he somehow manages to throw the man to safety as his legs are melting cool sight no logic but cool sight the volcano erupts twice and for some reason the film ends there they aren worried about it eruting again they just go home to their toppled homes but to tell the truth was glad they didn go on was hoping the film was over after the first eruption ended my god it was actually painful to sit through this little 102 minute long film haven seen dante peak but ve heard it masterpiece compared to this if you want to see cool disaster flick that inane but interesting rent the towering inferno with steve mcqueen paul newman and the schweppervescent simpson he saves cat if you want to waste your time watching boring stupid disaster flick literally it almost grossed half of its budget see this but warned you
chill factor is carbon copy of speed with one notable exception instead of speeding bus we now have an ice cream truck the truck is driven by arlo cuba gooding jr and mason skeet ulrich who have been instructed by dying scientist to transport deadly chemical weapon to military base by the name of fort mcgruder this particular weapon nicknamed `elvis must be kept below temperature of 50 degrees or else the shockwave will goo iffy everything in mile radius that would be pretty nasty the power of elvis is revealed in the opening scene as dr richard long david paymer conducts test on an isolated tropical island long accidentally melts 18 soldiers and defoliates virtually the entire island due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance the commanding officer general brynner peter firth is sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of his troops upon his release the general is intent on tracking the good doctor down snatching elvis and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder protecting the fate of the world is drifting hamburger flipper ulrich and feisty ice cream delivery man gooding jr who must elude brynner men and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder all the while of course they must keep the weapon below 50 degrees this proves to be tricky among the wild adventures arlo and mason partake in is trip down tree covered mountainside in boat and fist fight on top of moving vehicle they also crack few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing to put it simply ll use clever pun chill factor should be put on ice director hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed broken arrow and the lethal weapon series to create lifelessly bland cocktail of chase movie when there is some occasional action the audience seems oddly detached from it perhaps that because we ve already waded through pool of clich and boring dialogue all material that been used before and with lot more spice take the villains for example they are typical stereotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen they speak lines that have been recycled profusely from one movie to the next divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint and act in very predictable ways the tag team of gooding jr and ulrich sounds much more exciting than it is frankly not sure can accept cuba as an ice cream man suppose it better than him dressed like giant hot dog selling jumbo frankfurters on street corner gooding displays one single emotion in this movie which is frequently on display in lines like `i gonna get on yo ass like last year underwear and the incessant sputtering of `oh sh this is virtually the same character he played in jerry maguire and as good as it gets but where gooding was once an exciting actor he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous at least he bit more captivating than ulrich who has all the film worst dialogue but does nothing noticeable to enliven his character the supporting cast which includes every personality you expect to pop up is also wasted to be fair there are few brief moments of serviceable action and did chuckle few times one example is when ulrich an employee at `darlene diner is at the counter when brynner walks through the door `you own this place the general asks `yeah ulrich says `they call me darlene these little tidbits of humor are mainly welcome in this weak disappointing wreckage of an action film as speed clone it could have benefited from lot more suspense and perhaps god forbid even some decent writing sadly walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could have been
at first was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer but that was before saw the film now my view has completely changed it time to embrace for impact because this is very bumpy ride the story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including jason nesmith tim allen alexander dane alan rickman gwen demarco sigourney weaver signing autographs at convention they meet fans who dress up in costumes fans who worship the ground they walk on and group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris robin sachs of course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties and meet the ugly aliens themselves thus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians the movie plays like really bad star trek episode in fact it worse don even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof because quite frankly it just not funny all the jokes are basically collected observations from the series one such continuous joke involves simple crew member who believes he will die in space because no extra on the tv show ever lives as proven in the star trek series creative jokes like this may seem like clever idea but not when they are used to death person can only take so much we do not need to be tortured especially when you have to pay for it it pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful it not like expected an oscar worthy performance form him but few laughs would have been helpful speaking of acting fine talents were wasted as well sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage well at least it worked it pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage it just shows you how disgraceful the film really is alan rickman however was not so lucky after his last hit dogma he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess it just shame to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away when the film couldn get any worse thankfully some nice special effects pop up like many big blockbusters armageddon the haunting to name few they rely heavily on effects to help boost the film box office results times it works but unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk when will it stop am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash it may look fine and dandy but we need to at least have story is that too much to ask obviously it is when galaxy quest finally ends it literally crash lands aside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic it an embarrassment to the cast and it embarrassing to the science fiction genre it not the least bit fun nor was it entertaining the only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond
the people who populate the movie 54 are shallow self absorbed and self indulgent in other words they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts 54 is the story of that well publicized new york disco studio 54 the in place in the 70s where anybody who was anybody went to be ogled photographed and pampered the difficulty with 54 which was written and directed by mark christopher is that his script takes no point of view christopher neither condemns nor glorifies the legendary excesses that were studio 54 hallmark he keeps an uninvolved distance thus keeping us from forming any emotional attachment with any of the protagonists the movie one main asset is the surprising performance by mike myers as steve rubell the famous owner of the nightspot he is part rebel part dreamer part shrewd entrepreneur he smart enough and childlike enough to pander to the dreams and desires of his clientele yet stupid enough to brag on tv about hiding profits from the irs myers in his first straight character part is in turn appealing and appalling at one moment he can try to pressure male employee into sexual situation then at the next moment apologize for his bad behavior and offer the young man handful of cash the story is told by shane shea ryan phillippe new jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to the big apple shades of john travolta brooklyn bound tony in saturday night fever eventually shane does come to new york attracts rubell eye and is admitted to the promised land his looks get him job as busboy and he is later promoted to the prestigious position of bartender where he mixes with and makes drinks for the rich and famous shane dream is to meet soap star julie siyah neve campbell fellow garden stater but both characters are so sketchily drawn that even when they do hook up it no big deal the chemistry between shane and julie is nonexistent 54 is very cold uninvolving movie it all strobe lights and glitz all substance it sort of like the musical era it covers
big busy boxing satire with surprisingly paltry punch the great beyaz hype stars samuel jackson as shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay per view revenues is to invent beyaz contender peter berg to challenge his siyah heavyweight champ damon wayans the logic is that people will pay more to see siyah vs beyaz than siyah vs siyah he may be right in an absurdly accurate way but the film doesn give us reason to care as scathing sports spoof hype is just that unfunny unfocused and at times just plain pointless as commentary on race relations it even less effective the dialogue is the best of this mess lines like jon lovitz exclaiming cannot make caviar out of fish eggs writers tony hendra and ron shelton also do good on the street slang though we never hear enough of it the script isn strong enough though to support the aggressive camera work of director reginald hudlin house party he comes across as absolute overkill the great beyaz hype almost turns around at the end at the big match when hudlin attempts an extended gag of rock concert proportions with costumed dwarfs gangsta rappers and the champ dressed as death only then do we get glimpse of the spoof that should ve been
by starring in amy heckerling clueless two summers ago alicia silverstone proved she wasn just another pretty pouty ingenue showing buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs namely stint as the aerosmith girl and silly turn as the lethal lolita of the crush out of the water her only work since that 1995 gem has been in june batman robin where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl now she the star and producer of excess baggage hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level silverstone emily hope is stuck with billionaire father jack thompson who neglects her emotionally in an outlandish plan to gain his affection she fakes her own kidnapping emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set pricey ransom ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw but before the police can rescue her professional auto thief vincent roche benicio del toro jimmies the locks hot wires the engine and makes off with both the car and emily who still trapped in the back when vincent discovers emily the two don exactly hit it off she annoys him he annoys her and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner harry connick jr he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there along the way of course they get into whole heap of trouble and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky felony studded situation it doesn help matters that emily and vincent are being trailed by cops crooks and even her shady uncle ray christopher walken who wise to his niece ploys for attention and has mafia connections for at least half hour excess baggage bounces along fast and efficiently during this time emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as nice role reversal twist she an awfully aggressive combative victim and he quite the aloof seemingly vulnerable captor but once it past its set up the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once road movie teen comedy mob thriller drama about family relationships you name the cliche and excess baggage likely covers its territory of course romance develops between the two leads but it all seems forced and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome do you like my tummy emily coos to vincent at one point in the film huh did miss something the hard edged foul mouthed grrrl is suddenly gone and replaced with pair of batting goo goo eyes then again excess baggage becomes so weak in so many areas that the personality transplant is not complete surprise supporting cast attempts to do what they can with colorful but empty secondary roles but the movie isn game enough to use them all and therefore seems overcrowded motivations keep shifting resulting in an often confusing narrative scant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions excess baggage has too many characters too much plot and juggles with one arm behind its back and remaining shaky hand loved silverstone turn in clueless as an aloof pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen emma looking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there it simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that had mustered for excess baggage sadly however excess baggage is no clueless but on the other hand it is clueless
because scientist that what we do dr alexander mccabe bob gunton in response to why he created evil bats alright folks stop me if you ve heard this one genetically altered animals wreak havoc on town and small band of locals assisted by specialist in the particular animal field must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth oh yeah the military is on their way to bomb the town as well so they are running short on time sound familiar such is the plot of the destination films release of bats dina meyer stars as the bat specialist sheila who is pulled from her research along with her annoying sidekick played with irritating deftness by leon in order to help small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently with the help of the local sheriff lou diamond phillips cdc official carlos jacott and scientist bob gunton sheila discovers it is indeed bats who have been genetically altered by gunton character to be more aggressive and omnivorous in order to be used as military weapon have to say here that knew exactly what was getting into going into this film there not frame of promotional footage have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good in this respect the film never disappointed me this film reaches level that transcends the so bad it good level and borders on the downright insane the effects are awful the script is contrived and for most of the feature was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously think challenge anyone to sit through the scene where bat stalks baby in crib while another bat terrorizes patron eating at diner with straight face thankfully the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in johnny mnemonic dragonheart and starship troopers the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit and this one is no exception while one never really gets the impression that meyer character could be bat expert in reality one never really cares to doubt it either she gives as good performance as could be expected plus she nice to look at for an hour and half lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what going on in town for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats the only bad performance in the film is that of leon he is relegated to the not sticking around here character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays anyone who can immediately tell that bob gunton the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised but highly doubt it even if he hadn been the villain in just about every film he ever been in so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever in fact his death is welcome because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale if the plot doesn sound ridiculous to you yet then check out these little tidbits multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when police officer cocks his pistol an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor orders to stay indoors after curfew is instigated causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force killing several townsfolk government official blows off shelia instructions to wait until dawn to install cooling unit in the bats cave that will kill all of them off by pulling night job resulting in the death of an entire military unit cavern full of bat feces never ignites when phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it finally to top it all off this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it single screen theater for reference our town has over million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens and we re lucky to even get kevin smith dogma the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill conceived bat puppets while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what going on the scenes where bat is called upon to interact with live actor are usually shot more low key therefore we the audience get loving close ups of the most unrealistic rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film being able to see the puppeteer arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse after all of this if you still decide bats might be the movie for you don say you haven been warned trust me when say that it lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in she definitely talent that is going to waste in films like these
the word to describe sharon stone is wonder not that she _is_ wonder but rather that wonder how she can be so inconsistent she has dynamic screen presence in basic instinct turns in surprisingly fine acting job in casino but possesses neither of those here stone teams up with private school headmaster wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani thoroughly unlikable husband chazz palminteri in comedy of errors and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock as in `homage to [read steal from it turns out that someone saw them or he not dead or maybe kathy bates turns in credible if unspectacular performance as an investigative police detective her character is bit dull but realistic although her actions at the end are puzzling adjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation it stone that is disappointment among the actors how can she be the epitome of femme fatale in previous films and come off as blank in this one costumed in skin tight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring not enticingly dangerous even the threat or promise of lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out on the positive side there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive that is if you can put up with stone cardboard cut out character and scenes directly lifted from hitch movies
warner brothers rated pg 13 mild violence sexual situations 132 minutes director luis mandoki screenplay gerald di pego from the novel by nicholas sparks cast kevin costner robin wright penn paul newman illeana douglas robbie coltrane jesse james john savage review by geoff berkshire not an overly cynical guy there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years however have my limits and also have standards this brings us to the subject at hand message in bottle the big ticket romance that warner brothers unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine day the story what little of it that there is involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne robin wright penn dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason jesse james during brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in bottle while on morning run by the ocean the letter written to mystery woman named catherine instantly captivates her upon her return theresa shares it with her best friend lina illeana douglas her boss charlie robbie coltrane and the entire city of chicago the newspaper publishes an article about it it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake kevin costner and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down he turns out to have colorful father paul newman but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship of course she doesn tell him that she found his letter she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later preferably right after they first make love this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened the discovery of the message and garret discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and quarter hour running time of this film there truly lame subplot about garret relationship with his dead wife family he gets into bar fight with her brother played by john savage and then the necessary tear jerking ending fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced and unintentionally humorous sequences filmed since well since costner the postman 1997 message in bottle is one slow moving film last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe siyah but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work message in bottle has decent enough cast but they re fighting the material all the way and losing badly costner and especially wright penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry the supporting players are given very little to do the reliable douglas is particularly wasted old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of film confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played however too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story gabriel yared who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient 1996 and city of angels 1998 with his scores overdoes it bit here caleb deschanel camera makes everything look little too beautiful do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times the real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego working from best selling novel by nicholas sparks which have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times its strict adherence to clich brings to mind such disasters as still know what you did last summer 1998 there simply isn an original scene in this film the dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking this is director mandoki first film since when man loves woman 1994 the solid meg ryan andy garcia romance he simply going through the motions with this message in bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come 1998 as one of the most misguided romances of the decade
running time approximately 1hr 40mins reviewed by jack choo rating the movie starts with rather se7en ish opening sequence rather cool and sets the mood for things to come the story propels the audience into neo reality somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of mavi and kirmizi existenz is actually the name of new virtual reality game supposedly vr games are highly popular as is considered legal drug in this neo reality leigh is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate game experience in the form of existenz players are required to have bio ports embedded in their spine which plugs to game pod in order to enjoy the immersive experience during secretive beta testing cum teaser meeting for this new game an assassination attempt on life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard law is more of realists than anything else afraid that he ll lose reality if he begin to play these games but requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt as they soon discover they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected existenz has all the cronenberg gore that is expected of him even so this film is no where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners not even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly existenz can probably be looked upon as his 90 version of videodrome even so it is poor follow up while in most of his famed films his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot in existenz the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of over indulgence than anything else jennifer jason leigh and jude law both commendable actors looked aloof and miss directed throughout the entire film the scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the grade category it was obvious that cronenberg worked on really tight budget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film the opening sequence though probably formed considerable portion of the budget which is actually quite good existenz is too predictable and cliched in these times 10 years ago it would have been another classic for cronenberg cronenberg fans however those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film should not give this film miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you
synopsis easily angered chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five years after their divorce diedre easily cons david not so bright new wife molly into believing she child psychologist so that she can influence molly and david quick tempered son michael diedre at the same time murders bunch of people comments the ex is very bad movie haven seen turkey of this magnitude in quite while kept vacillating however between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ultimately decided to split the difference and give it two stars as summarized briefly in the synopsis this is yet another spurned psycho lover gets her revenge type movie not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline but it seems like 10 000 000 000 the ex however though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre differs slightly from the norm in that at least it doesn take itself too seriously like so many other duds do malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind those involved in the movie realize they re in turkey apparently and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script the ex storyline as said incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature however the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that after while the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie diedre david first wife kills and kills and kills for example without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like it not as though she bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime david and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael their son has emotional problems specifically his inability to control his anger though david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie the connection between him and his son is not made molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son time and time again things do not add up in this movie if viewer can accept this fact then he will definately not like the ex if on the other hand he can appreciate the movie for its campiness then he ll probably like it much better don mean to necessarily suggest however that the ex is memorable exercise in camp even when viewed from an it so bad it good angle this movie isn all that successful the ex does have its moments though almost all of which involve yancy butler the psychotic diedre and nick mancuso david these two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which oftentimes elicit chuckles from the audience the truly awful lines written for them help this humor along butler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue every time her character kills someone she has punchline that unbelievably inane when she murders tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david for example diedre whacks the elderly lady with crowbar and states so sorry your lease is terminated or how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene diedre therapist wishes to have her recommitted so she decides to visit diedre alone in her new apartment never realizing of course that it not her therapists typically are catatonically brain dead in these movies having successfully snuffed the woman out diedre looks at the body and says what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session dr jones oh that right sorry but your time is up this is what passes for humor in the film the audience doesn necessarily laugh but groan the type of groan that suggests the audience can believe they re watching this crap although watching it they are nick mancuso chainsmoking nervous wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler character delivers but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief in between drags off his cigarette for instance in one of the movie best scenes david tries to explain to his lawyer what creep his ex wife is in exaggerated exasperation he nearly shouts the woman is cuckoo bird trust me it is funny in context and so the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion won reveal the ending specifically though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review but will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film molly and david own cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds molly at one point in the film not so brilliantly observes after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family to spy upon them that she crazy you be pretty crazy too if you rented this turkey avoid it unless it on tv and you come across it if you do you may want to watch it groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot and feel good that you didn spend money renting it

1989 major league was delightful surprise didn expect much of it when decided to watch it on cable but it proved to be fresh and funny however when the appeal of movie is its freshness the sequels are virtually guaranteed to be stale that certainly true of major league ii and the most recent entry major league back to the minors the title is of course contradiction shouldn it be minor league that contradiction suggests the lengths to which writer director john warren has gone to squeeze third movie out of the formula established by the first movie original stars charlie sheen and tom berenger who returned for major league ii are not around leaving corbin bernsen the only original headliner to make the third movie the other veterans who return dennis haysbert as voodoo inspired batter cerrano and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka who was introduced in league ii seem to be around just to lend legitimacy to the enterprise the only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle inexplicably broadcasting the games of minor league team far from his home turf the protagonist this time around is retiring pitcher gus cantrell scott bakula who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn bernsen to manage the twins aaa team the buzz you can write the movie from here he finds group of misfits who need to learn how to play together as team in order to win there future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing walton goggins an ex ballet dancer kenneth johnson broken down old timer thom barry twin outfielders both named juan the difilippo triplets and couple pitchers with throwing problems judson mills and peter mackenzie along the way gus picks up cerrano and tanaka gus is supposedly an old teammate of theirs even though he wasn in either of the preceding films sum total none the entire enterprise is artificial and the cast is not ready for the hollywood majors gus antagonist is twins manager leonard huff ted mcginley leonard is slimy sniveling little egotist and the twins are lazy spoiled and full of themselves even watching the first movie wondered why any real life team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner gus challenges leonard to match the buzz vs the twins wanna guess who wins back to the minors is movie that has no reason to exist there hardly laugh in it the cast is weak and the first movie left no room for even one sequel
here rarity children film that attempts to tackle weighty subject is there god done well it could have been gem among the wasteland of modern children cinema unfortunately it isn with jumbled messages and an unclear audience wide awake was better left asleep fifth grader joshua beal joseph cross is in the middle of moral crisis his beloved grandfather robert loggia has died and joshua has begun quest he wants to find god to discover why bad things happen this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents dana delany and denis leary but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths at his catholic school his favorite teacher sister terry rosie donnell tries to give him guidance but this is journey he must make on his own meanwhile he is having the most momentous year of his life he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave timothy reifsnyder he gets his first crush and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey it is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be on its surface it appears to be kid film however it deals with serious issues and is likely to be boring for today instant gratification kids and while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience wide awake asks serious questions but only delivers cheap gimmick for an answer if there were bit more meat in the story adults on nostalgic bent might get kick out of the movie the actors who might have created great cast donnell leary and delany are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos the nostalgic elements best friend favorite teacher first crush etc have been done much better in other movies and actually seem more like filler here the film strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua relationship with his grandfather they show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie maybe the film would have been better if instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks it were set entirely during joshua last year with his grandpa it certainly would have been more entertaining wide awake can best be described as failed experiment it starts out with noble aspirations but never delivers on its promise parents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions that is if their kids aren bored to death first
this is crap but honestly what older american audience is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon and james garner as bicker ing ex presidents especially when their supporting players in clude dan aykroyd as the current commander in chief lauren bacall as former first lady and john heard as the dan quayle ish vice president yup you re talkin pre sold property here and for warner brothers the perfect fit into their now ritual grumpy old men holiday slot for the non discriminating viewer my fellow americans is fine the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political thriller road comedy they did in mine heaven help us for the rest of us the movie is immediately tiresome the tone is terrible and the banter is worse forget wit lemmon and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie has anyone counted the number of first penis references sure some of the bits are absurdly funny including men room macarena joke the appearance of an elvis impersonator on trainload of tarheels and an all dorothy marching band performing over the rainbow at gay men march the get there from here though you have to submit to one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores of all time judas priest is there single moment of silence in this film even the dialogue gets drowned out what waste
fantastically over hyped godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands then an attack on boat from some beast and finally we join dr nick tatopoulos broderick looking about 17 years old doing some research in chernobyl some shady government guys appear and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints from what looks like giant lizard and what more this beast is heading for new york gulp although godzilla should be non stop roller coaster ride and at some points it is there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie the main faults lie with the acting and writing common problems with summer blockbuster movies broderick is pretty useless as the hero with no humour or tough guy image while emmerich previous summer flick independence day 1996 had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith this has neither also maria pitillo as broderick former girlfriend is just as useless with chronic disability in acting she incapable of showing emotion speaks every line in the same way and basically she total crap it up to french actor jean reno to save the day and indeed he does turning in campy performance as french secret agent shame he has such little screen time in such overlong film hank azaria also turns up as crazy cameraman named animal and he adds little life to the picture also making an appearance is harry shearer probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons as slimy news reporter so the acting is not up to par but it never is in these movies but what about the script well that not up to par either emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write script the dialogue is banal broderick looks at lot of fish and utters that lot of fish and the character development is non existent reno plays the typical frenchman no croissant broderick forever remains geeky scientist also the film is seriously lacking sense of humour the jokes that are uttered are pathetic and there an hilarious running gag about siskel and ebert the mayor is mayor ebert and is assistant is called gene ha ha ha ha the plot is dire and in the end just rips off jurassic park 1993 by having lots of baby godzilla velicorapters running around new york right so the script and acting suck but what about the special effects thankfully they re are quite good godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi although we don see much of him because the movie is so dark the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell but although they are impressive they can save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie the movie goes on for far too long aswell and it can seem to decide on ending and of course the ending itself leaves possibility for sequel let just hope one never arrives
whether or not would be considered trekker probably depends on whom you would ask have been fan of both the original series and its recently retired follow up as well as the even numbered entries in the film series however have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs data somewhere along the line the star trek film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category and star trek generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction its production values may be high but the writing is frequently appalling and instead of script has collection of references in jokes and ill defined characters generations opens in the late 23rd century where members of the original enterprise crew including captain james kirk william shatner are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name no sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than distress signal brings them to the nexus mysterious ribbon of energy among those rescued from the nexus is long lived alien dr soran malcolm mcdowell but he is none too pleased at being back in the real world seventy eight years later soran is still trying to get back to the nexus and again encounters an enterprise this one led by captain jean luc picard patrick stewart soran plan involves destroying star with an inhabited planet and the only hope for saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains don think it is an insult to fans of star trek to suggest that to certain extent the particulars of plot are not really the most important elements in trek film it about chance to visit with old friends and if they are involved in truly interesting story it can be considered gravy but even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent and in generations that just doesn happen data brent spiner is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing in the film major sub plot data decides to use chip which will give him human emotions chip he has had in his possession for over year what is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step he doesn get joke once the chip is in place spiner gets to have lot of fun with data new emotions but the point is that he no longer the data we know if the rest of the next generation cast fares any better it only because they re on the screen so little that they re simply window dressing but then again this story isn really about the new crew it about kirk and picard the cowboy and the politician sharing the screen the huge surprise is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away perhaps because he knows this is his last go round in the part that made him legend shatner looks like he having the time of his life stewart on the other hand borders on the deferrential and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast stewart edginess is indicative of what may be very bad sign for paramount hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was these are clearly the not ready for big screen players by contrast the prologue which features scotty james doohan and chekhov walter koenig is the highlight of the film these characters have become part of the popular mythology and when they take over the enterprise in moment of distress it moment of high energy only thirty years of history can create moment like that and that time this new crew doesn have it certainly doesn help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again it also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in shared nudge of recognition wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the trek universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on and what waste of malcolm mcdowell who could have been great monomanical villain but should have been given much more compelling reason for his obsession there are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at but to do so would be to ignore generations major flaws however would like to make one recommendation seatbelts not just for the enterprise crew although you think by the 24th century space travel wouldn involve rolling around on the floor during battle no think the audience might need them more this journey is one bumpy ride
jackie chan kicks his way into van damme territory with twin dragons an embarrassingly bland action comedy of mistaken identities chan plays separated at births boomer and john ma whose drastically different paths aw forget the plot description it not even worth the space but let face it no one goes to jackie chan movies for the plot anyway the scenes where nothing happens in chan films have always been little more than glue thriftily spread to hold the action sequences together in the case of twin dragons however the tiresome plot driving scenes fritter away so much of the movie that you almost want to shout at the risk of demeaning the artistic value of cinema get to the good part already most of the film is devoted to showing the brothers efforts to hide the other existence from their own acquaintances why it is necessary to do this is not satisfactorily explained but neither are lot of aspects of the plot the twins love interests demure club singer barbara chan film regular maggie cheung and lusty bride hopeful tammy nina li chi get disoriented in all the brouhaha yet strangely seem not to mind that they are not sure which brother they are in love with the scenes describing the boys bumbling antics get stretched so thin we stop caring who chan is supposed to be in any given shot in several shots in fact even the make up and hair people seem to forget which brother is which even chan so corny it funny humor is off kilter in this outing some of the gags are so carefully innocuous they re annoying case in point whenever anyone sees the brothers together they fall to the ground in dead faint are we laughing yet as usual the final showdown is the film jewel tour de force display of chan agility and grace never mind that it not clear how the brothers end up fighting suited bad guys inside an automobile crash testing facility it all good fun but too little too late perhaps chan next movie should just be collection of the last fight sequences of all of his movies they could call it jackie chan the final fight scenes and everybody would go home happy reviewed april 14 1999 at loews theaters beyaz marsh beyaz marsh md
this is film that was inclined to like at the outset the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st elsewhere for several years and had understood that the director screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations nor were they satisfactory if had to list reason why but that would be getting ahead of myself besides it not immediately clear as there are so many problems with the film adam arkin plays grade school teacher who is sardonic cynical and somewhat abrasive but good teacher he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on nearby court one day he meets drifter david morse who plays jack morrison on st elsewhere in the park and inveigles him in game of one on one basketball morse turns out to be good and friendship slowly develops between the two as their respective professions progress on the screen arkin teaching and morse selling of paper flowers to passing motorists so far my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack good music to be sure but it doesn replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story it makes the film somewhat minimalistic technique rarely admire suddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse introduction to fellow teacher of arkin woman arkin has long admired from afar but it too reticent to approach it appears that she begins to admire morse who enjoys here attentions but isn sure what to do about it she doesn realize that he is drifter and knows nothing about his past and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else until then had only vague dissatisfaction with the film the conclusion is where it begins to evolve into full fledged failure the woman at least to me appeared to be fairly shallow didn realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse somehow this is made to appear as if it is arkin fault and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he gotten such find of girlfriend frankly dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make punching her in the mouth not the least after this the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural if had to summarize major gripe it that this is story spread too thin that creates semi likable characters at the outset and then suddenly jerks them into being 16 year olds at the last moment it might be true to life with some people but that doesn mean have to like it don avoid

fullyloaded entertainment review website coming soon hunter thompson fear and loathing in las vegas written in 1971 is already an american classic not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post psychedelia of the 1960 but also because it ushered in new form of journalism known as gonzo soon after the book was written hunter thomspon became the basis for character in doonesbury known as uncle duke and that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas the movie although the book is one of my favorites now agree with thompson own assessment of the novel as unfilmable the main problem is that the book although detailing wild drug use and tripped out adventures was not written on the road it was written and edited by hunter thomspons relatively sober at his home so although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use it is told with sense of aloofness and some humor hunter thomspon the narrator while always drugged out still has grip on reality and can still tell with journalistic ability what is going on around him not so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas despite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped the movie is an exact duplicate of the book in terms of dialouge unfortunately this can get annoying in the form of johnny depp who plays thompson excessive narration and the characters while having vivid personalities are played as characers on the screen dr raoul duke johnny depp the name raoul duke was an alias of thompson and his riding companion dr gonzo benicio del toro who is large samoan lawyer have no personalities or emotions at all save for stoned the film is very faithful to the plot what there is of the book in that dr raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400 and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs from there one set of stoned adventures after another happens including one of the few good scenes in which depp high on acid watches all the people in the bar around him turn into literally lounge lizards while the movie has its moments few it is almost unwatchable at parts especially towards the end despite lot of celebrity cameos the stars never get off the ground the set decoration and costumes are great and probably deserve an oscar nomination however as we all know it not sets or effects that make movie its the characters and quite frankly these characters are no good

in the james bond film diamonds are forever tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads bond response is that it doesn really matter as long as collars and cuffs match well collars and cuffs don match in the real blonde what might have sounded good on paper ends up as largely unfunny meandering comedy on screen the film supposedly satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business is wafer thin it plays like an ally mcbeal episode dragged out to the nth degree replete with few unnecessary fantasy sequences writer director tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is fresh idea it isn the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary matthew modine plays joe struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent he 35 with no agent and no credits since he too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas that not really acting he tells his girlfriend of six years mary catherine keener with whom he bickers constantly about sex but they need the money so joe finally agrees to take part in madonna video but it not really madonna starring in the video but lookalike played by elizabeth berkley still trying to jump start her career after showgirls this points out how artificial this whole business is one supposes dicillo has referred to the real blonde as off kilter but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff the film which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere is remarkably on kilter and with perhaps the single exception of the always likable modine who not afraid to stand around in very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks the entire cast is vague and uninteresting catherine keener who appeared in dicillo previous three films including the brilliant living in oblivion is at her most annoying in the real blonde look at her closely she really can act at all her reactions are all wrong almost always out of sync with her co stars she reacts too soon or too late to lines and situations she moves her eyes or her mouth far too much she frowns she yells she babbles she blows chunks maxwell caulfield plays joe actor waiter buddy bob the one obsessed with dating natural blonde bob personality not to mention caulfield acting ability parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera passion crest stiff and uninteresting maybe that the point daryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title soap dish who beds bob both on and off camera hannah looks about fifty in this movie she only 37 why is that almost all the women in the film wear tops that show their nipples why is that marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer and so on the best parts of the the real blonde are the beginning and the end brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog there more depth and sincerity in single close up of her expressive face than in the entire film while this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters lives the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if it funny
what your favorite new york moment this one climbing the charts starring john cusack kate beckinsale eugene levy molly shannon directed by peter chelsom rated pg 13 there no doubt that 95% of romantic comedies follow distinct pattern guy sees girl guy wants girl guy goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl guy gets girl in rare cases the genders are flipped predictability is given rarely though is romantic comedy as cheap as obvious or as pointless as serendipity film that uses its theme as an excuse for its plot contrivances lightweight doesn begin to describe it this is like anti gravity it begins in new york city bloomingdale product placement that rivals cast away fedex for sheer blatancy jonathan trager john cusack and sara thomas kate beckinsale both go for the same pair of gloves after going through the perfunctory motions jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them go out for ice cream followed by ice skating jonathan falls hard and sara is charmed when she writes her name and number down on piece of paper truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand she takes this as sign from fate that they shouldn be together jonathan is flabbergasted to pacify him she comes up with an idea jonathan will write his number on dollar bill which she will promptly spend when she gets home she will write her name and number inside book love in the time of cholera and sell it to used bookstore if the bill gets back to her or the book to him it will mean that they are meant to be together three years later both sara and jonathan are now engaged to other love interests both realize they aren content both go looking for the other what happens now is so absurd that almost tempted to recommend the film for the sake of seeing it the two of them run circles around each other in set of incredible coincidences that would describe as contrivances if it weren for the film oh so cleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around serendipity of course since the movie is about fate the screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases not buying it there no suspense in any of this because we know exactly what going to happen but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly adorable non story into our heads instead of will they meet the question we re asking is when will they meet already to make matters worse every coincidence is telegraphed from mile away by the last reel was bored enough to actively look for signs that something else incredible was going to happen cusack is fine and beckinsale at least isn saddled with another lumbering clunky screenplay she had bad luck what with brokedown palace and pearl harbor on her resume just an inanely pointless one serendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing eugene levy who plays snarky bloomingdale salesman what the interest in watching movie that spirals around and around predestined no pun intended conclusion serendipity wants to tug at the heartstrings but it only tests our patience
plot summary the year is 2024 the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by shield invented by connor mccleod the shield although saving lives has made the atmosphere hot and humid connor is mortal and tired old man who has given up hope on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of terrorist organisation they have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist like zeit get it they fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield katana meanwhile fearing connor would return sets out himself to kill the highlander if you have never seen it being fan of highlander and mr connery was in the cinema as soon as could to see highlander ii the quickening wish it had been quicker feel whatever else you can say about film bad script bad music etc if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so the time mr connery is on the screen for is worth watching the plot sounds little ridiculous but was willing to give it chance maybe they could pull it off instead find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film it as if they are different people with the same names witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance where is the attitude of who wants to live forever when love must die gone to the love sub plot must have had footage cut out the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying still want to know why connor coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by quick chop to the neck know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first to be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the world worst shot meanwhile connor develops luke skywalker like powers of laser beam deflection as for bad guys we see rebellion on zeist crushed easier than grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist two assassins are sent presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems no more assassins are sent katana supposedly very powerful man goes himself to kill connor has he no more assassins has he no better why was the rebellion crushed so easily then michael ironside is totally unconvincing bring back the kurgan he seems like cartoon character and really isn that evil just stupid and violent we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening child again and killing lots of innocents yet he still seems like no threat perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn have been amiss with larry curly and mo so much for plot and characters the music is atrocious it is at best intrusive and at worst annoying bring back queen there was an audible sigh of relief when connor played queen track in juke box believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release the acting is at best flat except for mr connery lambert is uninteresting and when he delivered there can be only one this time around it just made me wish there had only been one highlander michael ironside is unconvincing sorry michael usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable so why 10 visually the film is interesting at all times it has blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film or is he smirking to himself his lines and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all but hey have done it for 12 million oh and agree with previous reviewer she does look like sharon stone but believe it is her first film incidentally there is line producer credited and hear rumours of highlander iii the wizard
the one question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film since june haven been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky shrieking out ha take on me in his yellow miata why would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine honestly was hoping that all the goofball ads were actually front for decently funny movie man was wrong corky romano is one of those throwaway clich ridden tv star to film vehicles built upon the most rickety of plots fortunately for chris kattan precariously positioned career corky does have some good laughs even if most of them are of the lowest brow variety kattan plays the title character the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who has penchant for sunshiny 80s tunes bright ties and banal coffee mug slogans you don have to be crazy to work here but it sure helps when his mob boss dad peter falk is about to be put away on murder charges his bungling lughead brothers peter berg and chris penn rope in innocent siyah sheep corky to infiltrate the fbi as an agent and steal the evidence predictably hijinks ensue if the basic plot sounds bad wait until you get into the inner workings of this clunker the writers will amaze you with the depth of their inanity corky fbi agent identity is named corky pissant that pronounced pees ahn it french he becomes first rate agent by accidentally stumbling mr magoo style onto the proper clues and talking his way in and out of situations which plays like something out of sitcom and not good sitcom mean the romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each other face and in scene taken straight from there something about mary corky gives dachshund mouth to mouth resuscitation but it not complete disaster the manic kattan does occasionally rescue some comic moments including bit featuring cat in fat suit named jesus and another involving schoolchildren german shephard and kilo of cocaine plus berg whose career has obviously gone downhill since the last seduction and chicago hope gives great turn as the illiterate brother paulie and it nice to see that richard roundtree of shaft fame is getting work unfortunately for those out there who can truly appreciate animal or fart jokes corky won have much to offer you so the next time one of those pesky ads appears on your tv asking who is corky you can simply reply who cares
tri star rated language sexual situations violence 87 minutes director and writer darren stein cast rose mcgowan rebecca gayheart judy greer julie benz chad christ ethan erickson carol kane pam grier tatyana ali review by geoff berkshire jawbreaker is the very definition of rip off this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie 1976 heathers 1989 and clueless 1995 and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich along the way writer director darren stein forgets to give the film life of its own the film opens with voice over from geeky fern mayo judy greer about the four most popular girls at reagan high courtney shayne rose mcgowan who can basically be summed up as satan in heels julie freeman rebecca gayheart good girl with the face of supermodel marcie fox julie benz dim witted blonde who demands that people call her foxy and liz purr charlotte roldan an angel in disguise liz is everyone favorite because she both beautiful and kind liz is about to turn 17 and as prank courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney car but when they open it later polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment their lives will never be the same poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat the audience is treated to few too many graphic looks at liz dead body courtney thinking fast decides to pass the death off as rape murder and marcie and reluctant julie assist her things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into vylette hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students up until about this point the film is effective enough however an investigation begins into liz death and the film becomes excessively dull the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch courtney plan to frame sleazy guy marilyn manson in brief cameo is never believable for second meanwhile the audience is stuck watching string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot julie leaves the group and begins lame romance with aspiring actor zack chad christ he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid fern rise to popularity is equally lame we do get the best scene in the film the only one with spark of originality during this section it smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school resident jock stud dane ethan erickson to demonstrate using popsicle exactly what he would like for her to do to him it at least provides us with look at courtney personality but the way the scene finishes doesn make any sense stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting william katt and soles students in carrie are liz distraught parents jeff conaway from grease 1978 is julie creepy single dad and carol kane the frightened babysitter in when stranger calls 1979 camps it up as principal miss sherman at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look the costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color director of photography amy vicent who beautifully lensed eve bayou 1997 does remarkable job here as well shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive performances are mostly sub par with mcgowan providing only few good moments compared with her excellent work in the doom generation 1995 and scream 1996 and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside high school within the last five years with the exception of actress singer tatyana ali who has small role as cheerleader the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like auto stud college stud and high school stud #2 the soundtrack is decent and imperial teen catchy yoo hoo makes bigger impression than any other aspect of the film
you think that these people only exist in the movies but trust me they re as real as life once talked to guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person brain with microwaves then sat in room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections even listened to man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted these people had what are known as conspiracy theories ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public little imagination goes long way in richard donner conspiracy theory jerry fletcher mel gibson is new york city cab driver who seems to have conspiracy theory about everything his latest that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle might sound outrageous to us but is all in day work for him he combs the newspaper looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings on behind the scenes and from there jerry draws his conclusions upstanding citizen that he is he tries to convince alice sutton julia roberts of the justice department that the president must be warned lucky gal alice who met jerry when he saved her from couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since what she doesn know is that jerry interest in her is far more than well professional he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry ideas and his limited circulation conspiracy theory newsletter he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice help one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action thriller when it seems to have neither whole lot of action nor significant number of thrills part of this is result of the film slow pace it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice and even once that is over with the rest of the film seems to be lot of boredom that every once in while stops to take break for excitement at over two hours this film could have been significantly condensed and had it running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour but even then the action scenes would not be able to save the film instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces we re treated to few of the generic scenes with the requisite siyah elements siyah helicopter men in siyah action suits and body armor siyah vehicles you know the drill they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons but for some reason guy with just bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time big deal we ve seen it all before watching the film wished donner had at least tried to use little imagination but was out of luck now when say it took forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice completely mean what one person is relative to the other and not romantic involvement oh donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring you see there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies also directed by donner than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory the two just don click and when you throw in number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether like finding out he been stalking her the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced the script in general also seems forced like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it then took it and forced it upon us dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable to the point that almost stopped listening even gibson usual gift for ad lib couldn punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest although one of jerry theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing unfortunately much of what discussed in the film is not inherently important to what going on but instead filler that starts out with potential but ends up just being extraneous because it never followed through for example jerry professes that man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in new york subway station he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to water main break hence the water in subway station and that the coroner should check the man lungs for chlorine this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him you know what happens then nothing zip nada no follow up whatsoever so what the significance okay here another one couple of well known real life assassins were found to have possessed copies of the salinger novel the catcher in the rye jerry also has bunch of copies whenever he goes into bookstore he has to buy one leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin we re never given reason to believe why this would make him an assassin not when we find out about his salinger collection not when he goes to the bookstore not later on when we get the answer to our first question the point becomes totally extraneous oh did mention that patrick stewart is in this film yeah he plays this government psychiatrist named dr jonas who may or may not be bad guy that about it for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has he nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory you can just lump him in with the supporting players with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi this guy was really likable and wish he and his character had gotten more screen time okay here my theory this really started out as great film but some of its jokes were actually true the government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security and this was what was left over
it seemed like the perfect concept what better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter than to make movie about guy with split personality it exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care to the wind to get laugh jim carrey signed on too even better the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly as schizophrenia and so forth such protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers fire proving that some people just couldn take joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy yes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie isn funny it not for lack of trying the farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most high concept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites man who after being dumped by his wife for midget limo driver decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them this of course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too forgiving nature making his job as rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult soon enough charlie repressed aggression manifests itself into second independent personality named hank deep voiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster this guy isn above crashing car through the wall of the barber shop in which he been insulted or holding little girl head underwater because she refused to stop jump roping in the street then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film runs off its tracks some have suggested that this isn problem because the farrelly brothers brand of humor doesn require plot to work they re wrong of course plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort 1996 there something about mary 1999 outside providence was technically an earlier project the brothers earlier film wasn funny merely because it contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected in mary the farrellys managed several times to pull off neat sleight of hand trick they have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion me myself irene by contrast seems to have been made by folks who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work having been produced by the same guys who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment the brothers pile on the offensive humor taking shots at race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner of bathroom jokes but they haven come up with way to make any of it fresh most of me myself irene comes off as rote by the numbers adolescent comedy the plot with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene waters renee zellweger who in more trouble than anyone knows back to new york has an ending that entirely predictable from the get go think charlie and irene will fall in love yeah me too the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven already expected them to do no matter how outrageous their actions might be compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing this stuff is almost entirely soft tossed presenting an obvious problem when gross out humor loses its shock value it no longer funny merely gross the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry take for example the subplot involving charlie three siyah sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon the incongruity of it all is funny for while with three burly siyah men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too pleasant smile on his face but by the end of the film they re still doing the same schitck it hasn been elevated to another funnier level and it hasn been dropped either that too bad because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through me myself irene reeks of wasted opportunities there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie new personality and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank actions this doesn really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie condition early on so they don have any opportunity to be surprised by it the film throws what looks like patented farrelly curve in scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script doesn go anywhere with it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax jim carrey is gifted comedian both physically and vocally but he left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in manner similar to steve martin in all of me it great showcase of flexibility and split second role shifting but none of it is terribly funny carrey doesn pull any stunts we don expect him to pull and the farrellys script doesn give him anything else to pull the situations in which he must perform the role shifting aren set up in any meaningful way perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better zellweger irene is not strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strong willed irene is nothing in particular as the film never makes clear whether she ditzy clever or neither as such she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only sane person in the film chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straight laced for movie like this he like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected after viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked but don believe it good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style if the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and still think they are they ll rebound just fine even after that happens though ll still consider me myself irene to be high caliber misfire
capsule five friends at stag party are involved in the accidental killing of prostitute the cover up attempt becomes monster that eats up the friends two wives and several innocent bystanders this was real audience pleaser at toronto but it did not do much for me low to +4 directed by peter berg who acted in the last seduction and copland five buddies go on stag outing to las vegas while cameron diaz works through the logistics of her upcoming wedding to one of them one of the buddies accidentally kills prostitute several people with no moral compass they started out with simple innocent little cocaine party and by accident look what happened they have one moral person among them daniel stern and one totally amoral person christian slater it is more selfish to let the amoral lead so they do this film is strange but not really funny or biting black comedy should actually be funny as well as strange there should be some element of satire the satire is missing here did not find myself laughing here either what we have is strange crime tale one just does not care what happens to these people the same idea of people just getting themselves in deeper and deeper has been done frequently if this film is popular it is just bringing familiar plot to new generation it begins like diner particularly with daniel stern and ends up like an extended horror crime comic book there are several logical holes in script if security man goes to investigate complaint and disappears wouldn the guests he was investigating be the first suspects someone framed for crime in the way shown would be judged innocent after minimal forensic detective work am desperately trying to avoid making this spoiler popular and situation ethics get real slamming some acting of grief is hammy and overdone more yelling than humor
saving silverman is good example of good comedy gone bad as love story it is good however as comedy it falls flat on it face think throughout the short 90 minutes laughed total of seven times and those were just chuckles at the most the movie doesn have the oomph to make it great movie and doesn have the script to make it funny movie wayne lefessier steven zahn mcnugent jack siyah and darren silverman jason biggs have grown up all their lives together they have been best friends forever and vow to stay close till the end while in bar after doing show with their band based on their love of neil diamond darren meets young woman named judith amanda peet whom he instantly falls for wayne and however think differently and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again it up to wayne and to try and begin saving silverman the performances are topnotch and surprisingly they are what keep the movie afloat jason biggs right off the flop loser does an ok job playing silverman but he is stale and flat at times steve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier and even though the movie is about silverman lefessier is really the main character and the narrator of the movie itself jack siyah is well jack siyah and he does an all right job as but he isn as funny as he has been in the past amanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith and neil diamond plays neil diamond he better at singing than acting anyway the performances in the film are good but it too bad the script isn speaking of script hank nelkan choppy script is not only badly written but not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street the trailer for the movie as with most movies gives away everything that happens in the movie especially the funniest parts somewhere saving silverman was meant to be good movie and it could have been but alas in the end it wasn dennis dugan direction is all right he adds few directorial touches here and there nothing special being simple comedy saving silverman is perfectly bad movie in more ways than one it has great cast good director and sweet story it just too bad it has bad script and is all together bad movie
any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project as perfect murder illustrates frankly dial for murder is not one of the master director greatest efforts so there is ample room for improvement unfortunately instead of updating the script ironing out some of the faults and speeding up the pace little perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial for murder leaving behind the nearly unwatchable wreckage of would be 90s thriller almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what going on so that these flaws in logic don become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled unfortunately in perfect murder the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they re happening this is very bad sign not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder of course in the case of perfect murder at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless cardboard characters perfect murder isn strict remake of dial for murder but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott play which was also the source material for hitchcock version as well as 1981 made for tv retelling emily hayes gwyneth paltrow is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover and shaker steven hayes michael douglas their marriage isn going well emily resents steven controlling instincts and as form of rebellion she is having an affair with penniless painter david shaw viggo mortensen when steven learns of the relationship he decides to confront david but his approach isn that of typical cuckolded husband instead of yelling or threatening steven offers david proposal that too good to resist for $500 000 in cash $100 000 before the rest after he is to break into steven new york apartment and kill emily of course after getting the first payment david never bothers to ask how he supposed to get the rest ultimately not sure which of the three main characters we re supposed to be sympathetic to the cold hearted husband who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune her mercenary lover who is willing to do the deed for half million or the woman who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair not only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable but they re not interesting it possible to make good movie with detestable characters see reservoir dogs but there has to be something compelling about them which in this case there isn steven emily and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes the actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks michael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep he gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife gwyneth paltrow who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors is simply awful here she now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998 worst thrillers the other being hush at least viggo mortensen jane has little fun with his part but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies the thin supporting cast includes david suchet the star of poirot as police inspector and sarita choudhury kama sutra as emily best friend perfect murder is plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end there aren many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start it surprising to see director andrew davis the man behind the fugitive involved in this mess but like his stars he too needs to earn living it just that remaking hitchcock and doing it so badly hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough
after marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors mission to mars ends up throwing whiffleball fiercely unoriginal director depalma cobbles together film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13 interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001 space odyssey instead of using these components as launching pad to create his own movie de palma stops right there refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart mission to mars takes it first wobbly steps at pre launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done during these surface scans of the characters we learn that jim mcconnell sinise has lost his wife it plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety the rest of the crew exhibit bland affability there is no contentiousness no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff but in that movie the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects it the year 2020 and this is nasa first manned excursion to the kirmizi planet crew led by luke graham cheadle arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly which they investigate with tragic results graham is able to transmit garbled distress call back to earth in response earth sends rescue team comprised of mcconnell woody blake robbins wife terri fisher nielsen and phil ohlmyer connell obstacles are put in the crew way and and they matter of factly go about solving them should say mcconnell goes about solving them time and again mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind which wouldn be so bad if the rest of the crew didn come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in situation where the entire crew mission and life is in mortal danger on team of professionals she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link women serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as reflection of male character personality trait by the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with heavy brush there is an adage in film to show don tell mission to mars does both repeatedly characters obsessively explain the obvious explain their actions as they are doing them explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them the film conclusion is momumentally derivative anti climatic and unsatisying as walked out wondered who the target audience might be for this film the best could come up with is pre teen age boys but in this media saturated era this film components would have been old hat even for them have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making good modern day movie the key to such venture is certain depth and sincerity towards the material felt no such earnestness
think that saying that the files is one of this summer most anticipated films is safe for five years the files television show has developed dedicated fan culture whose rabid devotion to the series rivals that of star trek fans the premise of both the movie and the television series is two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal fox mulder david duchovny is the avid believer whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestrial life borders on the paranoid and dana scully gillian anderson is the scientific skeptic trying to find rational explanation to mulder flights of fancy outlining

invasion and the cover up there are three central questions have heard asked about this movie will those who don watch the series be able to understand the movie yes isolated as an individual text the files can stand alone they have given enough background for anyone familiar with the show or not to understand the movie although some of the secondary characters histories may confuse the uninitiated those characters are not essential to the film this is major problem they trot out token secondary characters from the series out for an appearance and then disappear just as quickly why bring

the audience could pass for the lone gunmen still then they vanish just as quickly the television show never gives us any answers will the movie actually explain some things yes in the files we get fairly complete history of the siyah ooze what it is and what it wants we finally get some understanding of the motivations behind the shadow government there are even some subtle tie ins with contemporary ufo ology including the greys and the roswell crash of 1947 is the movie any good no the files is dreadful movie and shows some fundamental problems with writer creator chris carter talents and the relationship between cinema and television first off the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy and cliched after approximately forty five minutes the length of television episode minus the commercials the pace drops to snail crawl not long after that point when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series we wish he had not the explanations are so trite and ridiculous that one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much am willing to suspend my disbelief fair bit but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much breaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie and listening to other fans leave the cinema maybe the series too the explanations are not only absurd they are tired and unoriginal the extraterrestrials breed and gestate like those from the alien series and their craft looks like leftover set piece from independence day note that the alien movies id4 and the files are all from 20thcentury fox studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself think the files is noteworthy for being the only movie based on television series to be produced while the series was still running in comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people however rather

never happens in an american film meaning in cinema needs to be self contained and determined so when the files made that jump from small to big screen carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well he did not by making explicit what the television show left implicit carter reveals the limits of his creativity and skill when they say that fans make tv show it is

disney air bud tells boy and his dog story with twist the pooch is quite an accomplished basketball player granted for family comedy it not very funny or successful idea to begin with but it doesn seem to matter air bud is surprisingly solemn save for occasional moments of forced slapstick the movie wags its tale with straight face not very enjoyable approach if air bud had realized its own absurdity then it possibly could have been better here we re actually asked to cheer moment when the dog marches out to save the big game clad in two pairs of sneakers and even jersey its number k9 yeah whatever the movie opens as golden retriever buddy as himself escapes from his current owner abusive clown for hire norm snively michael jeter he ends up in fernwell washington where mopey new kid on the block josh kevin zegers is trying to cope with the move and the recent death of his father buddy kevin kevin buddy once the dog proves his on court prowess kevin self esteem rockets they both win places in the school basketball team with the animal as their mascot but before they can make it to the finals snively surfaces to reclaim buddy everything plays out just as one would think heavy on predictability light on an actual story the movie follows calculated chain of events kevin gloom fades snively gets his comeuppance and buddy contracts rabies and must be executed old yeller style okay that last one lie but at least it would have been quicker send off than air bud courtroom climax no joke there even faux cute musical montage where reluctant buddy gets cleaned up to splish splash paint cans are spilled and newspapers are buried all in the name of formula the end credits note that no special visual effects were used in the basketball sequences of this motion picture that very well may be true and although to see dog sink shots is quite sight movie cannot exist on feat alone but air bud doesn seem to be interested in anything else friend of mine insists he saw buddy while back on segment of david letterman stupid pet tricks can think of more appropriate connection this movie is stupid pet trick
when considering david fincher latest film the game four words come to mind don believe the hype this michael douglas vehicle from the director of seven isn nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe the film draws us in with an intriguing concept aided no doubt by the riveting trailer where jaded millionaire douglas is presented with the opportunity to enter into living fantasy this isn simply virtual reality this is real life with deadly twist on his 48th birthday nicholas van orton douglas is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother conrad sean penn conrad has special birthday present for his brother he hands nicholas gift certificate and tells him to contact company called consumer recreation services they make your life fun conrad tells him nicholas humors his brother telling him he ll call but it clear he has no time for any foolish fantasy role playing as he calls it then for reasons that are never really made clear nicholas decides to go to crs and see what they re all about he ends up spending whole day going through their screening process which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have nevertheless when it seems nicholas has been rejected as crs client the weird things start happening of course when we ve only covered about 30 minutes of screen time what else should we expect douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands one of those films basic instinct came from the creative minds of writer joe eszterhas and director paul verhoeven the premise of the game is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film total recall in that case the premise was implanting someone else memories as way to enhance one own life through dream vacation yet in both films the real goal is to create vicarious bond with the audience we live the adventure along with the protagonist reacting to each twist and turn in theory the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isn all we can do is hang on until the end of the ride when the truth is finally revealed now for those of you who forgot let me say this again don believe the hype the game is not thrilling roller coaster ride as suspense thriller it doesn do much but spin in circles by the third reel was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as endured the predictable plot is it any wonder douglas won be able to resist the charms of mysterious potentially life threatening blonde ever heard of glenn close no well how about sharon stone thought so if anything in this film surprises you at all would guess you haven seen that many films there is no suspense here trust me looked hard to find some had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations fincher aim for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas there are those that might say the game is not intended to be viewed literally would submit that is exactly the way tried to view the film the film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues there is moment early in the film where van orton realizing his game has begun smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who in on the whole thing he is charged by his paranoia he is looking at the world through new eyes it is the last thought provoking moment in the film from there on the director only wants to stay step ahead of us any significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into plot device at the outset we re told each game is tailored to the individual ultimately this game is supposed to work like crucible trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire proving his soul yet as douglas endures his personal gauntlet we re given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is wanted to like this film more than did look at it as just anothergreat idea poorly realized can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didn mean we were seeing what was really happening bryan singer the usual suspects for one film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas also there is the underrated jacob ladder with tim robbins film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism here are two examples of films that don simply manipulate for manipulations sake there are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to meaningful place one major issue that comes up in the game is whether or not the whole illusion is just highly sophisticated con game well can tell you right now after you ve spent your $7 dollars you may be asking yourself the same thing
plot lara croft is british rich and kicks lot of ass she also likes to raid tombs but when the illuminata discover that all nine planets are about to stand in alignment for the first time in 5000 years and that lara holds the key to time well needless to say they want to nab it from her oh yeah lara also likes to sport lot of tight shirts hummana hummana hummana critique angelina jolie was great in this movie there were also about three action scenes that were pretty cool to look at in this film uhhhhhm unfortunately the rest of the movie sucked bad dialogue generic sidekicks and bad guys lame mystery yoda esque moments with mumbo jumbo being sprouted about and even some crappy cgi near the end all in all this movie wasn the horror show that some of the early reviews had warned us about especially since every other scene does feature jolie torpedoes begging to burst out of her lucky shirts but it was quite the letdown nonetheless especially when you consider the major opportunity that the filmmakers had here to create cool hip woman hero based on popular video game don know guess you have to put most of the blame on director simon west who didn really tie the whole movie together all that well the film lacked energy consistent pace and well fun time felt kinda depressed while watching this movie all that father crap was horrible and the dialogue given to poor john voight to recite was just plain embarrassing and not even gonna mention his moustache hehehe why have this shite in the movie at all especially hated the scenes in which some ghost like figure friend or child would ramble on about lara croft father while all the time not giving one ounce of crap as to what they re talking about guess that called lack of character development right that when movie builds enough background into the characters on the screen so that we could actually get into it and care about them didn care about anyone in this movie and was bored during most of its let explain why we re doing all this gobbledygook moments and even though thought that jolie kicked some mighty ass damn did she look sexy blasting those guns or what everybody else around her was so goddamn boring her butler was throwaway with no personality her side kick was supposed to be funny but just annoyed me every time he said the word bugger and he says it lot trust me and all of the so called bad guys just spewed one dimension they had no spark no energy amongst them and even though few of the action scenes in the movie were cool see the trailer and you ll know which ones talking about the overall picture was lame and the dialogue and mystical bull crap just buried it even further also for movie that supposed to be about all of these exotic locations wasn necessarily impressed by any of its exterior shots and even less so with its interiors which all looked like they were shot in the same room mind you won go as far as to say that it the worst movie of the year remember that actually have to go see freddie prinze jr movies also but it definitely the worst film that ve seen during this summer movie season of course it still early and sure there are few more garbage heaps coming down the pike skip this one altogether and rent any of the indiana jones movies instead trust me you ll miss the boobs but end your night with some rock solid porn and it all good where joblo coming from raiders of the lost ark 10 10 the mummy 10 lost in space 10 the mummy returns 10 the general daughter 10 romancing the stone 10 wild wild west 10 mission impossible 10
there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of scream queen in the early 80s two of them were halloween movies but the other two prom night and terror train were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween the same god scared there some guy in mask coming after me routine she did in john carpenter classic jamie lee copies here with none of the urgency or suspense terror train takes place on where else train charted by some pre med students finishing their first four years of higher education most of them won make it to med school though and it obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains wish to hell they put radio on that train the conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone even jamie lee from the beginning he talking his head off he tells one of his co workers think on this when the last time someone built shopping mall next to train station as if it makes any kind of sense and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles of course the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find bloody body which is then gone when he brings skeptical trainman back to view it forgot to mention the prologue it party three years earlier with the same group of students two of them play trick on geeky frat pledge promising him he going to get laid they send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in noticing form on the bed she says kiss me kenny and he kisses the body on the bed which happens to be cadaver oh my god they killed kenny you bastards it sick trick and one jamie lee wasn let in on she still hasn forgiven the guy as they board the terror train you asshole you can have good time without hurting somebody the killing starts before the train even leaves the station since it new year everyone wearing disguises convenient plot device we ve seen before and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no one looking at least one of the characters says it groucho mask when the killer dons it and steps aboard it looks like gene shalit who by the way would make great killer in slasher movie speaking of weird looking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene one of terror train most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield as the magician who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music then there his greatest trick getting laid with hair that looks like that for all its attempts at visual style and substance terror train is more lionel than amtrak more prom night than halloween and nothing really worth watching only die hard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield if he truly has any fans should even attempt to watch it and it makes me wonder if horror movie set in an rv could be much worse mean when was the last time someone built shopping mall next to train station anyway terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of sleeper car
in 1989 tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather was it deep nope however it was perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was without the comic book uplift of the indiana jones and superman pictures which was true if what you were looking for was the tale of heroic man escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place if those films were tom sawyer then batman was huckleberry finn some critics glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone realized that it was something special mr lovell gave it and wrote that this is batman as batman should be mr travers called it one of the ten best films of the year the praise was deserved from start to finish the film was enthralling exciting and superb in every respect there was no doubt that there would be sequel directed by burton the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes the villains the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman take over and our epectations are always left unfulfilled when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman nose he simply gets mad and when we want catwoman to slither over batman body she gets pushed off building admire mr burton for trying to do more then entertain but the result is mess nothing works out as planned it fails both to entertain and to enlighten hints are made to the audience that this film could be blast alas these are only hints there are don misunderstand me several moments of cinematic genuis contained catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without word on the subject being said christopher lloyd is trapped by the penguin within giant cage small basket is dropped into large river but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis weak followup both career and sequel wise batman returns is sometimes dazzling but to often dissapointing
am steven seagal fan only say this now because mufti splenetik isn my real name and because probably need to explain why went into this film expecting great things any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones which we ll always hear when seagal does his limb twisting thing rarely female co lead in sight unless it real life model wife who hasn worked since weird science and usually the worst possible titles you can imagine not to mention very straightforward plots generally all round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather face himself in that same siyah outfit he been in since nico doing his my hands are sharp nimble knives thing seagal the stoic sir petrified ponytail duke of dull in the glimmer man seagal breaks out of this formula he gets sidekick attempts to banter and puts on new vest he also put on quite lot of weight small potatoes you may say man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to but damnit if it ain broke why fix it more on this disappointed person dashed expectations later as jack cole seagal is homicide detective with questionable past while he and his partner played by keenen ivory wayans are investigating series of ritual killings cole himself becomes suspect especially when background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole it turns out that cole is former trained government assassin you just can trust these homicide detectives someone whom victims used to catch just glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them and hence well you know that glimmer man thing an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of larger more threatening conspiracy that involves crooked businessman bob gunton cole former cia boss brian cox and deals involving chemical weapons the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff drawing as with his other films elements from the hotter films of the year eg se7en it the other changes that disappoint for example although there fair amount of violence in this movie there also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans probably the best known of the wayans tribe how many are there exactly from television in living colour wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal bead adorned and brocade draped cole keeping up his are you crazy part of the dialogue with wasted zest as campbell wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner eccentric habits but the chemistry between the two is minimal and seagal wooden comebacks make for painful watching cook in under seige seagal is now buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal siyah ensemble he chants refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies again benign if trite plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual heck he has to deliver punchlines and carry steady conversation with someone other than himself for large part of the film is that lot to ask of the seague too much seagal best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages and to do it silently and alone not for seagal the snappy one liners of arnold and stallone nor the attempts to show that he can act much less think no kindergarten cop no oscar just simple unadulterated deathblows that really how it must have started like minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else we trusted him we got to know him now betrayal don know if can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he going to try to be funny again ll try but it won be easy if you haven watched the glimmer man yet you might want to wait for the video to come out it easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences after all if we can depend on our fantasies what can we depend on the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice mufti spelenetik is still steven seagal fan everybody makes mistakes once in awhile

skull bones from the same college luke mcnamara joshua jackson townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year highlights the latest skull scouting report despite some anxiety and caution from others luke accepts entry into the organization soon after he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women driving new car and marveling at the $20 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account yeah dude pretty good deal eh but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating when circumstances become extreme there is no way he can leave the society except maybe as drooling vegetable the premise although lacking in originality certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense unfortunately `the skulls is neither intriguing nor suspenseful nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting it just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack the stars but not the script `the skulls is so bad it attains certain level of entertainment value with the screenplay by jon pogue immediately becoming the basis for slew of unintentional howlers first off upon their initiation into the skulls each new member has to have skull branded onto their arm afterward they are supplied with wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar will they never take this watch off and what if they forget it by their bedside perhaps their secret society was being little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed on top of this they are each given rulebook and key to headquarters gee why not member shirts but my favorite bit is this the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual agree or disagree notions when making collective decisions they are given official skull paddles when flipped to one side they indicate the member agrees with the proposal facing the opposite way means disagreement wouldn they merely express themselves verbally hell no they have to retrieve the paddles for proper vote and maybe afterward they can play ping pong still chuckling about these ludicrous details but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest the cast meanwhile combines pinch of veteran talent with dash of the `dawson creek crowd and fuses the two together ensuring that the embarrassment will be mutually shared union throughout but not entirely accomplished actors like craig nelson as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake and william peterson as fellow board member senator levritt are dealt pathetic villain caricatures and look suitably embarrassed handling them and then there christopher mcdonald who has the capacity to be fun exciting actor mcdonald charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role yes pogue makes it hat trick pray it was `snatch the paycheck and run exercise for all these actors the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better let cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character paul walker the strapping quarterback from `varsity blues is bland but passable as caleb mandrake the judge son walker preserves straight face even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie `dad just killed guy in the ritual room some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb who plays luke longtime chum chloe and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one or maybe not minute one thanks to decent set up from director rob cohen who films early sequences with sense of atmosphere and style it makes you wonder why he didn flee indefinitely from the project because while enjoyable cheese like `dragonheart and the moderate stallone thriller `daylight aren superior cinema they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash aside from unintentionally humoring the audience `the skulls gets little accomplished the thrills and action are lazy and mechanical the story is stuffed with ridiculous formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of secret underground society flick instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization we are thrust into lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage we ve seen it all before and better `the skulls is feeble little circus of stupidity so miscalculated that while it would serve as clever pun term like boneheaded seems just too generous
starring shawnee smith donovan leitch ricky paull goldin kevin dillon billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960 classic term that use very loosely to define the original about really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it kind of nostalgic campy feel the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn exactly hurt it either fast forward to the late 80 steve mcqueen isn in the remake this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years nor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role that is unless you count matt dillon brother kevin as hollywood heavy hitter the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original the only things you need now to have great special effects in movie are deep pockets it looks as if the produces of the new blob had couple of holes in their pockets the special effects in this movie are cheesy like the original unlike the original they don look campy they just look cheap one bright spot in the movie from purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith she is very attractive and can actually act which is more than can say about some of her costars in terms of plot little ball of pink goop falls from the sky seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on satellite anyway the pink stuff has taste for humans the more people it absorbs the bigger it gets and it isn the friendliest goop on the block either anyway it attacks this little town and it up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it not really but that is how it seems this version attempts to recapture the camp of the original as ve already said this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap badly acted and badly written than campy in the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness although star shawnee smith had very tiny role in armageddon the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple they all stunk out loud although some of the film smaller roles are filled with some actors that while not big stars are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows it also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible sadly it doesn work very well if you want to see big ball of goop terrorize town then would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original although that isn so hot either this newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities
if anyone had been able in 1983 to forsee late night cable show hosted by gilbert gottfried showcasing some of the worst films of the 80 they agree cab is the quintessential usa up all nite movie it one of those childish rated movies that kids would love but can see until it edited for tv it also one of those pointless almost plotless movies with hardly any laughs and strike three it pairs mr with gary busey heard gilbert say cab had an all star cast but still hoping there was some degree of facetiousness in that statement when third billing goes to two minute appearance by famed flashdancer irene cara as herself you can say damn thing about all star casts likewise for token appearances by marsha roz warfield paul rodriguez and politically incorrect host bill maher before he was somebody appearing in cab pretty much had the opposite effect on everyone else especially irene gonna live forever cara cab is an ensemble comedy from joel schumacher who would go on to direct batman forever about bunch of misfits who drive cabs you get the feeling if the police academy cadets had made different career choice this would be the result except here you have such interesting characters as the token beyaz guy busey who wants to get in tight with the blacks now before they take over the world the token jive talker named tyrone charlie barnett who wears his hair in rollers and uses the word honkey as much as possible the tough guy with the mohawk and altin chains mr real stretch for him the aspiring musician waiting for his big break maher the mexican gigolo rodriguez the woman who actually wants to drive cabs for living warfield and the guy who wants to own cab company for living adam baldwin we ve all seen dozens of bad comedies from the 80 some are fun to watch and some are actually funny this one is more or less neither you think plenty of comedic sparks would fly from the assemblage of talent whatever but cab more or less falls flat on continual basis culminating in the usual contrived hollywood finale as baldwin is kidnapped and the other cabbies have to go to rescue him it shame no one was able to rescue this movie from the depths of stale jokes and unoriginality cab has rightly earned its position on usa up all nite
one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often acclaimed director sidney lumet gloria remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film had absolutely no effect on me occurred when was driving home from the theatre suddenly realized that since had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before had not thought once about the film had just invested nearly two hours of my life in when movie is over aren we supposed to think about it for while and have conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with thought so but for one saw this particular picture by myself and #2 even if had been with someone there wouldn have been anything to talk about in the first place to be sure gloria begins with stirring rather poignant prologue in which seven year old boy family is brutally gunned down by mobsters in search of disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it right before the men broke in of course his father gave him the disc to escape with eventually the boy named nicky nunez jean luke figueroa is caught by the mobsters and taken back to their apartment meanwhile gloria sharon stone has just gotten out of prison for crime she didn commit and returns to her ex boyfriend jeremy northam to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime when he refuses to give it to her and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky she leaves with him in order to save his life but not before holding the men at gunpoint stealing all of their money and forcing them to strip nude gloria is the type of fast talking smart mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people and she never expected to be stuck with kid but she has heart of altin don they always in this type of movie and is only trying to protect the boy whom she quickly begins to form close bond with the previous incarnation of gloria by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands remains unseen by me but was no doubt superior even though can really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one regardless of the director or stars there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original but the film itself is simply lifeless with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn completely unbearable to watch liked for example very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at and keeps turning the car around then driving little ways then slamming on the brakes and turning around again these bright moments however appear long and far between and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria which is both painfully predictable and by the numbers throughout my mind was repeatedly asking the question who really cares as gloria sharon stone has adopted an over the top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn sound realistic at all in the beginning in fact was amazed at how amateurish stone performance was but as the film progressed she got better although not one of her better turns stone does have comic flare that refuses to be ignored jean luke figeroa was fine as nicky and little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted none more than cathy moriarty an entertaining actress in her own right who is billed fourth and has all of one scene as gloria friend whom she turns to for help sony the studio that released gloria obviously does not have any faith in the film and don blame them they declined to screen the picture for critics which is never good sign particularly with the high profile people involved although how much money movie makes does not determine how good it is just look at the spectacular in dreams which failed to even make the top 10 last week have suspicion gloria is going to vanish from theaters faster than ishtar judging from the opening night 00 showing saw it at where there were about ten to fifteen people present counting myself although stone can be an impressive actress just watch her in 1995 casino or 1996 last dance if you don believe me and sidney lumet can be respectable director there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of gloria was worth remaking or for that matter why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of chance to be successful
according to the publicity material with this movie the directors hope to restore good old fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness hmm you never know they just might be on to something what with the rise of geek chic lounge music and seventies fashion the ever contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own but then doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it it cheesy all right but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch that shame because in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be lot more woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise roy munson the movie opens in the fifties with roy dad dishing out the reader digest gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls shifting to the 70s for hilarious spoof of saturday night fever the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken it thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good he gives the wry derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy mccracken dupes munson into hustling job then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy hand then it fast forward 17 years later when munson is fat balding loser with prosthetic rubber hand he hopeless until he meets ishmael randy quaid an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno picking up pretty hustler claudia vanessa angel on the way with the exit of bill murray the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go and that dumb and dumber yes indeed kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour peter and bobby farrelly the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle so prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands distended nipples ridiculous hair and bull semen get set for stock fish out of water situations when city boy roy puts on beard and tries to blend in with the amish community or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking striptease and unchristian neighbour socking now don get me wrong there nothing wrong with cheap humour and had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy the trouble is that these jokes aren bold or funny enough to drive movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction it lurches from sports movie to amish mocking to road trip to sentimental melodrama pausing for broadside spoof of indecent proposal and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack never quite getting it all together some gags fall flat from lack of build up while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don do anything why the long unfunny fight in the car park why two of these why does that guy wear mascara or that guy have glass bowling ball with rose in it the film is full of these half thought through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying wouldn that be funny well no actually the actors don do the movie much favours either woody harrelson comes off okay plausibly acting dumb smart cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it but randy quaid is ceaseless ham and vanessa angel has no talent like schwarzenegger she seems more convincing playing computer creation than human take the tv series weird science please even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie climax all in all fairly useless attempt at comedy and certified no hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance we ll have to look to reinspired john waters or perhaps somebody from down under strictly bowling anyone for the definitive bowling comedy the flying inkpot rating system wait for the video little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
in 1989 director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama glory but since then he has made continuous disappointments to me at least with 1994 legends of the fall and 1996 courage under fire those two films weren bad just not very good but with zwick latest film the siege he has finally made one the siege is modern day action thriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city investigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard denzel washington and frank haddad tony shalhoub who are first hit by the ordeal when city bus explodes with several innocent people on it later bomb goes off in broadway theater killing even more they soon meet cia operative elise kraft annette bening who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist there are some movies that simply don need to be made and the siege may very well be one of them oh sure zwick thinks he is making meaningful action film since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than say die hard which also starred bruce willis this time willis is horribly wasted as general of the army who puts state of martial law over nyc during the climax whatever points the siege earnestly tried to make were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen or maybe zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place the role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical just as women were in the recent john caprenter vampires by placing them all in the category of bad guys the siege contains three fine actors washington bening and shalhoub but washington is stuck with character that contains not an ounce of even remote development bening has slightly more to do and has an intriguing character to work with while shalhoub pretty much steals the show even though again he has no real character by the climax of the siege with washington giving sermon to willis on the so called message of the story felt like had wandered into sequel to on deadly ground in which steven seagal gave 10 minute speech at the end about preserving the environment the siege is constantly heavy handed not entertaining or insightful and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save film that lacks satisfactory screenplay
these days people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run 1970s nostalgia is already wearing off and now people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s few years in the future early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia however doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon loaded weapon that in many ways symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry lack of originality and ideas being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series this film pairs two policemen jack colt emilio estevez burn out alcoholic cop on the edge and wes luger samuel jackson by the book policeman days away from retirement two of them following the murder of luger ex partner must confront evil general mortars william shatner crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies the authors of this films whose director gene quintano worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects and that reflects in the lack plot characters and even original lines the plot or what goes for the plot in this movie is nothing more than series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years apart from lethal weapon series this film borrows its female lead from basic instinct the best gags are same as with many other similar movies shown in the trailers the rest simply doesn work only those who used to watch lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh others would probably wince at the lameness of humour some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in while but at the end spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of movie is simply not worth the effort the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of series that already had strong comic overtones the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon joke in their fourth sequel
plot down and out girl moves in with some over the top models and falls in love with goofy but loveable guy from across the street aaaaaaaaah then one day she sees him knock woman upside the head with baseball bat ooooooooh she must then join together with her model friends to find out whether or not this guy is really goofy but loveable or psycho killer aaaaaaaaah critique completely idiotic okay so maybe being little too nice this movie starts off dumb moves into the ridiculous and eventually graduates to idiocy there that more like it and how you may ask well it simple really four of the dumbest stereotypical models in the world oh my god just found out that the actresses playing the parts are models in real life yipes join monica potter in role which can only be described as an obvious cry for help and freddie prinze jr not the actor but the character better known as freddie prinze jr in plot so stupid and far fetched that you have to wonder once more how crap like this gets by the hollywood bigwigs this thing stinks to high heaven it just plain embarrassing for everyone involved even felt my iq dip below its usual low as toilet humor somehow worked its way into this so called romantic comedy action movie ugh what pile of dung hey actually starting to sound little like harry knowles here but guess could see where his frustration comes from time to time it sad really movie which actually had quite few people in my audience laughing at its idiocy including the over used folks hiding in the bathroom while someone else comes in to take crap and fart gag and how about that dumb blonde model who keeps running into things pure hilarity or maybe just too jaded too much of critic not relaxed enough to enjoy this fluff piece uuuhhmmm naaaaah this movie sucks the big one it chockfull of stupid characters delivering inane dialogue fitting snuggly into preposterous plot this is the kind of movie that has one character inserting another character into car headfirst to the floor only because well it supposed to be funny see you see that person then has their legs swinging in the other person face as they drive and that distracts the driver see and well that kinda funny no harumph yeah well you get the picture anyhoo freddie prinze jr nuff said monica potter bad career move but we might forgive you if you keep up the julia roberts bit the rest of the model girls well thanks for being there so had something to look at but please apologize to the entire modeling community as whole for making them all out to be complete imbeciles so why the three points out of ten you may ask well it simple really one point goes to the russian model girl and that cool accent don ask me why but it actually turned me on one point goes out to all of the model girls for being in the movie nice window decoration natch and one last point goes out to the makers of this film who spared us any long sorted story and made sure to give us the opportunity of leaving the theatre after only 90 minutes of manufactured garbage so that we could run out as fast as we can grab the next person that we see walking down the street and warn them of the devil that is freddie prinze jr mean head over heels you ve been warned good people ps didja notice how didn even mention rear window once in my entire review didn want to taint the memory of the classic flick by having it uttered alongside this thing but then again just did mention it but guess it doesn count in the ps section or does it ooooh whatever have headache think my brain is coming back to life where joblo coming from 10 things hate about you 10 coyote ugly 10 down to you 10 save the last dance 10 she all that 10 the wedding planner 10 you ve got mail 10
this talky terribly plotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux an ex new orleans cop who gets ensnared in murder mystery after light plane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat he and his wife annie kelly lynch rescue little salvadorian girl samantha lagpacan from the wreckage and that when the trouble begins the other major players include local drug lord eric roberts his scheming wife teri hatcher soused stripper mary stuart masterson and shady dea agent vondie curtis hall everyone knows everyone else and it makes for collective that curious but never compelling based on the book by james lee burke heaven prisoners is so badly plotted that entire scenes seem to be missing early on we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa later dave is reunited with drug abuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation huh the whole movie is like this perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf whatever the reason somebody should tell director phil joanou final analysis to recut this mess in its present form heaven prisoners runs only two hours plus change but it feels like four
depending on your degree of cinematic acumen last man standing is either prohibition era remake of akira kurosawa 1961 classic yojimbo prohibition era remake of sergio leone 1964 classic fistful of dollars prohibition era action drama with completely original story line new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category than in the other two combined much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself this time around the man with no name is played by bruce willis fellow with shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico by all appearances jericho is well on its way to becoming ghost town with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border one is headed by an irishman named doyle david patrick kelly the other is run by chicago connected italian mobster strozzi ned eisenberg calling himself john smith the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle side but smith allegiance is as uncertain as his name and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from plotting standpoint and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes cum bastardizations there is the happily ineffectual lawman bruce dern the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses affections karina lombard the barkeep who becomes our anti hero only friend william sanderson suspicious lieutenants christopher walken and michael imperioli to question the bosses trust in smith brutal beating and big fire director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids including pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity but at least he doesn try to turn the story into slasher film or buddy picture what he _does_ do is nearly as big mistake and that is to provide running voice over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard boiled style of pulp detective fiction yes that narration is full of cliches but those are are not particularly troubling the problem is that both yojimbo and fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters they were mystery to the other characters in the film and to the audience their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status with john smith voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought he becomes more mundane just another tough guy trying to stay alive it feels like hammett novel all right and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice but it simply doesn work the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence even if you walk into last man standing as blank slate can imagine it being much more than heavily armed minor distraction willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith but there is still level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else christopher walken plays doyle brutal henchman as slight variation on his gallery of soft spoken psychos and there isn another single character whom makes even the slightest impression with no compelling antagonist for smith there is no build up towards the expected showdown and when it does come that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about cinematographer lloyd ahern who also did the only noteworthy work on hill 1995 flop wild bill creates some nifty sunburned vistas but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter productive narration sometimes when someone sees lackluster remake of revered original they ll wonder what all the talk was about in the case of last man standing it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about
my inner flag was at half mast last year when nick at nite pulled dragnet reruns off the air sure seen them all at least once but could always count on at least few inadvertent laughs from ultra serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv even though dragnet is out of circulation at the moment we webb anti fans still have the 50 propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous mavi boy episode of dragnet for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb rapid fire speeches and straight faced seriousness think of the as what would happen if sgt joe friday ever enlisted because he plays exactly the same character here no nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long winded melodramatic speeches on any topic in this election year more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb office door and enters he gives each one different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up the produced and directed by jack webb card pretty much goes without saying this is his movie all the way and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason was wondering if there would even be plot certainly would have been entertained by an hour and half of trademark webb rants but the gives us more much more webb mission is to make man out of private owens the local screw up the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or the captain will personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself whether the lace panties part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered this of course gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens life living hell for those of you who haven been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching here reprint of typical monologue of his can duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper but the words should at least partially convey what talking about now you listen to me youngster someday you ll wake up fighting on beach and you ll pray to god somebody doesn get killed because of your foolishness ve got headline for you every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours you re gonna turn around and ll be standing right there couldn write down all the reprintable dialogue from the nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame but tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines like one from the scene where webb unwinds from hard day work by going to the local bar where he orders tomato juice he meets woman who coincidentally also orders tomato juice but walks away from typically stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch rival another marine webb marches over to the table gets up in her face and says just what kind of dame do you think you are bogart he ain the other gets one of the few memorable non webb lines when he confesses to the girl he damn good guess just little jealous join the club we re all jealous of jack webb way with women which is showcased even more amusingly in later scene as webb finds his way to the woman place of employment lingerie store and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display you expect me to talk to you in _here_ he exclaims no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras the woman goes off to help customer leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen little girl spots him in the store and demands what are you doing in here you re man aren you he doesn reply but you know he thinking in his head what an odd species of human so small must be one of those children everyone been talking about this poor girl scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb would later swear off the male gender entirely just one of the many lesbian conversions he responsible for the movie doesn focus too closely on webb romance it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for flea owens killed during one of their drills after two privates hatch scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea webb asks owens was that flea you killed male or female owens replies male sir webb yells to the platoon this ain the one that such scene along with the rest of the movie was intended to be taken seriously defies comment but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the but for iwo jima guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie with the exception of owens were played by actual marines someone wanting to parody this movie couldn do more comical job than webb did it makes it all the more ironic like raeeyain on your wedding day that the man had no sense of humor himself there scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter webb bursts in the room and shouts what did tell you about laughing to which the private replies sir only nine year old girls laugh sir and let me tell you was as happy as nine year old girl while watching this movie
ah and 1999 was going along so well too she all that has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie ve seen so far this year and quite frankly doubt ll see anything equally bad at least hope don see anything equally bad she all that tells the story of the most popular guy in school played by freddie prinze jr who accepts bet to transform the geekiest girl in school rachel leigh cook into the most popular that right there is problem #1 how many times have we seen this storyline as cook comments near the end of the film it kind of like pretty woman except without the prostitution of course had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material the well worn storyline would have been device to propell the movie forward as it is though she all that relies completely on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead there not one original or interesting character in the film either and if that wasn bad enough there not one good performance featured the star of the movie rachel leigh cook is simply horrible usually don like to get so personal but in this case think it needs to be said cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable time as was was never convinced that she was nerd and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary the movie seems to be saying it better to be popular than to be who you are as for freddie prinze jr an actor ordinarily enjoy he too is quite bad here he coasts through the film on so called charm and never establishes real character kieren culkin is here too as the brother of cook and for some indiscernable reason he got hearing aids no explanation is given and they re never brought up were we supposed to feel sorry for him just because he wore hearing aids don think so that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things ve seen in movie in long time she all that sucks that what it boils down to it not entertaining and it not even good time passer the hour and half running time goes by slower than minute hair removal system informercial and what worse it sends out bad message to teens it appears to be telling them hey it doesn matter if you re happy the way you are that unimportant if you want to truly be happy dress in the latest fashions and act like bubble headed moron ugh
it sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it such is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film _the last samurai_ though the blurb alludes to jungle filled with political intrigue uneasy alliances and murderous enemies at every turn the story of the movie is actually quite simple and prosaic middle aged japanese businessman named endo played by john fujioka and his assistant both of whom have samurai aspirations travel to africa in search of his ancestor who went to bring buddhism to africa he hires the services of down at the heels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo the redoubtable lance henriksen and his girlfriend arabella holzbog and travels to the camp of an arms merchant cum safari host cum islamic missionary john saxon and his wife lisa eilbacher they are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witch doctor aspirations to conceal pre arranged arms deal which subsequently falls through congo escapes finds endo ancestor sword and comes back guns blazing to free the rest of them and endo kills the revolutionary with the sword the end _the last samurai_ is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoyable it is merely _there_ the murky plot is filled with subtexts that are never elaborated subplots that are never explained and many scenes that make very little sense at all the film is shot through with all the tired old inscrutable japanese samurai and zen stereotypes that are to be expected from an american movie it is quite slow paced with only bit of action near the end and the final duel between endo and the terrorist is quite anticlimactic most of the acting is fair with the possible exception of congo girlfriend lance henriksen is his usual scene chewing self and is one of few possible reasons anyone might conceivably have for seeing this movie the only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery paid $3 for this film from the discount rack at best buy and halfway suspect overpaid for it if you are in the mood for samurai read clavell novel or watch kurusawa movie skip _the last samurai_ unless you are die hard henriksen fan
starring william baldwin cindy crawford steven berkoff all right the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role not that cindy does that bad it just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy extraordinary acting skills but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty but sure that that is just coincidence no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet well that just happy coincidence sure william baldwin isn bad actor unfortunately he just doesn demonstrate it at all in this movie not sure if that because most of his lines were just so hokey or if he was trying to make cindy acting look good if it was the latter it worked cindy does surprisingly good job here in her first movie which is not to say that she doesn have room for improvement although to be fair to cindy her lines were kinda cheesy in places so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet chose for her foray into the world of cinema well glad you asked that question cindy plays lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes target for former elite kgb agents why woud they target someone as likable as cindy you ask by the end of the movie you won care the story is so contrived it isn funny anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house without getting so much as scratch might add she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin who character max kilpatric police detective seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal early films the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin characters of the run from these killer russians isn all that bad of an idea it just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes if was baldwin hope this film disappears as for crawford she may indeed have some acting ability unfortunately any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks it too bad they hadn spent more time on half decent plot since ms crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much unless you are huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is movie that will only disappoint you
perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with this is the fake news norm macdonald at times could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi offensive phrases in his raspy voice coated with condescending attitude his shtick was marked by crassness in this movie for example when his girlfriend says that she kicking him out because he been fired from 14 different jobs over the last months he tries to calm the situation by saying maybe you ll feel better after we have some dirty sex this kind of humor can only go so far but certainly can go the distance in full length feature dirty work is nothing more than sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically emotionally they ve never outgrown their pubescent years which is somewhat amusingly explored in beginning flashback although having no apparent real world skills the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people if the meter maid was unjust in giving you ticket then dump bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart mitch norm macdonald and sam artie lange need to come up with $50 000 in period of two weeks so that sam dad jack warden can have heart operation their idea is to start revenge for hire business where they ll do your dirty work in the funniest scene and possibly the only funny scene of the movie they take advantage of live television shoot at nearby used car lot their presence is established but when less than honorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge by default dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots but it delivers jerky boys level material except for the bit at the used car lot and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as prank phone call already weak on material it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs broads and also includes very unfunny chevy chase as bumbling doctor with gambling addiction but what really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying note to self note to self learn to fight he says after getting beat up note to self there always beer he says after hitting rock bottom etc we feel like we re just watching an elongated rehash of his not so glorious days on saturday night live much like the television show for 90 minutes we get one or two funny bits the rest of the story is just dead space
and just when you thought joblo was getting little soft around the corners not rating anything lower than your standard this movie sucks along comes this cinematic atrocity and he forced to take out his secret weapon and spray it with stench so thick even the bravest movie goer would think twice about seeing this waste of time yes despite being third sequel to successful original movie the latest highlander doesn seem to have anything going for it oh stinky movie let me count thee ways plot from what understood really bad highlander dude comes to the present looking to whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain their power and become the mightiest immortal or something along those lines critique complete and utter mess disjointed incoherent boring corny filled with bad dialogue and that just the first thirty minutes this film doesn seem to know what to do with itself it confusing to anyone who doesn know the series include myself in that group and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series include die hard highlander fan the arrow in that group the film doesn explain anything about itself it just goes from one inexplicable situation to another one moment they re in the present time the next moment they re in italy in the 1600s why who knows what are they talking about no idea flashbacks mixed in with the present mixed in with few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now and again and even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene hullo confused yet was and basically stopped giving crap about anyone in the film when realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of story random swordplay mad max like dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 1800s or were they in the present at that time who knows and to be honest who seriously cares this series should have been shot in the head and put out of its own misery long time ago but sadly someone at the studio decided that it still had little life left in it please please for the love of god and all that is holy in the world of movie making and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film put this series to bed and end it even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one the director also tries to do the best he can with the muddled material but all he could come up with is plenty of slo mo action some fast motion fight scenes and lots of smoke everywhere and is there anything spectacular about the sword play or fight scenes nope and think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face close ups yipes the man is not aging gracefully is he oh boy and haven even gotten around to the greatest piece of over acting that ve seen in years the man who plays kell in this movie bruce payne should get ham trophy for literally chewing up every piece of scenery that he gets near overacting is not hobby for this guy it living he also very funny not purposely though all in all the movie stinks nuff said
in times of crisis people are driven to desperate measures of course what constitutes crisis differs from person to person what may be disastrous situation for one may be seen as challenge to another as deepak chopra is known to say it not the ride it the rider unfortunately clear thinking is not always the reaction to problems wall street wheeler dealer steven taylor michael douglas is man with troubles he sunk his money in illegal financial activities and it blown up in his face in matter of days he will lose it all his wife emily gwyneth paltrow is highly placed un interpreter and is not happy with her life either her marriage is cold and unfulfilling unknown to her her new lover david shaw viggo mortensen is not only painter but an ex con with history of bilking wealthy women of their money emily is prime target she worth over $100 million steven solution to his predicament is to offer david half million to kill his wife the artist accepts and the movie is underway drawing from frederick knott play and loosely based on hitchcock dial for murder this is all too typical of summer releases all style and no substance and there really not much style director andrew davis the accomplished witness and best forgotten other films has made exactly the wrong choices at almost every turn douglas and paltrow have both shown us that they are skillful actors in previous films mortensen showed promise in the past here all three are walking uninterestingly through their roles with oddly waxen faces the only person who shows any sense of life is david suchet as new york detective mohamed karaman he only on screen long enough to make you think that there might be likable person in the film and then he disappears the first concern of suspense film is to create suspense surprises are important in this movie the audience keeps waiting for something to happen and nothing ever does nearly every event is telegraphed in advance close up on this object or that action and it easy to guess what going to happen as the film plods towards its inevitable conclusion you keep expecting plot twist to make the movie worthwhile it hopeless quest the story doesn make much sense steven wife is loaded even with unfriendly relations you think that he could have talked to her about his difficulty rather than deciding to kill her when he does decide on the dire plan he makes an unreasonable choice if you were going to hire someone to kill your wife would your first choice be her lover no matter how sleazy he is would think there might be chance that he would turn down the opportunity why would steven plan the murder as break in in their apartment why not just take her out as she was walking to david loft in bad neighborhood while deciding among the numerous summer films you might do well to skip this one you ll find more suspense than this movie offers by watching the weather channel
