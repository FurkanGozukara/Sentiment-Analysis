one of my colleagues was surprised when told her was willing to see betsy wedding and she was shocked to hear that actually liked it her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald who hasn made worthwhile film since 1986 but the fact is betsy wedding is also an alan alda film and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects including crimes and misdemeanors and new life written and directed by alda betsy wedding is vibrant slice of life mixing few dramatic moments into big bowl of whimsical humor alda comic elixir is smooth and refreshing and welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare as bride and groom molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film but they are by far the least interesting walsh is nonentity with all the screen presence of door knob ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain she looks hideous with her short cropped orange hair kirmizi lip stick and grotesque outfits she supposed to be dress designer but she looks more like clown and to make matters worse ringwald performance matches her appearance thankfully alda keeps ringwald screen time to minimum he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters the wedding is just device to bring together the bride working class italian family and the groom rich gentile family ringwald folks are homey and down to earth with alda as her free spirited father madeline kahn as her practical mother and ally sheedy as her lonely sister walsh clan on the other hand is prim proper and ostentatious when the two families meet and mingle the movie becomes story of culture clash or as one character puts it money versus values ally sheedy in wonderfully understated performance is one of the film most pleasant surprises sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body it anthony lapaglia however who seizes the spotlight lapaglia plays stevie dee suave overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old fashioned chivalry lapaglia sincere but dim witted character is riot and what uncanny is that lapaglia is dead ringer for robert de niro with little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting and his inspired performance is partly tribute to his role model and partly rip off don know whether to say star is born or star is re born but do know that lapaglia over the top performance should not be missed the scrumptious comic acting however extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia joe pesci in particular sinks his teeth into his role as alda unscrupulous brother in law slum lord with mob ties who is cheating on his wife catherine hara alda faced with challenge of both directing and acting somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride financially strapped father carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet the film adopts alda psychological point of view as he tries to one plan the wedding and two pay for it as filmmaker alda style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful and while he doesn have the comic genius of woody allen alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy
linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction and her being cast as dogma lead is nothing short of inexplicable she still in fine form as bethany an abortion clinic worker who lost her faith one night visitor from heaven makes fiery entrance in bethany bedroom he is metatron alan rickman the voice of god and he needs her help she must stop two fallen angels from entering new jersey church the fate of the universe depends on it god would do it him herself but he she is missing having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the prophets jay jason mewes and silent bob kevin smith doing double duty the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith films thus far at some point rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus the undocumented and very siyah thirteenth apostle and offers his assistance as does divine stripper serendipity salma hayek it wild ride they re in pursuit of loki and bartleby damon and affleck respectively this is probably the sharpest either has ever been who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered dogmatic loophole that will enable their return loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates at one point he terrorizes boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets it nasty guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks how corrupt are you wings of desire this ain since debuting with clerks smith has grown as director particularly in terms of working with actors chris rock is this film only weak link between jokes he wooden his no frills visual style hasn changed much over the years though dogma widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations nor has his writing his characters still sit around delivering one caustic hilarious speech after another dogma chips away at big religious issues namely the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs eloquently and articulately but few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition as well the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever any movie with this much weighty talk would have hard time maintaining momentum hurlyburly anyone and eventually dogma pacing goes slack long diatribe from bartleby late in the game in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings comes at point when we ve heard enough because his change of heart bartleby is initially the good cop to loki bad drives the climax said rant is given great deal of screen time sure affleck deserved big moment damon steals their scenes together prior but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated like tarantino smith was video age sponge who became sample mad indie filmmaker dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies including indiana jones and the last crusade with silent bob doing his best harrison ford and weird science shit demon attacks our heroes smith also has kitchen sink brand of humour his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount publicity campaign with the slogan catholicism wow and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished bust ed gut on several occasions proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever it disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease for to read it one actually has to see dogma the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ martin scorsese 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis controversial novel in that it is not directly linked to the picture content but to rumours and heresy there famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into screening on his dime just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against not one of them had watched it every single person refused smith and scorsese have lot in common and so do the two films in question because both smith bethany and scorsese jesus are hollow shells without their faith in fact dogma denouement which follows thrilling showdown that worth the wait is catholic love in veritable recruitment poster felt sentimental about religion don belong to now that powerful filmmaking smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god and that spirituality shines through it enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins my religion is movies when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against doctrine in roundabout way they re attacking what live for freedom of expression through celluloid therefore feel that although no bible thumper at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers
will hunting matt damon is natural genius for movie character that usually death sentence it trait associated with what my brother calls too good for this world movies like phenomenon or powder forgive me for spoiling the ending but will doesn die this is no formula movie in fact it quite fresh and original it character study more than anything and that not surprising considering it was written by two actors damon and co star ben affleck will works whatever kind of job he can get first he janitor then he works construction off screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him on screen he hangs out with his friends picking fights in robust romanticized hemingway fashion lambeau stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves math professor learns that the janitor will is genius with special talent for advanced mathematics having confirmed he not fluke or savant he does what he can to get will into the education system he is firmly rejected finally will lands in jail for one of his fights lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him will barely decides to go for the therapy over prison lambeau treats will like son he proud of and amazed by will accomplishments in mathematics he encourages will and tries to give him structure knowing that with little discipline he could be bigger than einstein will isn really interested in academia he knows he would be the best in his field and therefore spend all of his time in an office explaining math to people like lambeau he would rather work construction which breaks lambeau heart meanwhile will attends his mandated therapy sessions it not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau list will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade and how to keep them from affecting him shrink after shrink refuses to return after will mockery lambeau last hope is his old college roommate now psychology teacher at small time community college knowing that will is going to try to shred him too sean robin williams agrees to take him on as favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein true to form will finds sean emotional weakness and attacks but unlike the other shrinks sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions like foster mother with fussy child sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride like the foster mother sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach robin williams is excellent in this role he not an actor with great range but in the right roles he has great depth in this movie as in awakenings there comes point when the quiet shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance and smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes williams is the only actor can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling have compared will to foster child and that not entirely fair emotionally he has lot to learn but he is not child he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants sean his girlfriend his pals and lambeau all help him grow but he didn start out asking for or particularly needing help his exceptional gift singled him out and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction if had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama it too sentimental and uplifiting for straight drama but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama it is emotionally engaging but it not quite larger than life this isn problem per se but at times didn know quite how to take it but this is relatively small complaint about very good movie good movie allows its characters to learn and grow it doesn just happen it takes good script good acting and good direction good will hunting has all three if you are at all inclined to see it by all means go

synopsis leonard shelby pearce is former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife leonard has only few clues to the murderer identity to make matters worse he suffers from condition which inhibits the creation of short term memories meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier because of this leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself memento traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination review memento is the sort of movie wish written can think of no higher praise than that am envious that nolan has concocted such brilliant involved original movie as this an instant film noir classic memento is virtually flawless the script is unlike any have ever seen notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity although the idea of starting at the conclusion of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the start is not entirely new never before have witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence memento is endlessly exciting and inventive rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre and it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively nolan direction is equally effective never losing its crispness and clarity despite memento challenging gimmick and to top everything off all the performances rise to the occasion pierce is terrific as the troubled leonard moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie and pantoliano teddy achieves splendidly affable yet sinister quality memento may be the year best screenplay and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001
up until about year ago john travolta career consisted of those look who talking movies notice how they never called them look who talented and the 1991 bomb shout which was bad enough to make most people scream but somewhere along the line travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again while barry robin and maurice gibb could do no better than 1993 straight to the cutout bin album aptly named size isn everything and of course they learned that sales are everything but now travolta back on the hollywood scene once again and think we all know why four words contract with the devil and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich contract with america no satan is much more humane anyway yes travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld how do know own the document in question amazing what you can buy at those collector shops for few hundred dollars isn it get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction with travolta as crime minion chili palmer he goes to collect some of the mafia money from grade director gene hackman and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game sure ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood but guess that beside the point palmer is determined to get hackman next project made so he sets out to convince big star martin weir danny devito to star in the movie bringing along down and out horror actress karen flores rene russo who has already had affairs with hackman and devito it doesn take las vegas odds maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well after the customary sexual tension and denial which has been used in every comedy from who the boss to speechless it works in this case unlike who the boss although it interesting to note that tony danza has signed contract with the devil also complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman other films and want in on this one too along with travolta mob boss trying to track him down for defecting get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction despite the obvious similarities this movie doesn have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies ve seen this year yes even better than halloween vi get shorty is my kind of movie one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on are you getting this shorty
there an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy return of the jedi the final installment of the series is easily the most innovative action packed and entertaining of the three films the dark eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone instead for return of the jedi we have good triumphing decisively over evil resolution to love triangle and walking teddy bears even darth vader doesn seem very intimidating this time around with the arrival of the emperor an apparition like creature played by ian mcdiarmid vader has turned into somewhat of henchman return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back luke skywalker mark hamill princess leia carrie fisher lando calrissian billy dee williams chewbacca peter mayhew c3p0 anthony daniels and r2 d2 kenny baker are on rescue mission to luke home planet of tatooine their goal to save han solo harrison ford from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt it is at jabba home creepy looking stone fortress guarded by hog nosed beasts that most of the added special effects come into play from hysterical scene involving music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba sand barge the effects are top notch as soon as han is freed from his cryo freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt it back to outer space where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire newest threat second more powerful death star that if activated could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor so while the fleet prepares for the final battle luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks there they are befriended by the ewoks the teddy bear like native race and luke fearing that his presence is endangering the group turns himself over to vader return of the jedi has some interesting elements the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well acted from technical point of view the space battles are amazing easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films not only are there many many more ships but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved on one level return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects in the special edition even more ships are added making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films by now or then 1983 mark hamill harrison ford and carrie fisher have all matured in their on screen personas the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific as in empire billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as suitably creepy cunning and evil creature although he not as imposing as vader was in star wars although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen return of the jedi generates greater sense of enjoyment with the spectacular new special effects the adorable ewoks the sinister jabba the hutt the evil emperor the same old millenium falcon darth vader incredible betrayal the destruction of the new death star and the always lovable yoda return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with huge bang congratulations to george lucas whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come
you ve seen this moment before recently particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor nell in the haunting we don care the hero of the sixth sense young boy named cole is rich creation and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take hike the seasons have changed since an ex patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe willis in the comfort of his own bedroom desperate to get his career back on track even at the expense of his crumbling marriage to williams of rushmore malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole osment the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm would be killer scars on his body antisocial behaviour and the reluctance to reveal big secret only after cole is locked in closet by some bullies and hospitalized as result does he divulge to malcolm in spine tingling scene that he sees dead people walking among us all the time malcolm assumes and given his profession reasonably so that cole is schizophrenic not psychic but the sincerity in cole anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures he will instead pursue the supernatural angle becoming kind of surrogate father to cole who lives with his single mother lynn collette in the process the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist though shyamalan does somewhat unforgiveably crib the self rearranging kitchen business from the latter it far more heartwarming than frightening and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown but they re not out to harm him really they just want to be heard even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us at first than they really are because we re looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight year old that right willis for the first time in years gives up the spotlight to his costar we appreciate malcolm domestic dilemma but we identify with cole recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed both actors deliver immensely likable performances and their dynamic is manifest willis convinces us that he doctor something he was unable to do as horndog shrink in the overheated color of night osment is phenomenal true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do the sixth sense atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs cinematographer tak fujimoto is actually drama its spooky effective ad campaign is misleading only because was expecting something different did notice rather feel the movie running time which is just shy of two hours the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof but admired its audacity
the long kiss goodnight meryl streep tried it and failed even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well bared assets however geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband renny harlin davis plays samantha caine mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey samuel jackson she slowly remembers and reclaims her past as charly baltimore tough as nails cia operative needless to say with the reappearance of samantha charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no goodniks out to erase more than her memory shane siyah netted cool $4 mil for his script not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such hefty price tag but for what it worth it delivers the goods like black previous work such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny quirky dialogue the humor especially works well in this case for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously but there no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after car while ice skating jackson and davis make good team jackson is funny as ever as ever in fact his spirited line deliveries especially when he first appears are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction as good as he is the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis who shows much promise as an action heroine what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn take herself too seriously she is obviously in on the joke slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation this is not to say that she doesn need work sometimes she lays on the toughness bit too thick and comes off too much as caricature but should the public embrace the film and in turn the notion of kick ass female davis could have found her special niche it seems as if davis and harlin first collaboration the middling pirate epic cutthroat island was just dress rehearsal albeit very costly one for long kiss in which the wife husband team hit their action stride anyone simply looking for fun escapist entertainment that requires little to no thinking will find this film to be more than welcome kiss

is evil dead ii bad movie it full of terrible acting pointless violence and plot holes yet it remains cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots including the original evil dead is extremely difficult `well what it about `five people stranded in log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from variety of ugly hairy wart covered monsters `come on saw movie just like that on monster vision last week why should see it again `no evil dead ii is different it funny `it funny to see people die are you sick or something maybe am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of movie his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle as disturbing as it is hilarious an example of raimi odd approach monster formerly protagonist ash girlfriend of all people is cut in half by chainsaw and tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound sure it over the top but it is so over the top that it is laugh out loud funny just try watching ash with straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood staining his face and knocking him back few feet the whole movie is like this watch ash get beat up watch ash defeat the monster watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets the more amusing it becomes no matter how sick it may sound it is funny to watch bruce ampbell ash get his butt kicked every five minutes and raimi takes advantage he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend by the body of an old lady even by his own right hand like the less superior idle hands we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part but it doesn end ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family all of these events thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster like camera movements at first become shocking then inexplicably funny raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers duck soup then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off with running time of less than an hour and half raimi gets away with the impossible making horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series raimi obviously had lot of fun making this movie and couldn wait to make it sequel
known as the most successful highest grossing romantic comedy in history director garry marshall apparently struck altin with pretty woman which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but thanks to positive word of mouth was able to reach upwards of $175 million in theaters alone the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film two charismatic stars richard gere and julia roberts since the story itself is none too original or even believable the other winning element that makes pretty woman so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence which is rarely as palpable in today films as it is here edward lewis richard gere is suave extremely wealthy business mogul who at the start of the picture breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after nasty argument and abruptly takes his friend car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel stopping the car along the street he asks woman obviously prostitute for directions agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks edward ultimately accepts they strike up conversation and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor this meeting does not lead to sex however as edward confides that he rather just have someone to talk to and offers her $300 to spend the night just as well since the hooker named vivian is beautiful generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned when edward finally offers to pay vivian three thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get togethers since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act edward and vivian will finally truly kiss allegedly planned as grim downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director pretty woman has been transformed in all senses of the word into classic fairy tale la cinderella the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been you honestly don need high iq or any iq for that matter to guess how the film will end and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less than gratifying and the screenplay is no award winner and yet amidst all of these qualms and flaws pretty woman is an astoundingly charming motion picture and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers you actually be amazed how far bemusement can go and there are few select moments not even whole scenes mind you that are as romantic as anything ve seen on film in the 1990 additionally the film belongs and its success can be attributed to two people and two people only and they are richard gere and julia roberts playing sex symbols throughout the 80s with such pictures as american gigolo and an officer and gentleman gere branches out here to play more quiet almost shy but still alluring character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet and vice versa julia roberts in her breakthrough role after 1988 well received mistic pizza and 1989 steel magnolia for which she was nominated for an academy award is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian who surprisingly could be role model for impressionistic viewers not for her line of work but more for her sheer intelligence it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely flake but screenwriter lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such thing after pretty woman roberts along with meg ryan became the reigning queen of romantic comedies with her latest being the just released runaway bride which repairs gere and roberts together once again and no wonder roberts has continually proven to not only be strong actress with flare for comedy but also one who can efficiently do drama and in almost every film she appears in it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co star an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co workers that vivian is actually prostitute and he then approaches her making sexual advances no only does this make vivian feel cheap especially since she had previously been posing as more professional eloquent young lady but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such way and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading and if she likes this particular path on the more dreamy side the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold especially one in which edward enters into the hotel lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress but also her inner and outer glowing beauty another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing kiss to edward who is asleep and placing it on his lips since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in short couple of days pretty woman does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene which is happy ending as you expect and wouldn have it any other way that somehow does not work perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances this one misstep does not put damper on the rest of the film though because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such petty problem helped along by warm memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo as vivian best friend and roommate and fabulously catchy soundtrack in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie overall fulfillment pretty woman is sparkler of motion picture and has what it takes to act as blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy
the long and illustrious career of robin williams which has included both forgettable turns like mrs doubtfire and flubber was punctuated with the actor first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989 dead poets society and critical remarks were unanimously positive his next role that of deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come was unfortunately lackluster and so after six year stint as comedic actor the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams williams is the title character hunter patch adams sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting we re introduced to patch as he commits himself to mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies it at the institution however that he discovers latent talent for relating to people he removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia medical college where he finds that medical doctrine is calculating impersonal trade his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion and the movie climaxes with patch appearance before the state medical board the characters are well defined in an oscar worthy sense although the script does not perform well as narrative there little story to be told outside of patch skit length experiences the script does go long way toward building the relationships of characters at medical school patch meets up with truman schiff daniel london an outsider like himself who relishes patch zest for humanity the two instantly become the best of friends and it easy to see why monica potter plays patch love interest young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school for some reason he attracted to her and although it never gets said the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view the script based on hunter adams own story works well this way the rest of the cast bob gunton as the villain professor in particular is solid director tom shadyac liar liar leads us in and out of patch life in sound intentional manner combined with williams presence on screen the movie rarely becomes boring patch adams lack of purpose is its major shortcoming and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours there little feeling of continuity or the passage of time nevertheless it an emotionally moving picture and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season it succeeds at everything it tries and only fails at the stuff it doesn try in the first place by and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams but more importantly it entertainment for the entire family

with his last two films shine and snow falling on cedars australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there and his latest hearts in atlantis is no different its structure beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle is similar to the green mile which is bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books the parallels don end there either atlantis was adapted by william goldman who had previously penned the big screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king dreamcatcher even the film content is bit reminiscent of mile in fact it the perfect blend of the feel good 60s nostalgia of stand by me also by king and mystical power hokum of mile king atlantis is book comprised of five related short stories but the main focus here is on the first and longest tale called low men in yellow coats the film title comes from the second chapter it set in 1960 harwich connecticut where 11 year old bobby garfield anton yelchin lives in boarding house run by his cold self centered mother elizabeth hope davis joe gould secret who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son bobby spends his time with his two closest friends john sullivan will rothhaar and tomboy carol gerber mika boorem who become something like the kevin paul and winnie of harwich when new tenant moves into the vacant room the fatherless bobby finds male role model in ted brautigan anthony hopkins hannibal mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature after his cheapskate mother gives him library card for his birthday dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers won go into what these powers are but they re considerably toned down from the book and don involve siyah stuff flying out of ted mouth la mile atlantis present day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel final chapter titled heavenly shades of night are falling and features david morse in yet another connection to the green mile as married middle aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks cedars which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski the oscar nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski kirmizi the acting is solid from everyone including hopkins who never once makes you think of dr lecter most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem who both had tiny parts in along came spider while didn really have much of problem with goldman screenplay do need to point out at least one inconsistency goldman for those of you who don read premiere writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else films carefully explaining why they all suck make no sense and insult their audiences while somehow failing to mention the crap that he penned like the general daughter it mean spirited but fun to read mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business including michael jackson and robert blake in atlantis which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back well he not and it doesn make sense 41 pg 13 for violence and thematic elements

must admit going to be bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity because that also defines how met my current girlfriend the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity am not big fan of the romantic comedy genre but something drew me to this film maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in supporting role and the hilarious eugene levy maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity con air and pushing tin but maybe it was because feel as giddy as school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life the story of serendipity is simple two people john trager john cusack and sara thomas kate beckinsale looking ever so hot have chance encounter over pair of gloves with buck henry smack dab in the middle charmed beyond repair these two knuckleheads grab sundae together at caf called serendipity talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down and spend few hours at the local ice skating rink but with each of them already involved with other parties sara has john write his name and number on $5 bill and she writes her name and number on copy of love in the time of cholera sara declares that if this thing let just call it love is destined to happen fate will bring them together in the future years later and on opposite coasts of america john and sara both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts what happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat and mouse game with the fates involving such items as mistaken identity graduate homage john corbett as freaky new age musician and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman to find out if that thing was right after all fortunately first time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong well rounded characters to propel predictable and corny narrative coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones and the use of time lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity both piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters on the flipside films such as you ve got mail made in heaven and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film main journey at hand but it what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture
he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother she inspires his love and his fear and instills in him similar love and fear of jesus he has rudimentary grasp of language mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother phrases he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous his mother dons gasmask whenever she goes out the door he is 35 years old in body but child in mind and spirit he is the premise for bad boy bubby defiantly original australian movie about man called bubby nicholas hope who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment etc etc then one day his father ralph cotterill appears his father is shabby down at heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion unsurprisingly he is not thrilled with the way his boy has turned out he is however rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother claire benito and more to the point her ample breasts soon they are copulating on the dingy couch while bubby crouches confused in the next room acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has new interest bubby relationship to the world may be warped but it is at least stable the father arrival disturbs his precarious balance causing an oedipal conflict which ends freud would be pleased in violence and as result freedom bubby intuits from his father arrival that the air outside is breathable he leaves the apartment his past his world behind so far so good the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby which bring us to this point are quite brilliant the movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby hermetic two room universe it follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise bubby is used by his mother for sex he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins it is grim and savage and appalling but also strangely tender de heer having imagined life as bizarre as bubby does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes but simply empathizes he observes what it might be like the intensity of these opening scenes with their minimalist mise en scene immerses us in claustrophobic environment which seems to be decayed stratum of our own world and owes much to david lynch eraserhead not least the ambient industrial beyaz noise of the soundtrack for thirty minutes the movie maintains the feel and mood of reality that does not seem far removed from our own then de heer lets bubby out brings him into contact with our world and the film never quite recovers our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide where he wanders the streets and meets people where he suffers and learns and survives he is seduced by young woman from salvation army band how an anti social half wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages wisely he is given free pizza by sympathetic waitress he insults traffic cop and is punched in the stomach he shares few beers in the back of truck with rock group he is imprisoned and raped he becomes translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension he is loved by motherly large breasted nurse carmel johnson it goes on by turns inventive silly tasteless endearing and sometimes all of these things at once de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world the tone shifts uneasily from fable to realism to satire and back again the scenes which try to touch base with believable version of reality are the weakest the film is best understood as kind of parable and indeed the religious implications of bubby experiences are foregrounded icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother walls bubby dons priest collar stolen from his father church organ playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief the woman who redeems him is named angel the manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby mind do not fragment him into psychosis rather the world accomodates him and heals him although de heer touch is at times overbearing bubby salvation is touching what seemd at first harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes na ve humanist tale of improbable hope hapless rock group write song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community he returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art and turning the band into popular draw innocence triumphs bubby becomes holy fool an idiot savant and graces us with wisdom it strange turn of events but by now we shouldn be surprised because bad boy bubby ain like other movies
the submarine genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is think about it these films are completely based in reality yet only handful of people have ever been on one making them fascinating to the general public they aren like movies that take place on plane or train as anybody can get on one of those and they aren like movies that happen in outer space either because no one done any of that stuff yet when new one comes out you don hear anyone say ugh another submarine movie like people tend to say ugh another boxing movie look at modern movies that involve submarines das boot the abyss the hunt for kirmizi october crimson tide all are well regarded as top notch entertainment gladly joining that bunch is 571 which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of naval submarine during world war ii we learn he has been denied recommendation for his own command by his superior bill paxton mcconaughey crew then receives orders that they will be boarding disabled german submarine to steal the enigma german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence the mission goes horribly wrong however and as result mcconaughey and only handful of his crew as well as captured german become trapped aboard the 571 in enemy waters the first great thing about 571 is the film opening sequence the german crew of 571 are under attack which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion it tense exciting and fascinating and applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles most movies with scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away once the plot gets moving 571 gives us action sequence after action sequence making the audience wonder ok now how do they get out of this the stakes keep raising much like in executive decision an excellent action thriller and even though the audience knows how the film will end it lot of fun getting there only have two minor complaints about the entire film the first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence while their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going which they do feel as though it could have been done much quicker and less conventionally mean did we really have to see the ship crew at wedding because of that you now know exactly what going to happen to the groom my other gripe would be during the film finale there an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one cannot stress this enough until cgi effect can be made to look like model effect stick with using models yes 571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard submarine will tell you that couldn happen but the overall point of this film is entertainment it succeeds fantastically [pg 13]
well ll admit when first heard about this film which was before dante peak could just smell what twister had started so now it seems that we re in full fledged return to the 70 disaster film era with twister dante peak volcano and soon flood and james cameron extremly expensive titanic ll say first off enjoyed volcano much more than did dantes peak part of that is just being biased as usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in ve been reading lot about the movie being cheezy or hokey and really didn see or think that once during the entire film get bored easily and this film didn bore me for minute another thing and boy am bitching today that bothers me is when critics and such go on about well thats not really possible you know what couldn give bloody damn if it possible or not really couldn it freaking movie and don want reality thrown in my face want to be able to see the impossible the all might what if to many reviewers have seen one to many movies the special effects are the second star to this feature they are so amazing that found it hard sometimes to believe they were indeed fx and la was was not burning to the ground they did an incredible job and come oscar time if they remember some notice better be thrown there way
seen september 13 1998 at at rotterdam square mall cinema theater #2 with chris wessell for free using my sony loews critic pass [theater rating good seats average sound picture unstable] rounders is exactly the kind of movie parents don want their kids to see it not that it drunken orgy of sex and violence but because it film that flat out says you can make career out of gambling and to take make things worse it proves this through its original fascinating story there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the noir mood that is the dark shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life this film starts off in the tradiational noir style introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing matt damon stars as mike mcdermott 20 something law student in present day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played damon narrates throughout the film but the entire opening scene is voiced over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting mike about to go up against teddy kgb malkovich russian gangster who looks like serial killer but then again he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense the look in his eyes his slow movements his intricate mannerisms all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld literally damon in the flesh might seem little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly groomed features but his narration is what brings it all together he never sounds like he reading from script nor that he trying to embellish anything it just comes natural to him the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood from the smell of the air to the logic involved in reading the other guys faces and cards and all without sounding remotely trite immediately we get the sense that poker isn for gamblers but for near geniuses with nerves of steel the game is quiet war with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car but when it comes to the game of poker all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble bit we learn only little about mike both past and present presently we know he has girlfriend named jo gretchen mol who he constantly argues with over his gambling they go through few break up make up cycles until mike childhood pal and fellow rounder worm norton is released from prison it not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such predictable element and execute it the way it does technically the plot isn unlike many children sitcoms in which the good kid bad friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid what this film does is use different medium to tell that story mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives but both share passion for out thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating hence his jail time mike always takes the cards he dealt and works with them sometimes they pay off his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money but other times they don the fact he takes himself out of the game and works steady job after dropping $30 000 on single hand once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places from socialites mansions to taking the tourists at atlantic city to outwitting the gangsters that control it all everything they come into contact with is big poker game in that everything battle against the cards destiny deals one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by judge martin landou in perfectly cast and performed role that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time matt good at gambling but he also got potential to be great lawyer he could go professional as either but with one he could lose everything or win big but with the other there stability but not much risk involved can someone who gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave if the film had been just subtle lesson in poker playing then the ending is our test everything is told from mike perspective but we re finally able to recognize some things on our own this makes the final against all odds showdown seem like just that it works just like the game it revolves around showing us some of the cards but still evokes the element of the unknown and the consequences thereof what separates rounders from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end
most sequels don do what they re supposed to do like toy story does far too many of them end up re hashing the original and adding very little is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors thankfully toy story is wonderful exception can remember the last time saw sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one it yet another sign that pixar the acclaimed animation studio behind toy story and bug life is still at the top of its game woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit toy story and things have changed bit since the last one ended woody voiced by tom hanks is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp in his absence he has assigned buzz lightyear tim allen now comfortable in his role as toy to take charge unfortunately woody trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale and is stolen by an over zealous toy collector wayne knight off to save him are buzz and members of the old toy gang including mr potato head don rickles rex the nervous dinosaur wallace shawn hamm the piggy bank john ratzenberger and slinky dog jim varney while in captivity woody makes startling discovery he is actually part of collection of toys based on 1950 children show entitled woody roundup he meets the show other characters which include jesse joan cusack his cowgirl sidekick the wise old prospector kelsey grammer and bullseye his trusty horse they have all been anxiously awaiting woody arrival as once their set is completed they will be sold to japanese toy museum and finally escape storage forever this means woody now faces difficult choice with his friends coming to rescue him does he go with them and spend few more years with andy or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever as in the original film toy story contains first rate animation and pixar studios has done remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there reportedly the film was originally slated for direct to video release but after seeing the improvements that had been made disney rightly decided to release it into theaters the film is well worth seeing on the big screen the colors are bright the textures sharp and even the human characters look more human the animation is consistently seamless with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable there are so many impressive sequences that find it impossible to list them here but was particularly wowed by scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across busy intersection to get to al toy barn the store owned by woody captor pixar rendition of the family dog is also nicely done with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it the voice work is also perfectly complementary and as with the first movie does much to help further character development tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz making you forget who is doing the voice it was woody and buzz up there not tom and tim all the cast members from the original reprise their roles and each is excellent several new voices have been added with joan cusack kelsey grammer and wayne knight doing fine work toy story is strong in characterization and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie woody faces difficult choices while buzz is confronted with new buzz who hasn yet realized his status as toy forcing him to see what he used to be like the new characters are also developed quite well especially jesse who narrates sarah mclachlan aided flashback illustrating how she was loved then forgotten by her owner it may be computer animated and it may have sappy music but it downright touching the script despite having story and screenplay each credited to four different writers is endlessly clever and inventive especially considering that it sequel the reason toy story works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original success by re doing the same story and using the same characters not this one we get character change new characters and new issues brought up toy story is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here the humor is sharp and witty with something to amuse both kids and adults there are funny asides to films such as star wars and jurassic park among others new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock em sock em robots and appearances from other pixar efforts bug life and the 1997 short geri game geri himself makes an appearance as toy repairman who fixes woody broken arm the action is fast and furious and the chases in the street in toy store in an elevator on baggage carousel and in an airplane keep getting bigger and better toy story never grows stagnant because there is always something new to hold your interest the more you pay attention to it the more rewarding it is it rare to see film like toy story come along because it the kind of film that almost impossible to dislike it created purely to entertain and though enjoy thought provoking drama as much as the next person it nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do send us out with smile it fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing toy story it the rare sequel that manages to expand on and live up to the original
in essence good will hunting is an ordinary story told well taken as whole there little that special about this tale it follows traditional narrative path leaves the audience with warm fuzzy feeling and never really challenges or surprises us but it intelligently written with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant strongly directed and nicely acted so while good will hunting is far from late year masterpiece it worthwhile sample of entertainment like scent of woman which was released around this time of the season five years ago good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between world weary veteran and cocky young man the formula for the two films is similar both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to better understanding of life and their place in it but the characters are different al pacino slade was larger than life individual robin williams sean mcguire is much more subtle and matt damon will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris donnell charlie will is troubled individual as child he was the frequent victim of abuse an orphan he was in and out of foster homes on regular basis now not yet 21 years old he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet he has short temper and any little incident can set him off like spark in tinder box but he mathematical genius with photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems while working as janitor at mit he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building hall blackboards then one evening his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau stellan skarsgard catches him at work will flees but lambeau tracks him down unfortunately by the time the professor finds him will is in jail for assaulting police offer the judge agrees to release will under two conditions that he spend one day week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day week meeting with therapist eventually once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man sean mcguire teacher at bunker hill community college agrees to take the case after rocky start the two form rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor and as will advances his self awareness in sessions with sean he also learns about friendship from his buddy chuckie ben affleck and love from harvard co ed named skylar minnie driver the script by co stars matt damon and ben affleck is not groundbreaking piece of literature and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation the characters are well developed however and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles at one point will comments that session with sean is turning into taster choice moment later will gives brilliant breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith note since smith co executive produced good will hunting it not out of the question that he had some input into this scene director gus van sant drugstore cowboy to die for culls genuine emotion from his actors and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes there an edginess to some of the sean will therapy sessions and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver who became romantically linked while making this film translates effectively to the movie the will skylar relationship is electric likewise the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie friendship many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting recommendation even if the overall story is somewhat generic matt damon who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker is solid although not spectacular as will minnie driver last seen in grosse pointe blank adds another strong performance to growing resume and it refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams whose sean is sad and wise funny and somber arguably the best dramatic work in the actor career alongside what he did in the fisher king williams portrayal could earn him best supporting actor oscar nomination adequate support is provided by ben affleck chasing amy and stellan skarsgard breaking the waves like most of what comes before it the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable but meeting expectations and following familiar path aren always bad things in movie provided the film accomplishes those goals with modicum of style and an attention to detail good will hunting does both and as result earns rating commensurate with the good in the title
matthew broderick and high school comedy the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986 now it is 13 years later and broderick has another high school comedy election to show the world ferris buehler day off showed an educational setting that was similar to pile of marshmallows it was light fluffy tasty and sparkling clean but election is far different this production is dark and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies it shocks as well jim mcallister matthew broderick is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud he is kind caring younger man who has built his life around carver high school in turn carver high school has provided home for him jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span and is well respected social studies teacher among the student body tracy flick reese witherspoon is an intelligent outgoing and to quote the film super nice young girl she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities always has her hand up first in class and is extremely popular among most of the student body so it is natural progression when she decides to run for school president the metzler family is an extremely wealthy one the father dick holmes osborne owns cement company the mother jo jeanine jackson is an ideal housewife and the two children paul chris klein and tammy jessica campbell are both students at carver high school paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself and is definitely candidate for most popular person in school tammy is lesbian who to say the least is going through period of self discovery for reasons of revenge hatred and sexual envy jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president he claims that in democracy you need choices and having tracy run unopposed creates dictatorship of sorts so paul agrees and the race is on but then in an effort to spite the two candidates tammy announces that she is running as well her campaign is straightforward people only run to put it on their college applications then they do nothing well don even want to go to college she says in election there are no good guys almost everyone has their own agenda no matter how deeply hidden the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school she is the girl that would be labeled most likely to achieve anything she wants in the yearbook and everyone secretly envied her because of that jim is teacher that takes the trust that students give him as privilege and uses it to his own amoral advantage everyone including the principal former teacher all the candidates and even paul girlfriend are two sided characters that is much of this film beauty it doesn have the typical good guys that hollywood likes instead it is realistic portrayal of the real world specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves matthew broderick couldn have been any more perfect for this role his character is often similar bill murray award winning role in the 1998 film rushmore of the two acting jobs broderick is far superior but even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon the hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her is simply indescribable broderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day you can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him list of signatures making her an eligible candidate and his subtle disgust with her is apparent although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on happy face the supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience but that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part however the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as young homosexual girl this is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so called platform for presidency she is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed if ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools and gave you an innocent laugh or two then the movie achieved its goal but don you dare think that election goals are similar it is just as real in its portrayal of high school as its characters are in the real world there certainly is no pile of marshmallows here
if he doesn=92t watch out mel gibson is in danger of being known as someone other than mad max of course there are still few big guns in this film but there=92s some accomplished acting too although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty anti hero skin as his career progresses here he explores new genre the businessman as action hero in ron howard=92s latest film gibson plays tom mullen gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair by kidnappers mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation veteran of numerous hard nosed business negotiations the tycoon realizes that in order to get his son back alive he has to play his hand differently the casting is what puts this film over the top the trio of gibson the kidnappers mastermind gary sinise and fbi team leader delroy lindo play off of each other wonderfully sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark his speech to mullen over walkie talkie about wells=92 morlocks and eloi reveal his vision of= society mullen and the other glitteratti frolic up on high while sinise and the other lowlifes dwell below feeding off the unsuspecting gibson=92s character is an all american hero with few flaws his cowboy= tactics tend to work but they are also what got him into this situation to begin with in round about way if he weren=92t known as man who i= willing to buy his way out of trouble his son wouldn=92t have been kidnapped as sinise says you=92re payer you did it once and now you=92re going to do it again one of the nicest elements of this film is that most of the characters actually have personalities lindo calls home to talk to his kids obviously shaken at working this case even the kidnappers are real people arguing about the ultimate fate of sean mullen and feeding him candy bars gibson=92s break down on the balcony of their penthouse apartment is especially effective it=92s one of the best filmed representations of man=92s world falling apart that i=92ve seen it=92s not all perfect the shoot em upending while emotionally satisfying seems tacked on to be just that rather than to provide powerful resolution as well crafted as the scene is we=92ve seen it before mullen=92s wife rene russo has several good moments but occasionally just seems to be there while adequate brawley nolte sean doesn=92t provide much to the film other than occupying space to build the story around but you=92ll ignore these problems as each minute of the movie builds on the previous one forget about the large coke you won=92t want to leave for that five minute break an hour later
only year after the initial release of scream the horror send up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre the inevitable sequel scream has arrived in our theaters while the tongue in cheek parodic element is still noticeable in this film it really sideshow to broader commentary on violence and the media and more conventional horror story the first film while often violent and gruesome was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant the premise of scream is that series of copycat killings begin when movie called stab based on book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers courtney cox about the events in scream is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening had heard about this scene before went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy its conclusion in which bleeding wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it publicity stunt is more surreal and disturbing than anything else the satire in scream thus takes on broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general although resident horror film geek randy jamie kennedy is back with fresh dialogue about sequels and interestingly enough how they are usually inferior to their predecessors the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well everything from friends and saved by the bell to showgirls and terminator is referenced here horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning and there aren any wes carpenter jokes this time more importantly this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from scream in fact the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as courtroom defense weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety and one man seems willing to save the heroine life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show understandably scream does not go so far as to actually blame the movies but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted couple that with the fact that several of the characters most notably the lead character sidney prescott neve campbell are fairly well developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine chilling suspense and what we have is pretty darned good horror movie in its own right we don just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered and in one case significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of crazed murderer lurking around the corner while have not seen any of his other work it easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated slasher film director as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing unfortunately scream occasionally reverts to the time honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window for example several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later there has been running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion there are also few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in situation such that he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction as for the question of whether or not scream is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor well it hard to say gave the first scream stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as light hearted send up scream bounces all over the place stylistically but it does better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment not sure which is the better movie but did leave the theater convinced of one thing sequels however much randy might argue do not necessarily suck

jonathan demme _beloved_ based on the book toni morrison is study in skillful literary adaptation on the one hand the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel evoking morrison pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice on the other hand beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story main events this choice is smartly made one for it creates an open space in which the story wide range of emotions can gestate and grow indeed the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled _beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century during the so called reconstruction era after the civil war for newly freed slaves it is time of confusion and turmoil oprah winfrey is sethe slave who escaped kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse where she hoped the terror would end what she did not know was that it would follow her there and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished _beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe search for forgiveness one long hampered by an unforgettable sin the film starts off on dreary day ten years after sethe escape as violent unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse invisible hands terrorize her family flinging objects across rooms shaking tables rattling floorboards sethe sons run away perhaps for good leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves demme matter of fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_ intriguing aspects all of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real when paul danny glover former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost hellish visions he doesn run in terror instead he asks who the ghost is as in morrison novel demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created sethe is the one being haunted but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears in fact the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay the story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved thandie newton young black clad woman who appears on sethe front lawn leaned christ like against tree stump sethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health they know not who she is but that doesn matter only paul is suspicious of the stranger little does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes and force sethe to release guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years winfrey is arguably beloved greatest asset she inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on tv talk show lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul as is kimberly elise as denver sethe wanderlusting daughter as sethe sage like mother in law old baby suggs beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears the film least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself thandie newton plays the glassy eyed girl with demented fervor which is endearing at first but which becomes off putting and unintentionally laughable by the end departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin howard_ director demme has used bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison novel totemic camera shots and color saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme films but the few he uses here work to the film benefit _beloved_ most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs gatherings in forest clearing where the bright yellow greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs words do for the most part though demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality this combined with morrison equally frugal method of storytelling may make _beloved_ somewhat of challenge to watch even to those familiar with the book though the film compliments the book extraordinarily well it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from film nothing is spoon fed to the viewer morrison novel is just as enigmatic but unlike movie book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb the movie begins like _poltergeist_ and ends like _the color purple_ with shades of _the scarlet letter_ and _little women_ somewhere in the middle taken as whole beloved is disquieting one of kind experience one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance
though it is fine piece of filmmaking there something about elizabeth that left me bit cold and think it is something that bugs me quite often in films particularly these days just didn care about the characters to me the first and foremost job of filmmaker is to create characters be they imagined or historical as the case may be that the audience gives hoot about and though elizabeth works well on many levels it falls short of excellence because of that very reason elizabeth takes place in england in 1554 as queen mary half sister of elizabeth and monarch on the side of catholicism is dying before she dies though she cannot bear to sign document which would condemn her half sister to death because of her heretical protestant beliefs as result amidst much anger within the council elizabeth becomes the queen of england the film chronicles her rise to power as she fights for unified church of england and tries to bring order to her personal and political life much of the film deals with elizabeth love for lord robert mysterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many woman as he continues to proclaim his love for the queen there is much ado about her lack of husband and political pressures from spain and france enter into the equation the problem with the film lies with this as its centerpiece as love interests are such character driven element didn much care about the characters perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played quite well by blanchett and so didn have much interest in who would join her in her nuptials the cast is rounded out well with the marvelous rush who plays the queen most loyal advisor sir francis and attenborough as well meaning but old fashioned lead council why then you must be asking do recommend elizabeth simply because it is the result of perfect pairing of director and cinematographer kapur and his cinematographer remi adefarasin neither of whom have heard create beautifully realized piece of filmmkaing from the technical side the light streams through each frame as in any painting from the period and beautifully captures the realistic light sources that would have been found in churches cellars and castles in 16th century europe each frame is rich with color contrasted with blackness or blown out beyaz light from windows the costumes by alexandra byrne deserve mention as they are such an inportant aspect of each shot indeed elizabeth is one of the most visually beautiful films of the decade ranking with kundun and braveheart watch also for the incredibly godfather esque mass murder scene it made me think in retrospect of the similarities between the two films
to paraphrase song title from an earlier disney movie mulan is whole new world the mouse factory latest feature is treasure featuring magnificent animation strong story and finely drawn characters mulan is the story of fiesty head strong young woman who unlike other disney heroines isn seeking her prince charming mulan motivations are simple to save her father serve her country and find place for herself in world in which females have no say the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at time when the huns have invaded the nation the emperor has called for conscription one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation mulan crippled father is called but mulan sneaks off steals his armor and takes his place mulan is saga of courage and self discovery yet despite the grim backdrop of war it is lively tale of self reliance and brain over brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy the movie utilizes strong corps of asian american talent as the voices for the main characters including the wonderful ming na wen the joy luck club as mulan wong as shang mulan commanding officer and later love interest pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon tek oh as mulan proud but loving father also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon sent by mulan ancestors to watch over and help the young woman his fast wise cracking hip talking mushu may seem out of place but it crowd pleasing performance especially for the youngsters the movie features only couple of songs fewer than most previous disney animated flicks but mulan are winners the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is plus mulan is treat more powerful than hercules with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame at about 85 minutes mulan moves rapidly and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end mulan will set new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain also it is hoped that the success of mulan and there is no doubt that it will prove to be popular vehicle will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them committed to lifelong learning through effective communication

elizabeth is potent historical drama set in england in the mid 1500s it is time when stately royal ceremonies are as commonplace as public burnings internally the catholics wage war against the protestants meanwhile spain scotland and france strategize their next moves in the struggle for power little does england know that young woman named elizabeth cate blanchett will be their greatest hope for survival the film charts elizabeth tumultuous struggle to gain true power over her kingdom as protestant she is the last person any of the catholic royalty would want to be queen but her half sister queen mary kathy burke deathly ill and unable to conceive child pleas with elizabeth to take over the throne mary gives her her blessing on only one condition that elizabeth renounce her faith and uphold the teachings of catholicism across the land once declared queen elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault both by her own subjects including the duke of norfolk played with steely eyed grace by christopher eccleston and by forces abroad slowly but surely the neophyte ruler takes england by its reigns and forges new path for her kingdom elizabeth is surrounded by keenly drawn cadre of subjects and advisers her closest ally is the mysterious sir francis walsingham geoffrey rush in perfectly subtle performance also on her side is sir william cecil sir richard attenborough her well meaning but misguided chief adviser with few people she can trust elizabeth must prove her self worth any way she can even if it means being the iron fisted ruler she secretly despises blanchett deserves an oscar for her performance as elizabeth she portrays the young queen with just the right balance of gawky self consciousness and shrewd charisma though not classical beauty blanchett is able to entrance the viewer with just coy smile or an impish smirk she is at home with her character playful tendencies particularly in one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly with childhood friend and lover lord robert dudley joseph fiennes whether fending off unctuous suitors or playing the houses in court blanchett elizabeth radiates confidence which impossible to dislike almost as interesting as the character of elizabeth are shekhar kapur visual delights he and cinematographer remi adefarasin have crafted film with rich color palette that is feast for the eyes rolling green hills extravagant ceremonial galas dark and foreboding corridors all are depicted with real sense of artistic appreciation the castles and cathedrals of europe have rarely been doted on so lovingly as they are here though writer michael hirst script gets little murky at times and his injections of humor get little overplayed elizabeth pulses with the right amount of dramatic and cinematic verve to make it just deserving of theatrical viewing as whole the story survives because elizabeth struggle is one which deserves attention by the time she makes her shocking but very sensible final declaration we re ready to bow to elizabeth as our own queen

the end of the affair is dark and moody romantic period piece that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs although it slow and sometimes confusing to follow it still manages to give audiences moving experience based on graham greene novel of the same name the film mainly follows characters there maurice bendrix ralph fiennes who has an affair with henry mile stephen rea wife sarah julianne moore sarah finds henry to be bore because well he just normal guy it all work and no play with him while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah and would do anything for her unfortunately the two break up this is all witnessed in serious of flashbacks so that leads us to the present it few years later and they both still think of each other so maurice hires private detective ian hart to see what sarah is up too while this may sound straight forward it not it deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men unhappiness and the ever lasting love all this may sound like drag but it really captures your interest with great performances by ralph fiennes doing another english patient type of film only this movie is better and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all films she did in 1999 believe this was the role she had the most passion for and you can see why the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan even though didn read the book there no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive what so moving about it you ask the tragedy of it all it not the typical romance in which guy finds girl they fall in love and all is well this is more complicated and depressing it really shows the complexity of relationship because nothing is ever perfect everyone feels different way and that is what tears us to pieces back to neil jordan script it wasn only kirmizi roses there were times when felt it too be little slow but most romances are it also tended to be bit confusing especially at the start it keep jumping around from past to present so it obviously took awhile to get grasp of things also notable was the superb direction by neil jordan have to say this is his finest achievement to date because quite frankly ve never really found his work to be up to par it just never did anything for me until now when it ends it leaves viewers little saddened but provoked nonetheless this is definitely one of the best films of 99 and had some of the best acting most notably by moore not for all movie goers but for those who are film buffs and want something of value
sometimes you just have to tip your hat to film sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes surprised they may have been when they realized that this picture actually had something to say but by the attentiveness of the crowd say they were won over as was can tell yet if truman really is that good or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year time alone will make that call but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank side we were concerned for his well being and wanted him to win that we felt as we did is tribute both to the film and to jim carrey who has achieved legitimacy at last the truman show is film best viewed cold with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot unless you re under media blackout however you probably know the basics carrey stars as truman burbank capra esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl laura linney in the south florida island town of seahaven which looks like michael eisner idea of the perfect american small town truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle complete with working wife best bud friendly neighbors and interesting co workers there is tragedy in his past his father drowned in horrible boating accident leaving truman with dreadful fear of water and of travel in general but overall life is good but then one day as truman leaves his house for work klieg light falls magically from the sky this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows that he is prisoner on the world biggest soundstage that his wife friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him and that his life has for over 10 000 days been broadcast as the world most popular television program what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir the soundstage we re told is only the second man made structure visible from space truman movements are tracked ceaselessly by 000 cameras scattered throughout the town button cams dashboard cams mirror cams wife cams big cams and small cams weir cuts the film so we re never quite sure if we re watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show omnipotent creator christof ed harris who oversees the show from control room built into the man made moon in seahaven sky the second act offers plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence his best friend marlon noah emmerich always has six pack of beer with him his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town one wonders why he didn pick up on any of this earlier but christof has an answer for this people tend to accept the reality with which they re presented nevertheless truman begins to grow restless and dreams of escape to fiji where an old college sweetheart natasha mcelhone supposedly lives this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is magical and provocative concept the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way by underplaying truman he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over there is particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon and marlon answers with best friend sincerity gladly step in front of bus for you but that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof the abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home and from that moment we re on his side the truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies haven we all at least once doubted our place in the world doubted the sincerity of those closest to us ultimately however the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator what does god really think of us does he resent our abandonment of paradise who exactly is watching us up there in the sky if you enjoy the picture as much as did credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work as for carrey well truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play carrey is no jimmy stewart to his credit he doesn try to be he just tries to feel the way you or would if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us

countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally luckily movie reviewers aren burdened with such legislation otherwise small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer in case of star wars 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas the consequences would be even more severe because that film is very special for tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of fans in any case objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best if not the best film of all times those who don usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery the author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold objective standards in reviewing this film like so many previous reviewers must note that watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago and that remained enchanted by the experience ever since perhaps it was childlike fascination with until then unimaginable wonders that happened long time ago in galaxy far away or perhaps it was the rush felt minutes before the opening shots with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation had read before anyway watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life and it was also unmatched for many years to come because very few movies managed to have such strong impact on me like george lucas epic star wars wasn just important movie for me or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment it was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema until than american motion picture industry was in limbo social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood and new authors filled the void mostly by using hollywood financial and technical resources to create serious personal or artsy movies as result audience traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate didn want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen george lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm and huge financial success of the movie later backed by supplement industry of toys books comics role playing games and other merchandise slowly began to change the face of hollywood serious adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion and were replaced by industrial products of blockbuster philosophy one of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre until 1977 science fiction movies were mostly in production domain in late 1960s bigger budgets for science fiction didn look so strange anymore thanks to the great success of 2001 space odyssey but the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production mostly dark dystopic movies however in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies even among the audience that usually doesn like it as result seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away although some good dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s after that science fiction continued to be considered synonym for family entertainment ironically the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of new hollywood generation of young movie authors who made artsy and personal films in early 1970s george lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 and nostalgic drama american graffiti both movies were considered personal in its time despite latter one becoming very popular in sense star wars is an also very personal film and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it not for it but unlike many personal movies of the era its personality was in line with the wishes of the general audience the plot set long time ago in galaxy far away begins in time of civil war the evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic in order to quash any opposition the empire had built death star superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets the information about death star acquired by rebel intelligence is being transported by princess leia organa carrie fisher when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser princess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots c3po anthony daniels and r2d2 kenny baker those two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker mark hamill young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot his adventure begins when r2d2 escapes because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi alec guiness old man is actually the last surviving jedi knight member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force after some hesitation luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess while the old man would teach him the ways of the force their small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo harrison ford and his furry sidekick chewbacca peter mayhew critics who don like the movie especially those who can forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of new hollywood are prone to point the lack of originality on the surface they might be right lucas himself admits that he found lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood westerns wwii aviation movies old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa samurai classic the hidden fortress on the other hand those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further into collective subconscious of western civilisation hinted by some mild tolkien references the others would find the author element within the story star wars could be seen as an anti establishment film young long haired easy going nature loving heroes are fighting against old uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes even out of its historical or social context star wars is an impressive as strictly technical piece of the seven art george lucas direction is very good with the clever editing and well paced segments between action and dramatic buildup characters are well drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster we have coming of age hero damsel in distress somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time reluctant helper benevolent mentor diabolical villain and finally comic relief in form of two non human characters some of the actors are very good alec guiness in his most famous role to date james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form unfortunately the same can be said for the main leads among the main trio of mark hamill carrie fisher and harrison ford only the last one had the character three dimensional enough to launch his further acting career the thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology often comparisons with 2001 space odyssey another ground breaking sf film were citing the sheer number of effects as proof of the lucas superiority over kubrick however the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive even after two decades although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly yet they aren the most remembered trademark of the movie that honour should definitely go to the oscar winning soundtrack by john williams whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career newer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release yet even if they are immune to the george lucas magic they should watch this film nevertheless perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture
can sum up first strike in one word awesome never in my life have seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie he ever appeared in he should be awarded greatly the same tom and jerry formula that was used to make chan rumble in the bronx and supercop so entertaining can be found here as well however first strike was probably the most exciting out of the three for the simple reason that practice makes perfect his last two movies were almost like practice and this one was great like rumble this film is about the mafia the former kgb now chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against group of very large bad men the trailer for the film sums it up quite well first strike is action packed but the fight scenes are so fast and furious they almost have witty italian like humor to them jackie chan is regular comedian well he no eddie murphy but he can really crack you up for example he is hanging off roof and he humorously taunts his foes to come and get him as he claims to be the korean 007 that secret agent james bond even the plot to this film improved above the others as sort of twisted nuclear weapon smuggling deal is botched and jackie takes the blame but never fear as the chinese mafia aids him in uncovering the truth behind the incident with some of the most high flying stunts and side splitting comedy first strike is sure fire hit that guaranteed to draw some major world wide attention
quentin tarantino seems to have knack for giving his stars big careers after his pulp fiction many actors began receiving many offers for jobs john travolta made his come back and is now one of today most bankable stars bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor jackie brown on the other hand boasts quite well known cast except for the main lead pam grier most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films but she never really had breakthrough performance her first film was in the roger ebert written beyond the valley of the dolls that is until now jackie brown is highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction after mediocre acting jobs tarantino returns to what made his name household one directing and writing jackie brown is the result and it is fantastic entertainment despite excellent direction from tarantino the cast steals the film giving one good performance after another pam grier gives stunning performance as jackie brown and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent samuel jackson bridget fonda michael keaton robert de niro and robert forster more than likely you will see few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations describing quentin tarantino film is very difficult as you really can say much or you spoil it for everyone else will tread lightly jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown grier in mavi outfit walking through the airport the camera tracks along with her and ends up revealing her occupation we are also introduced to ordell robbie jackson who sells illegal guns to interested buyers for hefty price ms brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away however an fbi agent keaton and local cop michael bowen are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money they try to reach him through beaumont livingston chris tucker one of ordell buyers but he mysteriously ends up dead they try again through brown but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong doing but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell friends fonda she is caught and sent to jail ordell pays her bail through bail bond agent max cherry forster and then wants to find out what she told the cops after she claims to have said nothing she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison ordell doesn like this but they both come up with scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track this scheme seems to be going as planned but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown and that the biggest reason to go see tarantino film tarantino seems to have fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments and slang terms but they are always done very well and believably his hitmen are normally cruel but pleasant in that nasty sort of way they talk like normal people except for when doing business and they are rude to their girlfriends of course this is tarantino film and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop of course tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film adding lot of his reservoir dogs style storytelling to it things are told from one person perspective and then from another and then from another each time learning more and more this all leads up to very interesting conclusion which decides who is on whose side on the technical side of jackie brown quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film however this time around it isn as nearly as impressive or original the writing on the other hand is quite good although do find tarantino use of slang terms offensive the story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction but it much more easy to understand his previous film needed second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation but jackie brown is very simply to follow especially considering that the time is given during the leaps in time perhaps this is result of the screenplay being written from the novel rum punch by elmore leonard the dialogue is pretty much intelligent and all the characters are fully realized the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro who has worked with tarantino on previous films and the editing is very good and as with pulp fiction the music is highlight bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s the acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable the performances are incredibly rich with hidden meaning behind every characters actions nothing is quite as it seems and you can really tell which side one person is on the real treat of course is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits which play an important role in the film watching grieg could tell what was going through her mind even if didn know what she was thinking her face portrays lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad happy or in deep thought bridget fonda gives very good performance as druggie couch potato didn even realize it was fonda until saw her name in the final credits her performance actually reminded me of heather graham in boogie nights michael keaton comes across very well as does michael bowen chris tucker has small but effective performance samuel jackson is very good but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction although much less cynical but no matter jackson is very strong in his role robert de niro is actually little annoying at times but overall he does good job as one of ordell perspective clients and friends robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film as he has one of the most developed characters he is present throughout most of the film and he holds his own against jackson and grier jackie brown is rated for language sex violence drug use and some offensive remarks as film by itself jackie brown is terrific piece of entertainment with complex plot to draw viewers in however one can not help but compare it to tarantino pulp fiction and expect great results when compared it comes up short but not that short it worthy effort with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as major hollywood actress can remember seeing her in anything except for small role in mars attacks but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one expect to see her name floating around the oscar nominations and hopefully she will even be able to nab one
there are times when the success of particular film depends entirely on one actor effort often single performance can turn what might have been rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile when one of these comes along usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders but sometimes there is simply no other explanation and such is the case with the hurricane this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin hurricane carter would normally be called norman jewison the hurricane as per the tradition of referring to film belonging to director but though he does decent work jewison cannot claim ownership of the hurricane because there is one reason this film works at all and his name is denzel washington washington plays carter boxer who in 1967 was convicted of late night shooting in bar jailed for 20 years he maintained that he had never committed the crimes but remained in jail after second trial and countless appeals the situation changed when group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter through the efforts of that group and carter lawyers he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted the film details carter childhood which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of racist cop dan hedaya when he finally got out of prison for good carter became rising star as middleweight pro boxer seemingly having his career on track until the police framed him for multiple homicide despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities he remained imprisoned flash forward to 1983 when lesra vicellous reon shannon young african american boy living with group of canadian tutors reads the book carter wrote while in prison the book entitled the sixteenth round opens young lesra eyes to the injustice that was carter life and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer lesra convinces his canadian friends deborah unger liev schreiber john hannah to work with him towards his goal the hurricane leans on denzel washington he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will and he does so brilliantly it probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter because he plays character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter fictional personality invented solely for the film the actor work is masterful washington throws himself into every moment refusing to keep the audience at arm length we feel everything he feels the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost washington is performance of weight and emotional depth he doesn merely play angry happy or sad he feels it at the deepest level his work is masterful and for half of this film realized that the scene was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor norman jewison directs the film doing reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection the hurricane moves quickly with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is and nothing is terribly confusing his boxing scenes constructed with clear inspiration from raging bull get inside the action very well and they are believable as real sports footage jewison puts together particularly nice scene by utilizing pretty cool trick carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear prison uniform and jewison assisted by some wonderful acting from game washington shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell jewison best achievement in the hurricane is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard knock life and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again sadly though the film chief failures lie with the screenplay as with most of the good but not great efforts to round the pike this winter there is much to interest viewer in the hurricane but it seems that every time the film gets chance to take the most clich route possible it does take look at the supporting characters for example who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil carter and lesra played nicely by shannon who deserves credit are the only real people here everyone else is stereotype the canadians are good the cops are bad the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey dovey commune and it is commune despite the film failure to make that clear while every racist cop especially dan hedaya melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every siyah person that enters the room much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey hate put me in prison love gonna bust me out and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from made for tv lifetime special it too bad the cast is game the director does his job and the subject matter is interesting but the script takes the safer slightly more boring route far too often wanted real reason for the cop to hold grudge against carter other than he racist pig wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice in short wanted to see the film through less distorted lens criticism has been levied against the liberties the hurricane takes with the truth of what really happened to carter and much of it is deserved for example the film gives us boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello only to be screwed by the judges who ruled giardello the winner most accounts of the fight however have carter losing fairly furthermore much of carter criminal past is conveniently left out of the film and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained of course the hurricane works mainly as fable so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially but even dismissing such issues don remove one fact the hurricane is highly flawed film only one actor could have made schmaltzy predictable picture like this work as well as it does and it good thing the hurricane has that actor carter has been quoted as saying denzel washington is making me look good but he not the only one washington makes this film look good denzel washington the hurricane sounds pretty good to me
seen august 1998 at at rotterdam square cinemas rotterdam ny theater #6 by myself for free using my sony loews critic pass [theater rating good seats sound and picture] war is topic that can help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media movies documentaries and even history books have way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on such as strategy politics and victory it easy to forget war in its most basic form is battle of armies out to slaughter each other forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier no matter what his rank or importance is real flesh and blood person and not just number saving private ryan is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect especially in its unapologetic realistic delivery it proves there huge difference between battling and killing the film opens with one of the most graphic disturbing scenes in recent memory it world war ii day to be exact and the military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them spielberg uses many techniques to create for total sense of reality instead of positioned cameras the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared there is no sense of stability but of constant anxious and confusing motion giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle and just vulnerable as the poor troops poor is proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters we don get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated but as people that must be destroyed because they re there in the movies the good guys can run through firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get scratch but in reality that wouldn happen the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well secured germans who can actually see who what and where they re shooting unlike the americans who must fire in general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are but that seems to be part of the theme the film seems to rely on the audience sense of patriotism that the american military is right and good and that the nazis are inherently evil the battle scene eventually focuses on group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold whole 50 foot progression and begin to inflict some damage have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up couldn help but feel some sense of joy and relief to triumph against all odds is cliche to be sure but there nothing cliche about the graphic detailed atmosphere here because it really happened one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet tom hanks stars as captain miller relatively average man who happens to be the leader of platoon he never obsessive or any such generic cartoonish characteristic that might dominate character like this he doesn want to be there any more than his men but when he is given mission he intends to carry it out the mission the film is concerned with is as the title states saving private ryan through series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker it is brought to general attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each death simultaneously when they learn fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe they make it top priority to have him returned safely to his mother it easy to sympathize with this situation after all no one should have to lose all their children at once but finding one man in this war is as miller puts it like trying to find needle in stack of needles the saving of private ryan isn just dramatic device but thematic one his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country the world even was trying to convince itself it still had when miller company hears of the mission they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead but miller isn so quick to shrug it off he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope and now he has the opportunity to make someone sense of hope reality the mission to find ryan gives miller group destination but not direction along the way many things happen to them both good and bad few battles are fought not to be major accomplishments for the war but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice the act of killing itself becomes one of the film major philosophical metaphors the soldiers don mind killing other soldiers in blind battle but when they come across lone survivor who begs them to let him go they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses unfortunately death is fact of war and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters but here spielberg doesn want us to think these men are invincible in fact only small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man and the performances are good enough to make this method work although the characters are somewhat typical the actors maintain control over the material at all time whether they re arguing with each other telling stories of back home or fighting the germans they never go overboard and always seem believable sure there zinger here and there but war doesn change the fact boys will be boys if and when one dies we too can feel the loss even though we hardly knew them the final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous violent battle sequence private ryan has been found but facing four to one odds can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive that not premise for thrills it symbolic of everything the film has worked for it would be wrong to say the film has either happy or sad ending it ends the way it must end remember reading calvin hobbes comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like dad how do armies of men killing each other solve problems saving private ryan is the adult version of that question
what if one of our cities became the target for terror what can we do what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster so far america has been the leading nation opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world it is the land of opportunities it is the land of freedom but what if it became the new target this dark fantasy has unfortunately very strong grounding in reality when special branch of the united states military under the command of general william devereaux bruce willis takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice the only warning the fbi receives is single cryptic message release him then all hell breaks loose in new york bus is destroyed killing 25 civilians broadway theater is bombed hostages are taken at school as the wave of terrorist activity crests the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law devereaux argues against that eventuality but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 000 men into action on american soil another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard denzel washington the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities his staff is comprised of smart energetic intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group moronic feds we re used to seeing in movies hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft annette bening whose department knows more about the situation than they re willing to reveal but the attacks escalate the fbi are helpless chasing an invisible enemy the land is under siege they have lost control terror is coming from within what great about this film is that it is made as if holding up mirror to life it reflects reality and that why it makes such an impact edward zwick has created clever well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously and so his film plays on several levels never loosing focus on its main objective he is exploring the abuse of power the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the government the army the fbi and the cia he takes look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii there are concentration camps and unlawful interments all in the name of the greater good in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul freedom was that what the terror ists really wanted this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab american population in the and especially but to me these protests seem unnecessary zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys the script is therefore wonderfully balanced agent hubbard best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad tony shalhoub is lebanese american and it is quite often you hear lines such as my first boyfriend was palestinian they seduce you with their suffering or they love this country as much as we do but no matter how you twist this matter you won get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab speaking population who are in the great majority more to the point the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab americans by the military and thus this film does not serve as source for discrimination in any way denzel washington is dashing as always in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual anette bening is enjoyable and believable as shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage network of snitches and seduction to gather information bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist hungry for power that never looses his connection with the audience since his point of view is not too hard to understand the film is elegantly shaped the scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension horror and emotions and does it with rarely observed professionalism he tightens the intensity as the events progress and when plot twist comes it actually is surprising it is not film drained in patriotism like the work of roland emerich nor is it film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values it is daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such risky story and difficult journey it has courage enough to get involved in politics it questions our foreign policies mentality and defense must admit that it ends rather disappointing as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down but despite of that it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling film that provokes emotions and thoughts virtue that few summer films can boast of this is the army it broadsword not scalpel believe me you do not want us in an american city gen william devereaux the siege
it was easy to fear the worst begin with classic 1960 television series add big budget and an list star in the lead role and stir script you ask who needs one kid we ve got ourselves formula that was my fear bloated monster without any sense of direction then much to my amazement everything that could possibly go wrong didn the fugitive is as lean taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years under the direction of andrew davis 1992 under siege the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go expect box office to go through the roof deservedly and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones the premise is simple one dr richard kimble harrison ford is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer man with an artificial arm after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during transfer goes awry kimble finds himself on the run his one goal to find the one armed man andreas katsulas before marshall sam gerard tommy lee jones finds him where the fugitive surprises the most is the script by jeb stuart and david twohy in genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence its attention to detail and its respect for the audience in an early sequence kimble sneaks into hospital to shave of his beard slick back his hair and change into lab coat on his way out police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn know is kimble to zip up his pants it small moment but it punches home the urgency of kimble situation and exactly what man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget later while trying to lose himself in parade kimble thinks to drop his overcoat the most likely way he be recognized from behind it these details which convince us that when colleague of kimble tells gerard that he too smart to be caught he may just be right credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators the bus crash which allows kimble escape is spectacular sequence as is leap from dam into the water below the action is crisp and brutal and never romanticized special kudos go to director davis for maintaining relentless pace which underscores the single mindedness of the two leads and what pair of performances those leads are tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard because he manages an incredibly challenging feat for the first third of the film there is really no villain per se kimble is on the run and gerard is out to find him it would have been very easy to turn gerard into malevolent vindictive inspector javert but that never happens instead jones plays him as sharp committed man who just doing his job so that when he responds to kimble comment didn kill my wife with matter of fact don care we know exactly what he means it not his job to determine guilt or innocence it his job to bring in fugitive this is well written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form the only unfortunate thing about jones stunning turn is that it likely to overshadow harrison ford and that shame for his entire career ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero however he does fine job with the less flashy part of kimble always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence the fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing and ford is up to the task this summer has been loaded with action suspense films and most of them have been doing brisk business however it time for clint sean and various dinosaurs to step aside the chase is on my advice is to catch it
it been long time since walt disney has delivered us classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast sure there have been delightful outings like last years hercules but nothing entirely groundbreaking with the release of the studio newest feature length film remake of edgar rice burrough creation tarzan disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques it no classic but this new tarzan represents exactly what family film should be the plot is loyal to the original storyline as tarzan parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire and find shelter in the jungles of africa but they are killed offscreen by the snarling cheetah sabor leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib found by kala voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close kindhearted mother and member of gorilla pack tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own we follow the young boy through the years as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk very brash but funny rosie donnell and clumsy elephant tantor wayne knight of course in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero in tarzan these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously gags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here most of the characters are amusing without being forced as tarzan grows to manhood the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture here the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton brian blessed who accompanying hapless professor nigel hawthorne on an expedition through the jungle of course there the professor daughter jane nicely vocalized by cheerful minnie driver who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie the thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation directors chris buck and kevin lima have applied breathtaking element to the movement of the athletic title character and the fast paced editing is absolutely marvel as tarzan carries jane through the treetops narrowly escaping pack of nasty baboons he slips and slides like daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave your eyes can barely keep up it fantastic accomplishment the subject matter here is also notch or two above animation average there are important questions raised about tarzan place in the world and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters there is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward which is surprising plus that wasn expecting to find here suffice to say this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained the grown up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn who made name for himself as the `big mean jerk from ghost goldwyn is effective playing someone who not aware of his world dangers glenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother and lance henriksen from tv millennium is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of human child as the movie villain there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton it helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm but he is nothing compared to james woods hilarious hades from hercules burley guy with big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all together noticeable screen presence still this is one great thrill ride that disney has constructed never expected rice burrough work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation nor with so much emotional depth parents along with all the kiddies are going to find much to like in tarzan
costume drama set in the 1500s england elizabeth is lush romantic political masterpiece about the upset over the crossing of protestant queen from respected catholic one when the court and country are whole after the passing of the queens the royal family so to speak are upset that protestant should be crowened and not another catholic plus the new queen elizabeth cate blanchette was the bastard baby of the previous queen mary father the persecution over catholics and protestants isn the only majority in elizabeth elizabeth must face the decision to give up personal pleasures and her lover joseph fiennes of shakespeare in love in order to rule successfully the country which she did for 40 more years both elizabeth and shakespeare in love are set in the elizabethian era and both feature queen elizabeth judi dench plays her in love or course yet found elizabeth more stimulating and involving than love not just because elizabeth features great deal more of elizabeth but because found blanchette more powerful hypnotic sense for the role elizabeth also featuring geoffrey rush and richard attenborough is my pick for the best picture of 1998 award it dynamic important breathtaking film of loyalty power greed and trust shakespeare would die for the book rights
of the major horror sub genres vampire movies are easily the most adaptable think about it frankenstein movies haven changed all that much because they still need that mad scientist in bavarian castle setting if you made frankenstein movie today you have to have the monster be virus or something and outside of michael fox there aren any actors that could play virus convincingly movies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt there not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris unless you want to have teenage werewolf or something and there that michael fox thing again but you can have vampires do anything and you can place them in any genre you want just about you can have traditional vampire movies bram stoker dracula or have the anne rice version interview with the vampire or play it for laughs vampire in brooklyn you can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california the lost boys to squalid mexican dives from dusk till dawn to your local high school buffy the vampire slayer were it not redundant you could have movie about law firm full of vampires any day now expect we ll see movie about vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play day game in order to break the home run record or you can insert the vampire legend into hong kong action movie and when you do that you get blade wesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie the silent expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path in this case the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead bleeding corpses snipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in marshals but does demonstrably better job here as half vampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers blade is silent brooding presence laying waste to vampires without shred of remorse he is as cold as his silver bladed sword as single minded as his garlic filled bullets yet he not without quirks blade drives battered muscle car and has to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent like any good hong kong movie blade is heavy on the chopsocky action for some reason blade spends lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional anti vampire weapons of garlic and silver blade dismisses man portable arc lamp as being too heavy although it looks to be more efficient tool to dispatch vampires unfortunately the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers which it most strongly resembles the replacement killers is the last movie saw that didn review mostly because it made no impression on me and couldn remember anything other than noise violence and the intensity of fat performance blade has little more going for it and has the vampire myth to draw from but other than that it the same kind of movie exciting with well choreographed action scenes but with no resonance with stronger villain stephen dorff is pardon the pun curiously bloodless as the head vampire leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role wittier script and strong supporting cast blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment as it is blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber and the vampire movies just keep multiplying
not since 1996 shine which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott has movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world class musicians in fact if one were to watch these films together it would almost certainly stand as convincing argument that life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills yet hilary and jackie the sophomore effort from director anand tucker has something more to say it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in very compelling tale emily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale playing the sisters du pr both musicians from childhood hilary griffiths is renowned flutist while jacqueline watson is easily as skilled on the cello the two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women both together and seperate their careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another and although their lives take very different paths hilary settles down to marriage and family while rachel skips across the globe on world concert tour they are bound together by their deep family love the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance they contrast each other wonderfully and while watson portrayal of jackie du pr is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic both characters are charged with emotion the frank cottrell boyce script which is based on the book by hilary and piers du pr brings great deal of depth to these characters as well the script is also to be commended for its well polished dual nature cottrell boyce adopts style which one might expect to see in mystery thriller which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert towne script for mission impossible and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame the latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story some will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised nevertheless hilary and jackie is movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is decent watch all around
first am not big fan of the files tv series have nothing against it particularly just don happen to watch it having said that can now say that liked the files pretty well for us non fans there nothing big going for it but there are lot of little things the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 000 two proto humans enter the cave and find space alien cocooned inside the alien breaks free and kills one man in struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien the movie jumps to the same cave today where boy lucas siyah from sling blade is captured by the same siyah ooze we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder gillian anderson and david duchovny who have been pulled off of their previous assignment investigations into the paranormal and put onto the bomb squad detail caller has threatened federal building in dallas texas on hunch mulder checks out the building across the street and wouldn you know it he turns out to be right the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse five people die in the blast and when mulder learns who the victims were light bulb goes on over his head the two agents team up to investigate against fbi orders the links mulder has made their search leads them back to the north texas cave all across the country and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to the truth the plot and the truth are uninspired got the feeling that what learned was supposed to shock and amaze me it didn the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them but the point of the files is not what the truth is but the extent to which it has been hidden it slightly more interesting angle but it still raises expectations about that truth too high if this were the whole film would say the movie was mediocre perhaps even boring but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest before the audience can get tired of one location the agents follow hot tip to another location and so on and so forth the locations are not all computer generated sets either there are some artificial settings but the desert night of nevada the edge of suburbia in texas and the endless fields of snow in antarctica actually somewhere in north america make this fantastic film feel more real ward russell cinematography is very good the overall look is dark and ominous appropriate to the intended tone of the film plot russell is able to make something as innocuous as cornfield look foreboding when the movie is set in darkness the picture quality is still rich and detailed finally and specifically there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of fast oncoming train don know if the shot is faked in any way but it looks dangerous and it looks great the movie soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film skip to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie there is spoiler in the following sentences during the opening prehistoric sequence howling wind dogs the soundtrack never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound in one of the movie most effective sequences metallic doors suddenly slam open to release cloud of buzzing bees the visuals of the scene are good but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound there was no question as to who the movie stars would be even so duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and good combination both are easy on the eyes and together they have some good timing banter and energy there is hint of chemistry between them but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship they are like couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street there might be some romantic interest but for now they re more interested in their environs than they are in each other no single element really makes this movie outstanding not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular but enough things were done right that the files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along
many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come the new film by visionary director vincent ward most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors but little do they know as so plainly found out that this has quite complex story to tell walking out of the theater could see the audience disgust one member even had to be awakened after the film ended don believe the previews that you see this is definitely not film for everyone this is quite possibly one of the most adult oriented films to come out in recent years kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us it goes back and forth in time as if it has no boundaries think of the film city of angels now add more complex screenplay and more unique vision both films deal with the afterlife but doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office costing around $85 million to make the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it money back but due to it story doubt it will for everyone who thought titanic story was too simple and cliche here is proof that if james cameron had written more complex screenplay it may not have done nearly as well but don get me wrong hope the film does do well it vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen doubt most of us could have thought of this place even in our own mind what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals the only film that surpasses it is dark city full of rich shocking colors we get to see heaven that most of us would probably die to get to but don do that because you ll end up going to hell what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on lake chris christy nielsen robin williams is startled by the sudden jolt but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat annie annabella sciorra spies chris as well and both eventually bond and get married annie is an artist whose paintings are colorful lush and surrealistic chris is doctor and loves annie more than life itself they also have two children marie jessica brooks and ian josh paddock but one day the two children are killed in car crash and it almost destroys annie she tries to commit suicide but fails and is then put in an institution chris copes with the problem by realizing they aren around anymore and nothing will change that just as annie gets her life back in order chris is killed while trying to save the life of car crash victim chris goes to heaven or his version of heaven rather guided by albert cuba gooding jr chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy that is until he realizes how miserable he is without annie prior to heaven he would try to comfort annie but the more he was around the more pain she felt chris decides to leave her alone little does he realize what will happen next not about to say because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story many critics however give it away certainly chris dying is crucial to the plot but they tell you that he dies in the previews story is not necessarily important for this movie to work because it deals with the afterlife however strangely virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil couple of comments here and there but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life we re soul mates chris exclaims heaven in movies is almost always depicted as glowing city of beyaz purity and love usually it also looks like it rests among the clouds but what dreams may come goes different route it shows us heaven that most of us have never seen before chris heaven is his memories brought to life his thoughts can make anything real and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven ve never seen anyone use real paint before albert says equally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone instead it state of being in one gloriously horrific scene chris and his tracker max von sydow arrive at sea of faces thousands of heads are stuck above ground their bodies somewhere else mostly dead silent some quips are made almost as if to lighten the mood it truly frightening sequence production designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination using state of the art computer technology worlds are created for exploration sometimes some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact it not necessary to be there but we appreciate seeing it costume designer yvonne blake who also appears in the film has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes cinematographer eduardo serra whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove has difficult job as most cinematographers do working with special effects but serra entire universe is computer generated image and he does masterful job writer ron bass adapting from the novel by richard matheson provides very fluid screenplay with no real set plot the story is extremely vague in its details allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning and director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision what dreams may come is good example of german expressionism which may just turn off good portion of the audience your average movie goer more than likely isn used to expressionistic techniques the film will also definitely draw attention from religious people but they shouldn take it too far it is after all just movie robin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances while his comedic roles have been suffering his comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff but when is confined by screenplay he isn quite as effective but drama is really his strong point and you can see that here it doubtful he ll get another oscar nomination but wouldn really mind if he did the real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land this may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention it also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination however the academy doesn like to award performances for these types of films cuba gooding jr has been better but he certainly not distracting max von sydow is underused as are jessica brooks and josh paddock treat for some movie goers is to see werner herzog appear if they even recognize him as chris father lost in the sea of faces it not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images overall it williams and sciorra film what dreams may come is rated pg 13 for thematic elements involving death some disturbing images language and some partial nudity the film is definitely aimed at more adult audience some will find the plot distracting some will find the visuals absolutely glorious and some will find both the only real problem with the film that could see was that it slows down considerably during the midsection just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins by the way some controversy even surrounded the title which was mistaken for sexual term what becomes wet and you should understand in actuality the title is from soliloquy in hamlet just thought should let you know
don let the following quirks of this review fool you into believing that this movie is anything short of an ultimate labour of love but one can see the humour of roberto benigni when you see that life is beautiful even though short ugly looking man with an obnoxious laugh life is beautiful even though haven amounted to much in life except working out the finer intricacies of waitering lucky sort of guy especially when beautiful woman strips away my venner of superficiality to find new age sensitive guy with the biggest heart in the entire world underneath life is beautiful jew but life can still be beautiful the nazis put me in concentration camp but life is still beautiful love my son very much and that what matters and that what makes life beautiful my ability to entertain somehow convinces my son that living in concentration camp is somewhat beautiful get shot for my efforts and the woman love but hey that life and that still beautiful thing so by jove don give me any crap about it by far the movie with the biggest heart this decade and well deserves every nomination and award that it has achieved well done there should be more film directors and actors like you roberto benigni

there good news and bad news about mulan the positive is that disney has found happy medium between the heavy handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules on the other hand the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast but mulan is step in the right direction and disney best animated feature since the lion king after giving native americans turn in pocahontas disney has decided to turn movie over to the asians mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever popular heroine who marches to different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married that what we find out when young mulan voice of ming na wen screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting rogue cricket splash coffee all over her cartoons meanwhile word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns since mulan girl that means her decrepit old father must go she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family that chinese culture for you so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place the movie in nutshell is about the stuggles of being woman in the army it should have been called chang mulan calls on her ancestors for help they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her but mini dragon named mushu screws it up voiced by eddie murphy mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges murphy performance is direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin lots of wisecracks and ad libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they re going to have you ain never had friend like mushu speaking of songs mulan doesn have too many of them which is plus with story like this disney songs about war probably wouldn go over too well heigh ho heigh ho it off to war go and the ones they do have aren memorable the best of the bunch sad to say is be man the requisite basic training montage song yes even in medieval china they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle sung by donnie osmond bad sign if ever there was one be man accompanies footage of mulan platoon going from screw ups to heroes it makes me wonder has there ever been musical montage in movie that ended badly only wish real life problems could be solved in two minutes with peppy montage for the curious mulan does pass for man in the army despite looking like girl all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to sexy shoulder length talk macho and slap guys on the butt as was male custom thousand years ago in china the deception fools everyone but the audience who thinks she might be able to pass for 12 year old boy at best but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army led by big evil eyed attilla looking monster as villain the head of the huns is menacing evil and entirely forgettable saw the movie yesterday and don remember the man name otherwise mulan is good movie the animation of the characters themselves isn as rich as it could and should be but there are some amazing battlefield shots eddie murphy pulls off some good one liners as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita the quintessential asian movie star hell george mr sulu takei does voice in mulan you get the sense disney said to themselves alright let get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood who can you think of well there mr myagi good and mr sulu perfect we ve got ourselves movie now soon disney really _will_ be able to paint with all the colors of the wind
with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the film noir genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control fargo miller crossing blood simple and off the wall comedies centered around an eccentric scatter brained lead character raising arizona the hudsucker proxy their latest offering the big lebowski falls within the latter category though there are elements of the crime gone wrong theme and even touch of satire to be found in this film the main difference however is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn quite have the brains to get it all together the main character of the big lebowski seems like fairly intelligent guy who wise to the world but he doesn really want to do much of anything besides go bowling smoke pot and generally relax that main character is jeffrey the dude lebowski jeff bridges introduced by the film rambling narrator sam elliott as quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county the dude is unemployed needless to say and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends walter john goodman borderline psychotic who in the habit of pulling gun when he thinks somebody cheating in bowling match has the whole world gone crazy he shouts at suspected cheater and donny steve buscemi who always few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it donny you have no frame of reference here these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana john turturro who when we first meet him is doing dance in the bowling lane to accompany spanish version of hotel california and if it possible seems to be even more of head case than walter if that doesn give you good idea of this film absurdist tone then perhaps this will the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude rug they ve mistaken him for millionaire of the same name who is also known as the big lebowski david huddleston and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny tara reid owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ben gazzara the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug he doesn have any luck but when bunny is apparently kidnapped the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom unfortunately walter gets involved and fouls up the drop off and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers the dude car gets stolen along with the briefcase containing the money soon the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by group of german nihilists who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn meanwhile the big lebowski daughter maude julianne moore feminist avant garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked wants to recover the money for her family the plot however is really just vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival run through the jungle and it fits the coens see los angeles as veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble usually unsuccessfully the film doesn feature quite as many one liners and sight gags as the coens other comedies though there are few hilarious moments of visual humor particularly in the dude dream sequences and acid flashbacks but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact the film sometimes seems little disjointed as result you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this jungle but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be somewhat anticlimactic resolution there also noticeable but not too heavy handed thread of social commentary in the big lebowski which incidentally takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin at the beginning we see george bush on television making his this aggression will not stand speech the coens take aim at just about every elite subculture in the book the egotistical wealthy businessman the bums will always lose shouts the big lebowski at one point the porn industry the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their peaceful beach community and so on by the end we really start to admire the dude who almost certainly harbors the least aggression of anyone in this story his passive resistance emphasis on passive albeit to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in film overflowing with quirky characters he also turns out to have pretty well functioning brain in his head even if he doesn like to use it very much his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he getting run around and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness but they don just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either think that more than anything is what makes the big lebowski standout comedy it manages to approach characters like the dude and to some extent walter with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter brained audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un dynamic duo by the end of the movie given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first it good knowin he out there the dude takin it easy posits the narrator towards the end dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken
susan granger review of hearts in atlantis castle rock warner bros timing is everything and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the coming of age nostalgia of stand by me with the mystical power of the green mile based on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks it set in 1960 in harwich connecticut where fatherless 11 year old bobby garfield anton yelchin lives in boarding house with his resentful self centered mother hope davis he devoted to his neighborhood friends mika boorem will rothhaar but his pivotal relationship is with strange new tenant ted brautigan anthony hopkins who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him birthday gift and hands him instead library card knowing he longing for schwinn bike ted offers to pay him $1 week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers the story structure consists of one long flashback framed by the present featuring the adult bobby david morse minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins mysterious character is genteel sensitive and benignly seductive the only explanation is that he psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate given the inexplicable state of the world right now the production values and performances are solid particularly hopkins arguably the finest most versatile actor of our era and the children with whom he forges firm bond on the granger movie gauge of to 10 hearts in atlantis is wistful enigmatic evolving with subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis
in 1994 an insider look at scandal ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination closely based on clinton 1992 campaign was written anonymously former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship now the book primary colors has been made into movie directed by mike nichols and in light of recent presidential scandals seems to be more relevant than ever but the film is more than diatribe against or paean in praise of the president it is fascinating look at the political machinery and the ethical quagmire that surround modern politics jack stanton john travolta is the governor of small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination he is charismatic but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign and strains his relationship with his wife susan emma thompson the film is told from the point of view of henry burton adrian lester grandson of civil rights leader who is swept away by stanton ideals and helps to organize the campaign he joins political strategist richard jemmons billy bob thornton looking an awful lot like james carville and campaign advisor daisy green maura tierney governor stanton past repeatedly pops up to haunt him fact that his chief rival lawrence harris kevin cooney consistently uses to his advantage to help clean up the stanton campaign jack and susan bring in an old friend libby the dustbuster holden kathy bates the acting throughout primary colors is superb it would be worth seeing the movie for bates wild performance alone she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in truly boisterous performance travolta does fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton although his accent does stray little emma thompson delivers strong performance as his suffering wife who can let anything show that might hurt the presidential run the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom primary colors treads lightly on this issue though stanton is clearly portrayed as democrat and there are few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans the movie touches on few actual political issues in fact most of the bad guys are fellow democrats on the same road to the beyaz house rather than issues the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control although the film strays into some obviously non clinton territory it is difficult to completely separate it from reality particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president current troubles primary colors chief problem is its length it runs about 15 minutes too long there are some scenes which could have easily been cut for example midway through the film the candidate gives speech to an assembly of laid off machinists the scene only apparent purpose is to establish stanton character which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film the extra length isn long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying but it mars an otherwise excellent film republicans democrats and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors it funny and at some times shocking look at the modern political process
jamaica is hot vacation spot the exchange rate encourages delusions of wealth approximately 30 jamaican dollars to one american the sea is brilliant mavi the air is warm but lacks humidity and as tourism is unfortunately jamaica biggest trade foreigners enter and leave with sense of relaxation life and debt takes brassy look at life inside this impoverished country while normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music this film guides the viewer with sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface the voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid it guides the audience along tourist journey and the story of the native inhabitants instead of telling you what you are already seeing on screen it quips you don see what happens after you flush the toilet this engages viewer to see and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there this strong sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film stephanie siyah is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals this isn just another talking head show of people moaning about their horrible lot in life people are interviewed from all sectors of occupation from field to factory as well as social theorists and the banking organizations that continue to invest in the country the variety of discussion perpetuates compelling internal dialogue with any viewer whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or not of course as can be expected the united states is slammed owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund and the world bank officials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaica economy will help the country back on its feet but only if they are willing to follow the advice word for word the next moment we see why and how each of these initiatives has failed usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whether or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend the is forcing on the citizens admittedly some of the back and forth between the business minded organizations and the failures they produce gets repetitive but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument but jamaica isn against the united states and this documentary does not accuse the of being the sole perpetrator of its grief if anything it begs for better understanding of the nature of jamaican society before stepping in to change it based on foreign regulations
one of the funniest carry on movies and the third with medical setting the main story is about dr james nookey jim dale who is disliked by his superiors frederick carver head of the hospital kenneth williams and dr ernest stoppidge charles hawtrey who seems to dislike everyone they attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible and all the blame is laid on nookey carver learns of possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore joan sims on distant tropical island and gets nookey trannsferred there when nookey arrives at this island he meets gladstone screwer sid james who has lived on the island just about all his life screwer is in possession of wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients dr nookey returns with the drug to england and sets up new slimming business with ellen moore financial backing however nookey and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on the drug and carver and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create rival drug the performances are all very commendable sid james has slightly ambiguous character to play this time and he excels in his role kenneth williams as usual plays the unpopular and cunning head of the hospital joan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey charles hawtrey plays an out of character role as dr stoppidge the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well but think that it at least gives hawtrey new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters as matter of fact hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part other regulars in the movie include hattie jacques as the matron yet again but this part is probably her most boring matron and barbara windsor as nookey love interest and unofficial women lib campaigner goldie locks both jacques and windsor play their parts well patsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell from steptoe and son fame and peter butterworth the jokes are mostly very funny the story is quite appealing and the regulars seem interested in what they re doing although it is another medical carry on movie and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies it still comes out on top it is the best medical carry on because of the above factors must see carry on movie

what surprises me most about the long awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis can hear batfans everywhere protesting first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker and indeed this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding oscar worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown romero played the joker in the 60s tv series on one hand nicholson joker is extremely funny his murderous escapades and manic outbursts which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film but on the other hand his outwardly jovial disposition is only mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind the joker cruelty and demented diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister this guy is off his rocker and he not only knows it he flaunts it but enough about nicholson as the joker sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman like many was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting keaton delivers he is convincing as the tormented millionaire bruce wayne and beneath his hard siyah body armor he is mysterious and formidable as the batman even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city visually batman is knockout nothing short of triumph for director tim burton and his production team the movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as the dark knight returns and the killing joke burton film is feast for the eyes the $35 million budget is definitely on the screen the sets costumes and make up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations nicholson isn joking when he boasts wait till they get load of me his grimacing smile green hair and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous keaton wardrobe is equally appropriate batman cape mask and body armor make him look threatening frightening and invincible bringing to mind not adam west campy costume in the tv series but peter weir outfit in robocop production designer anton furst sets are wonder gotham city is dark and foreboding almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york the batcave is cold bare and desolate the world that burton and furst have created in batman is melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption the movie gritty bladerunner robocop look is joy to behold the plot on the other hand is not as rousing the screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting it takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear batman tries to walk thin line between action and character psychology but it fails to give us enough of either one as mentioned earlier the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker but it never fully establishes batman psychological motives and underpinnings in terms of action batman is not as thrilling as you might expect burton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story more than anything batman is mood film while batman may not completely absorb and excite you it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books thanks to its distinctive look the movie like good comic book transports us to another world
we all know the fate of child play which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially sequel hell with the newest installment in the quasi popular series currently out that would be bride of chucky and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend which think is the sign of the apocalypse number five it kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original task which is retread for some and for others namely myself chance to see what all the fuss was about alas the original child play actually isn that bad even seeing it in the tiny claustrophobic and mechanically challenged theatre at my college wasn the horribly dull experience thought it would be not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd which you almost need to watch film like this and if you don believe me try and watch this flick by yourself one day but because as whole this isn bad movie it not great but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don have rather nifty premise and sense of humor both which save this from horror hell which is precisely where say know what you did last summer has recently gone the premise of child play is that serial killer named charles lee ray brad douriff is shot and almost killed by chicago hard boiled detective chris surrandon see what happens to some oscar nominees and before he dies utters voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into kid doll called chucky doll which has got to be the scariest looking kid doll ve ever seen the next day bum who stolen it sells it to single mother karen barclay catherine hicks who then gives it to her young son andy alex vincent for his birthday of course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find way to get out of the doll but certain twists come up like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll that being andy and soon enough chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun and people are discovering that chucky isn just kiddie doll one by one the idea is neat one ripe for lots of comic terror and luckily it utlizes lot of that it plays with an idea stolen from classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive they tell people about it but when he tries to prove themselves chucky does nothing and everyone thinks they re crazy it plays with this as well as the whole child like thought that dolls and toys come to life and even manages to cram in couple really frightening moments even if there an entire sequence devoted to cliches woman alone in house hears noise goes to investigate it and finds nothing but wait for the kicker second later there also harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience the ending is rather fun as well albeit tad too drawn out about four different endings maybe five and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line up making them easier to sympathize with if there one horrible thing about many horror films it that the protagonists are morons who you can help but shout obscenities at and for the most part child play steers away from that and most of all the chucky character is good one not just because he provides instant comic relief look that doll moving on its own but because he generally scary character if there anything really wrong with child play it that it too trite and has too less self esteem at almost 90 minutes child play features way too less to be real classic of horror it throws itself into simple three act set up that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it weren for the fact that the film deals with psychotic doll if the film had more confidence in what it was presenting it would really push the envelope and become even more than just short bit of horror escapism which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as cheap little horor film which isn necessarily bad thing as such child play is content to be just the short typical horror film but saves itself via sense of humor and nice quasi campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short typical horror film
natural born killers is really very simple story that in essence has already been told in bonnie clyde with some major variations in emphasis mood and degree both films glamorize outlaws in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers both relate the story of couple liberated by love but where bonnie clyde was partial and subtle natural born killers is total and blatant where bonnie clyde was social natural born killers is psychological what bonnie clyde hinted at natural born killers confronts and explores what bonnie and clyde stole mickey and mallory kill to examine natural born killers as nothing more than psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them expressed metaphorically as killing subdues the mysterious power this film wields for the most part when mickey and mallory kill they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily they kill what is trying to kill them they kill what dissembles and cowers from life they kill what needs to be killed this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity brahma created vishnu preserved and siva destroyed but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate forced to say it for clarity sake plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes that is destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics your plumber bonnie and clyde mickey and mallory and siva are all productive destroyers think you could say without much of challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death presently and historically than any other phenomena muslims kill christians hindus kill muslims christians kill pagans jews kill christians etc you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged religion is an orgy of killing the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn been major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable the state is the divine idea upon earth hegel said meaning it is absolute all powerful ineffable unassailable infallible authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh allah god etc well what does all this have to do with natural born killers let me first say that religions of this nature in the ideal take the place of sex consider the catholic church which in its hey dey took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope cardinals bishops monks etc they forego the one in order to come closer to the other during the middle ages when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power parenthetically witness plato as well in the republic he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime not coincidentally he was something of mystic himself regularly assailing the passions catholicism as policy attacks the passions as evil it sees intercourse only as means to perpetuate the species not as way to pleasure masturbation is considered sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution this is religion this is authoritarianism in its essence as further evidence the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters our culture most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years we can help but adopt even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes leading to destructive split between the biological and social self mickey and mallory knox internalized them too then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other discovered them and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves it is straightforward liberation through sex as some good patriarch once observed you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on m&m had vision of what the world would be like without contradictions they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions the moment of realization is worth thousand prayers as mickey says as the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter let us look each other in the face we are hyberboreans we know well enough how remote our place is neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans even pindar in his day knew that much about us beyond the north beyond ice beyond death our life our happiness we have discovered that happiness we know the way we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth who else has found it the man of today don know either the way out or the way in am whatever doesn know either the way out or the way in so sighs the man of today this is the sort of modernity that made us ill we sickened in lazy peace cowardly compromise the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay this tolerance and largeur of the heart that forgives everything because it understands everything is sirocco to us rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south winds as far as can tell this is what the movie has to say its alleged critique of the media is only secondary tertiary quaternary subsidiary for sure for example wayne gayle first report ends with some gen dude saying if were mass murderer be mickey and mallory in his most excellent bill and ted voice on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical impressionable gen dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he be just like them killing and destroying what deserves it let me exemplify what ve been saying by analyzing scene from the film namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant kills him and then castigates him for giving her the worst fuckin head ve ever had in my life now never claimed that mickey and mallory had perfect relationship because demonstrably they didn and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations but unwilling to kill each other since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation they must kill in place of their lever it no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey as the attendant approached he took on mickey character in the eyes of mallory she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory upon discovery mallory views this as betrayal judges him and commutes his sentence on someone else the style of the movie is whole nother matter that won get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of western with shots that linger forever on salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle the rapid succession of all those 8mm 16mm 35mm images from various perspectives with soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills skittish frenetic mood also jungian archetypes abound these can help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely few frames some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind quotes are paraphrased only mickey to mallory one of these days gonna be cummin for you in prison while mallory jacks mickey off semen is symbol for great potential and things to come at the time they haven yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet the two of course go hand in hand for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs mickey during his marriage to mallory as creator of my universe pronounce us man and wife the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting but telling too it reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones this is what mickey means by creator of my universe he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes it is not necessarily schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears scagnetti first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant mouth the indian sage releasing mallory father who was reincarnated as snake old man go be snake after telling his snake story that ends with bitch you knew was snake after mickey shoots this sage to death during bewildering nightmare mallory says you killed life this is another telling quote because it implies they didn see themselves as killers of life then what were they killing up to that time in some case just those zombies faking their way through life the living dead as it were in other cases all the anti life forces the cops and their parents the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison it of course symbolizes rebirth dr emil reingold as portrayed by steven wright passing judgement on m&m mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong they just don give damn this is reminiscent of nietzsche whole philosophy and maybe direct reference to his beyond good and evil mickey the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers mickey again in his interview me and you we are not the same species notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control mickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang the wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader no matter who it is mickey how ya feelin wayne fucking great mickey you got the feelin wayne alive alive for the first fuckin time what an incredible transformation this is he got the feeling and he couldn contain himself what feeling that feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe mickey when almost caught in dead end think think think think go figure it out dwight tommy lee jones in general because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film his whole attitude can be summed up with destroy them
some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find to their big surprise that the majority of people vote republican go to church every sunday and usually don tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film such rude awakening however can happen in another direction conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in something like that happens to jake van dorn george scott successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community one day his daughter kristen ilah davis disappears from calvinist youth convention in california van dorn is worried because he doesn believe that his daughter would run from home however the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast peter boyle is even harder kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast investigation is going so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself unfortunately he lacks experience and the quest that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld is fruitless things change when he devises cunning plan and while doing it stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky season hubley almost two decades after its release hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars it is real shame because very few movies in today hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt in late 1970s it was totally different situation films were expected to have mature serious themes for the mature audience for schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work taxi driver one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and instead of facing them prefers to live in rural conservative cocoons the new america on the other hand fares no better ideals of the so called sexual revolution same as all other revolutions of the swinging sixties degraded into exploitation and depravity instead of being liberated baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas actually aren so far away nice example is brilliant scene in which van dorn already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist meets sleazy porno producer the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian paternalistic and very dedicated to this job the difference between the two is simply in the line of work many contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda on the surface it may look that way audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest in the first scenes he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn deserve to experience parent worst nightmare the scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen fate is extremely cruel pain and humiliation brought by oscar winning actor george scott is of such intensity that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda van dorn is perhaps flawed and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end but the viewers simply know that his cause is just and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body on the other hand schrader who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn his own parents wouldn allow him to watch movies until he was 18 knows better and tries to bring another side of coin even the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities like nicky who actually tries to improve her life and sleazy detective who develops something like conscience at the end unfortunately schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich finale the script is slightly flawed and schrader as director doesn show too much originality his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver apart from the scenes in grand rapids those two films even look alike but the content might be more than interesting for today viewer especially those inspired by the current 70s revival until boogie nights no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s hardcore on the other hand might serve as precious document because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs before the advent of video when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists the view of such age and the industry is very unflattering though but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience that shouldn be too surprising anyway despite some flaws hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema
the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes and the greedy trade federation has used it armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo ruler the young queen amidala natalie portman to sign treaty giving the federation control however the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui gon jinn liam neeson and obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi and the first battle begins it seems that for me and thousands of people like me the love for george lucas trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time we re the fans not the freaks we won go dressing up like darth vader although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool and we won incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations not all the time anyway but if someone wants to challenge us to little trivia contest we re throwing down all right stop looking at me like that we have been faithfully and patiently waiting waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll you see the trilogy is not just set of movies but religion of sorts to we the faithful disciples and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah unfortunately it is not our savior for weeks beforehand was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good stupendously good miraculously good anything less and it ll be the biggest disappointment of the century didn want the doomsaying prophecy to come true really didn but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking character development is virtually nonexistent with the possible exception of qui gon most of the film characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions none seem very affected by their experiences and few even show any passion at all contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks creature belonging to race which lives in underwater cities on naboo in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala jar jar life is saved by qui gon early in the film and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh or supposedly so his speech mannerisms are so cute ified that couldn understand third of what he was saying and the slapstick he performed was just distracting his head gets caught in an electronic field his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast he describes being in trouble as deep doo doo and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport therein lies key difference between this film and one of its predecessors in star wars we had obi wan telling us mos eisley was wretched hive of scum and villainy in the phantom menace we get doo doo the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in story long time ago in galaxy far far away this film on the other hand constantly reminds me that it only movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during scene where young anakin skywalker enters into pod racing competition it kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses and there are couple of commentators in press box delivering indy 500 like play by play liked the pod race it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction this aspect coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all didn millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again didn the action figures still sell like hotcakes of course they did and it only poor judgment that allows the most eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed film with more appeal for adults one aspect that will appeal broadly however is the use of special effects the people at lucas industrial light and magic the world premiere effects house outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer generated images and real life footage some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed especially the shots of land battle between the federation robot army and jar jar countrymen the space battles are also impressive although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer this however is testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today john williams is back of course providing score for the film as only he can his music is pervasive throughout as rousing and as dramatic as ever always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately since this film is supposed to be the first installment in nine episode story star wars the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four five and six respectively the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar as result attention to history and characterization was spread little thin it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi wan for example but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films one of the new characters is darth maul hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film release in spite of the hype darth maul is character which almost didn have to be in the film his role is so insignificant he has maybe three spoken lines believe it or not second actor voices the character and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean with that working against him he never has chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe something which has been prominent throughout however he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible offering an easy out for story writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with real life connection oddly while trying to capitalize on spirituality lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force loving parasites in your body cells this only serves to de mystify the workings of the force few notches by offering scientific connection don let me mislead you too far the phantom menace by most standards is good film it contains lot of visual treats sets the stage for an epic story gives us bit of excitement here and there and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends it just that when held up to it predecessors and to not do so would be unrealistic this film simply pales
for the first reel of girls town you just can get over lili taylor is it possible to remain unperturbed that woman of this age is playing high school student harder still can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part with the sure showy expertise of de niro taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck you confidence she can muster it deeply felt dead on performance and by the halfway point you ve forgiven taylor her own maturity for all its verite pretenses girls town is less about bunch of high schoolers than it is about movie director and cadre of writer performers examining their own feelings about rape relationships and american womanhood the movie opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between group of four smart sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation patti angela bruklin harris emma anna grace and nikki aunjanue ellis but about 10 minutes into the film we get word that nikki has swallowed fistful of pills and bowed out of life the remaining girls manage to smug nikki diary out of her grieving mother home and page through it at patti place investigating the root of nikki despair what they find is cruel and galvanizing nikki had been raped by an editor at newspaper where she interned and was privately questioning the sanity and value of world where such thing could happen shell shocked by the truth of the matter the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to realization about their own lives emma says she was raped last year on date with football player patti barely sympathetic wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in jock car and anyway patti had her own share of guys who wouldn take no for an answer pained acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry angry about the impossibility of saying no and angry with themselves for being weak for being naive for putting up with it why do we put up with it emma finally asks once the argument has reached fever pitch we try to talk about it and look what happens we fight for 20 minutes there the admirable crux of this picture girls town is political film in that it calls for action but it incomplete it never quite sure how to justify that action or what form it should take the trio become crusaders for their right to dignity and it surely one of this year most stirring movie moments when emma lobs concrete block through the passenger side window of that damn jock car doing the right thing they hang out in the bathroom chatting incessantly and scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to toilet stall subvert the patriarchy emma writes and then starts hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to the girls silence their hecklers take revenge on the deadbeat father of patti child and eventually come face to face with nikki tormentor still the movie has desperately unfinished quality and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying you keep waiting for someone to call the cops on these brazen girls but nobody thinks of it perhaps searching for resolution missing from the material at hand the film borrows its epigraphs from audre lorde and queen latifah who you callin bitch the points are well taken but they should have been unnecessary long on characterization but little short on story girls town is less than it could have been and too self congratulatory for my own taste director jim mckay is best known as consort of michael stipe he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that band and girls town is his first foray into feature filmmaking the movie was created and scripted by committee but mckay and his lead performers had to shoot on shoestring when predictably the group couldn secure funding then again girls town on budget would hardly be the same film the movie slapdash quality is key to its significance truth be told all three of the leads look too wise for high school but that ok there once removed quality to their fine spontaneous performances as the women take very skillful look back at the girls they once were the girls they wish they had been or some combination for all its flaws this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head and heart in the same noble place
big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america simpson tom capano the menendez brothers all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms and of course courtroom dramas are not new topic to hollywood whether it be john grisham thrilling novels or television famous dramas the courtroom has always provided big bucks so when rented civil action was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat however what saw in civil action was far different from what expected major surprise but fortunately pleasant one john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it no one expected him to light up the screen in grease nor in saturday night fever but whenever he gets knocked down he always seems to come back fighting civil action is not john best performance but strong one that could rival any performance in 1998 travolta proves that normal and believable performance can vault film into oscar nominations his performance is not flashy nor memorable just solid if he delivered the only solid performance this film would still be average luckily he has strong supporting cast william macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood he continues to deliver great performances one after the other but he is still regarded as secondary actor in civil action he delivers yet another great performance as travolta paranoid and greedy accountant he is not lovable character but character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film he is not one of the big time lawyers just measly accountant but he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 but there is actually someone better in civil action robert duvall is also an underrated actor he gets many leading roles but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks brad pitt and jim carrey duvall has supporting role in this as lawyer of the co defendant duvall is magical in this role he is the wise teacher who not only battles it out in the courtroom but also manages to teach every major player lesson in his own twisted way in many non comedic films directors are always trying to find way to implement touch of comedy to keep the audience on their toes unfortunately they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny jar jar binks anyone however this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed this is not the case in civil action they have comedy coming from all sides whether it be duvall inane questions or macy sharp anger the laughs come in steady pace granted it not roll in the aisle funny but it provides nice addition to the film the plot is terrific somewhat the setup is nice with the film actually starting with victory in the courtroom then the case that will make or break jan travolta career rears its ugly head they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it however budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt will not spoil the rest although must speak of the one downside to the film the courtroom debates are great but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored it left me somewhat confused although the rest of the film is terrific all in all john travolta is back yet again in this great film his supporting cast consisting of macy and duvall turn in tremendous performances which ease the load on travolta the film is smart witty and thought provoking not only does it gauge in court battles but also the various tolls it can take on the major players civil action provides everything drama lover craves
frequent error is the categorization of terrorist as soldier or common criminal soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation state against another common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain terrorist employs random violence as means to political end if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy the violence continues it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone even total innocents anywhere at anytime that gives the figure his label edward zwick the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states you think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad and the responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack however unlike the real life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden camp and manufacturing facility the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal in retaliation the terrorists bring the fight to the new world unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent in charge anthony hubbard denzel washington who works out of the bureau new york office at one federal plaza while investigating series of bombings in the big apple he encounters cia agent elise kraft annette bening also trying to uncover information generally the fbi is charged with problems inside the while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory but as the two form tentative professional relationship hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government the original tagline for patriot games was there has never been terrorist attack on american soil however true it was pulled before the movie release because it sounded too much like dare revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states the siege is almost an invitation in itself because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america admittedly the terror wrought upon new york is bit excessive who going to believe that few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of bus or to curtail their shopping by two thirds but the basic premise is still valid liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action thriller fare of good guy men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order it provides very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of few arabs would escalate into series of hate crimes against the arab american population and that in an effort to find the terrorists the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself in fact about halfway through the film when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city the liberties of all americans are put at risk although it may actually be side effect of terrorist campaign the demise of social order in america is scary thought and goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups throughout the film maintains conflict between hubbard who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law and general devereaux bruce willis who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully what results is fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides it actually gets rather heady at times but it credit to screenwriters zwick lawrence wright and menno meyjes that they don underestimate the intelligence of the audience don know if it his tone or inflection or something else but denzel washington has way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great this combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid level authority figure makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of female character ve seen recently and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable it somewhat unfortunate that her character fortitude is broken at certain point but it allows us to watch bening play little more range bruce willis is pretty much relegated to tough guy role always standing straight and with permanent scowl fixed upon his face however the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is major drive behind the film development notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad lebanese immigrant the role calls for evidencing both kind of filial pride for his heritage and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society difficult to say the least shalhoub does it with naturalness you can almost reach out and touch perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom wings shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick favorite actor he directed washington in glory and courage under fire james horner seems to be his favorite composer therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score writer graeme revell seven films this year already over horner for the siege until realized that this film contained lot of arabian themed music and horner record has shown more of propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish sounding at most revell does good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as whole it nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we ve been getting throughout the year missteps in the siege can be found in couple of the excesses it takes for example it pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick unfortunately there scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in blatant display of firepower and explosions obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye catching in the middle of the city and against no real opposition zwick even has the army use cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point the film also gets little preachy toward the end focusing on the ability of different races to get along noble gesture the film just puts the message across bit too obviously these flaws are glaring but they don detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class
seen september 1998 at 10 at the sony nickelodeon theaters boston ma theater #2 with matt perreault for free using my sony loews critic pass [theater rating okay seats sound and picture] modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before from teenage sitcoms to nc 17 rated films about fetishes the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it your friends and neighbors takes different approach as it film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within small circle of friends one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as whole is writer director neil labute basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story firstly and most importantly is the fact the script tells rather complex detailed story of lust betrayal arrogance hypocrisy greed and just plain stupidity between six different characters three men three women without hardly any supporting characters few have line or two mostly extras everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full circle back to themselves whether it be positive or negative but to just state this is arbitrary and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult labute ability to tell his story through few characters is remarkable feat but what specifically impressive is the fact the characters names are never revealed until the end credits roll for the sake of this review will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus we re always able to tell where the characters are someone home the gym restaurant hotel room etc but what the city they live in what year it is what the society is like etc is relatively unknown the film is complete character study with the tight intense drama of the theater no one plot dominates the story which makes the first act bit tedious for its lack of background we re simply dropped in on the characters lives and are expected to figure out the rest the characters are group of middle class beyaz people who are all successful at what they do but they re only concern right now seems to be their sex lives first there barry eckhart and mary brenneman married couple who are going through dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don know what they re problem is barry is kind of dorky businessman who loves his wife and the sex they have but doesn have lot of ambition he just follows everyone else mary is writer of some sort but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character but ironically doesn hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something labute script does good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two obviously this is the theme which is enhanced by the actors good performances but at the same time seems just bit hollow another couple is jerry stiller and terri keener who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for long time yet they constantly argue over anything and everything their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship if only one aspect of the film could use improvement it would be this area it natural for married couple to become bored with each other but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together what did they ever see in the other person to begin with labute never really answers but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process it still makes for good drama tension and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it fascinating two other characters act as catalysts cary jason patric and cheri natassja kinski cary is an arrogant hostile sex maniac who defines the word bastard somehow he is able to bend women to his will either through charm or just attitude into getting his way he the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he secretly perverted but somehow barry finds comfort in his company although jerry is always nervous around him patric gives an outstanding performance so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is cheri is character labute uses as catalyst to see how the other characters react to her she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different from becoming involved in relationship with one to brushing it off as small talk with another to being outright appalled by yet another she sweet woman perhaps the most normal of any of the characters and although her symbolism is obvious her role as the outsider is the most relatable will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others action as that the hook of the film the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each scenarios but it often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom the result is sometimes surprising other times predictable but the actual course of actions is always fascinating for while everyone has their fun but ultimately each character guilt attitude or ignorance will disserve them one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be since the characters only interact with each other there isn much pop culture references as almost everything has deeper philosophy behind it are we to assume that these people are as the title states our friends and neighbors don know of anyone going through the same situations as these people often times the film is not unlike network melodrama other times situations are like those not seen outside porno movie but what this film does have that the others don is repercussions in the end although the film creates its own reality it goes to show that even the immoral aren immortal in what way your friends and neighbors is supposed to work is open to interpretation it definitely has lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically still it an accomplishment in film making because it has put timeless theme into modern perspective
some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen finished mike figgis leaving las vegas hours ago and it is still as haunting as when hit rewind on the vcr alot of people refer to this film as that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude leaving las vegas is not so much movie about alcoholism as it is story about two people who except each other for what they are drunk and whore ben nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years is the drunk his family and friends have long since abandon him and all he has left is his liquor in scene early in the film we see ben staggering into resteraunt looking for friend of his to mooch some money off of he finds the guy richard lewis having dinner with buddy and two chicks trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid when ben approaches the table you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable after lewis gives ben the money he coldly says think it would be best if you didn contact me again now even though through the course of the film some much more depressing things happen this is when felt the most for ben there was such look of sorrow and dispare on his face not to sound hokey or anything it almost brought tear to my eye it turns out that ben was once semi successful hollywood player and apparently pretty popular guy now he spends his time getting robbed by hookers and trying desperatly to pick up women not so much for the sex but for the company for someone to talk to or spend time with once he is fired from his job ben decides to burn all his belongings collect all his cash and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death one night he runs into prostitute brilliant performance by elizabeth shue how far she has come since adventures in babysitting named sera she is involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp scumbag who gets off by cutting her they are both very lonely self destructive people they immediatly hit it off both of them realizing that they need one another and it isn even sexual relationship they don even have sex until like the last ten minutes of the film leaving las vegas is not film about plot with the exception of what have already revealed which all happens in the first thirty minutes or so by the way there isn too much of story to it it is more film about people and how they react to one another from what can see this is basically perfect film the direction is great with mike figgis doing brilliant mix between the glamor of las vegas and the moody smokey atmosphere of film noir and it contains two of the best performances to come out of the 90s or any other decade for that matter but don go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what you re getting yourself into first off if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge stay away from leaving las vegas it is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms rape and various forms of perverted activities involving burbon that right secondly if you are not in the mood to see very depressing film don see it however if you are cool with those two things you are in for one of the most memorable experiences you will ever have
warning to those who have not seen seven this review contains some spoiler information seven is powerful fully realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs it is disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled while this film is not for the squeamish there is no denying that seven demands attention for it is film that transcends its genre in both style and substance for starters classifying seven as thriller would not be an altogether complete classification of this film while was genuinely thrilled throughout would rather call seven an intense drama because that is what it delivers meaningful scenes with relentlessness that does not readily let up part of director david finchers accomplishment is in style he seems to have knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as simple as corpse and visually fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all too realistic and graphic terms courtesy of rob bottin always grisly special effects throw in the appropriate but not to be underestimated effects of lighting and foreboding score and the result is technical masterpiece of the murder scene these scenes alone are quite impressive as fascinating as they are harrowing yet seven is more than just technical accomplishment in addition to style fincher supplies substance seven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand and fincher ties them all together in completely pessimistic view of society detective william somerset morgan freeman is man who has nearly given up on the world its easy to see why the world doesn make sense somerset drives this point home with rather ghastly story of robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct after knocked down and robbed of his wallet the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes why should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and picking up the pieces he will be able to catch the killer somersets new partner david mills brad pitt has not given up on the world perhaps because he is still young and perhaps by having this optimism he naive in this films portrayal of the world he completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope however david wife gwyneth paltrow has so much fear of her urban surroundings she isn even sure if she wants to tell her husband about her recent pregnancy let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment these three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters lesser film might have offered and in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world fincher gives us support for why they feel the way they do but if there one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey it has to be the killer john doe kevin spacey seven payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does one important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as psycho with no motives behind his slayings this is exactly the mistake mills makes in the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes were allowed to see that doe is in his mind merely product of society he killer who kills those who are bringing society down in his mind he didn kill innocent people and perhaps they were not completely innocent but then again who is hes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent really seven doesn just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed up john doe is seven makes larger statements about how screwed up society is hinting that society degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does besides the stylistic and larger issue arguments for seeing this film recommend seven because it is after all also very slick and well made thriller it features exciting plot developments commanding performances lots of suspense and conclusion that is chilling riveting and quite unfair but then again its cruel world

anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia wearing brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes deep vibrant colors and an epic storyline it true beauty comes from it subtle ruminations on the politics of power whether it between governments or the interplay between man and woman anna jodie foster is widowed british schoolteacher with touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband with son in tow she takes the employ of king mongkut chow yun fat to tutor his son in the english language mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world anna function is to help provide that link the core of the film of course deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of shifting political climate foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide eyed wonder she is assertive yet respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him it is one of foster strongest performances since silence of the lambs in role she could not have played earlier in her career she brings mature self awareness and determination that might not have come across from younger foster it joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut monarchy when she makes her entrance into politically charged banquet mid film she exudes hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance chow yun fat king mongkut is every measure of foster anna perhaps even more so this is the chow yun fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years he is imposing yet vulnerable playful but stern it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance precious time is stolen from the movie 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king concubines bai ling and her love of commoner it strikes with the subtlety of siam fabled beyaz elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie although bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film it fits within the established subplot of perceived siege by neighboring burma country backed by the british anna and the king transcends being predictable traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness it shows seduction of intelligence ever mindful of each other positions anna and king mongkut negotiate maze of social customs conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying if not achingly bittersweet
film adaptation of hunter thompson infamous semi autobiographical hallucinogen fueled book of the same title director terry gilliam of twelve monkeys 10 and brazil 10 fame took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox sid and nancy 10 apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie according to gilliam plot writer thompson depp heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr gonzo del toro to cover motorcycle race during their trip they systematically consume two bags of grass seventy five pellets of mescaline five sheets of high powered blotter acid salt shaker half full of cocaine whole galaxy of multi colored uppers downers screamers laughers quart of tequila quart of rum case of beer pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls the movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use critique have given this movie two separate ratings because believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer own mind whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess if you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on multitude of colorful levels if on the other hand you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug induced picture entire ride 10 for all those sober dogs note have not read thompson book having said that joblo did engage in an alcohol based consumatory session before and during the viewing of this film so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level this movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour rather than substance or plot it moves admirably from one scene to the next without much basis of their being while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine it was 1971 and the times were apparently changing in the states johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on chocolate lollipop during the filming depp apparently become fast friends with real life writer thompson and was known to wander off the set from time to time for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk little bit too much but then again this movie is supposed to be wild exaggeration of everything and anything so who am to talk the one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr gonzo couldn believe that this fat samoan lawyer was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects 10 word on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role and must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible plenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin christina ricci tobey maguire and cameron diaz along with bunch of others other than that the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic the style was not as wild as thought it would be and the ending was certainly not much of barn burner but then again who really noticed this movie is about visions of bats floating through your head johnny depp looking goofy and being bald and the cornucopia of drug ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy rebellion and the lost american dream and for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of mean drink or mighty doobie suggest you move further down the aisle buy yourself ticket to godzilla 10 and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind little known facts depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine bill murray also portrayed thompson based character in the film where the buffalo roam johnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers speed 10 and legends of the fall 10 for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon 10 and what eating gilbert grape 10 in 1988 depp told rolling stone magazine that he tried every drug by the age of 14 johnny hung out with some of the members of oasis while filming the uncompleted divine rapture in ireland and later played some slide guitar on the 1997 album be here now johnny was born in kentucky is high school dropout has nicknamed himself mr stench has been engaged to four women until now including actress winona ryder whose winona forever tattoo had to be altered to wino forever after their breakup currently plays guitar in band called and owns the viper room nightclub in
true faith and its expression through organized religion is difficult subject for motion picture to tackle head on which is probably why so few of them do it even the most religious directors like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms so it not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get the apostle onto the big screen as matter of fact even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money he also wrote the script directed the film and starred as the central character fiery texas preacher named euliss sonny dewey few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial technical and creative responsibility single handedly and it testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall and thankfully every bit of that personal investment translates on screen into power and honest emotion sonny is an energetic pentecostal preacher who has been speaking actually shouting from behind the pulpit since he was twelve he spends much of his time traveling about the country evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers sonny is not phony or swindler and the film purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says although like all humans he has weaknesses one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that not only does his long suffering wife jessie farrah fawcett want to leave him for another man in the congregation but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher faced with the loss of two things he loves passionately his church and his family that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into violent temper at his son baseball game sonny snaps and smashes his wife lover in the face with baseball bat inflicting wound that may be fatal not knowing what else to do sonny disappears he throws away his identification drives his car into lake and takes bus to louisiana hoping to start over again in the tiny mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte sonny once again finds his calling after befriending simple auto mechanic walt goggins and tracking down the town ex minister john beasley sonny sets up his own church the one way to heaven temple re christening himself as the apostle he quickly draws together an eager congregation and together they realize real change in each other lives but always sonny past is lurking step behind him waiting to swallow his progress duvall has made his intentions in making the apostle clear in recent article in newsweek he wrote filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such strong emphasis on the holy spirit and when they do it tends to be patronizing full of charlatans and snake handlers but what really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe and to portray it in an accurate way the strength of duvall convictions turn out to be the strength of his film the apostle always rings true even in the most painful moments because we know he being sincere with the subject matter after fifteen years of traveling the country listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual his sonny is man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to ve always called you jesus and you ve always called me sonny he says when neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs sonny mother june carter cash just hangs up on them because she knows there no sense trying to interrupt him the main theme to emerge from the apostle is the fact that good can come from any situation sonny act of violence toward another human being is inarguably horrific thing and duvall never shrinks from that fact however that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him in his short time in louisiana he does world of good and when the police finally show up to take him away he goes quietly knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him and as scene during the final credits shows he even turns his punishment into positive opportunity for change and betterment it is that strength in sonny character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others he is flawed but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves watching duvall on screen it not hard to imagine that he would have been magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting as sonny he completely inhabits the character and his performance is certainly the best of the year because he spent so much time absorbing the traits methods quirks and personalities of real preachers duvall was able to create complete character who always feels indelibly human as director duvall feels that less is more his camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it with very little intrusion there are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive close ups duvall knew that the power of the film characters enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly non professional churchgoers and actual ministers didn need to be artificially enhanced in this way the apostle almost plays out like documentary not only in its technical simplicity but more importantly in its sense of reality
driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell small intimate story it quiet film slow film deliberate film but if you re patient with it the movie offers innumerable rewards such as pair of self assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry pulitzer prize winning play of the same name which first opened in new york four years ago the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago los angeles london vienna norway and the soviet union uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy he also penned the wonderful sleeper mystic pizza the film like the play is set in atlanta georgia and it revolves around two people in their twilight years cranky 70 something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and 60 something siyah man who becomes her chauffeur the movie relies on character rather than plot to propel the action in fact the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense it doesn present linear story in which all the scenes flow together rather driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life shopping listening to the radio visiting the cemetery eating fried chicken and so on the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta history including the 1958 bombing of the temple the city oldest jewish congregation and 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr martin luther king jr the story begins in 1948 with daisy tandy crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway the insurance company cancels her insurance and her son boolie decides to hire her chauffeur freeman reprising his role from the play plays the chauffeur hoke the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger driving miss daisy is movie about human nature aging prejudice and great many other things but more than anything it about relationship one that spans 25 years cars the advent of civil rights and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon daisy is strong willed and set in her ways and from the outset she is utterly opposed to the idea of having chauffeur initially she treats hoke with contempt refusing to let him drive her anywhere once she does get in the car daisy is the ultimate back seat driver to make matters worse she is extremely self conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by hired hand eventually however daisy is worn down by hoke good natured charm and infectious cheer she softens and opens up to him tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well but unfortunately this feisty cantankerous character is just smidgen too commonplace we ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations from on golden pond to cocoon nevertheless tandy manages to put enough of personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own freeman as hoke on the other hand gives the more distinctive of the two performances there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color hoke is uneducated and illiterate but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element in full command of their natural charisma they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves they bring light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie gentle humor at the same time tandy and freeman provide more than few moments of truly poignant drama in his first dramatic role dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie tandy loving and patient son drama seems to agree with aykroyd taking break from comedy seems like good move for the actor especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ghostbusters ii the great outdoors my stepmother is an alien the only other significant characters in the film are daisy housekeeper idella marvelously played by esther rolle good times and boolie pretentious wife played by patti lupone under the direction of bruce beresford crimes of the heart tender mercies driving miss daisy seems bit stagey now and again but fortunately beresford never forgets he shooting movie and accordingly he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches such as gorgeous shots of flowers trees and tomatoes in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen the filmmakers have achieved delicate subtlety uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say beresford wisely exercises restraint in the film dramatic moments the movie tugs at your heart but it never goes for the jugular the only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees
was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars from my first viewing noticed that david mamet film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning from my second viewing however noticed that mamet script was actually masterpiece the spanish prisoner like the usual suspects or chinatown begs for the viewer complete attention miss scene or even small detail and you could miss the meaning of the entire film also like the aforementioned films it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering surprising and memorable ending mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games like his past gem the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much or even more than the victim because we were deceived just like the victim we feel strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film mamet has the talent of not completely ending film gift wrapped but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end the power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over without giving right answer is unique and ingenious the spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued after seeing the film again noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening his direction is very subtle as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them or think you see all of them the story follows young up and coming businessman joe ross campbell scott who has just created mysterious and lucrative process that everyone is trying to get their hands on soon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his process through his journey ross meets number of mysterious characters the rich and popular jimmy dell secretary who has huge crush on ross and ross boss mr klein played by steve martin rebecca pidgeon and ben gazarra respectively the supporting cast is very solid especially martin who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role the most interesting character in the film though was campbell scott joe ross the character transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable david mamet script is so interesting because we know people don actually talk like the characters in the film yet we feel so connected to some of them his beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge this is must see for those interested in solving complex puzzle of movie
there thin line between satire and controversy and mike nichols the birdcage wolf has directed sharp and very honest look at us presidential election based on the book written by anonymous actually former newsweek writer joe klein john travolta plays governor jack stanton but he doesn actually play stanton he plays bill clinton just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville although the credits will of course say otherwise the film is taken from the perspective of henry burton adrian lester morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton he searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations and whether it be keeping the history of his boss pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician he approaches his work with keen desire to skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers richard jemmons billy bob thorton and daisy green maura tierney team up with henry as the would be president advisors and hire lesbian veteran libby holden kathy bates as the campaign eccentric tougher than dirt incriminator together they face all sorts of sexual allegations the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race in its satire and controversy primary colors is similar film to wag the dog they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nitty gritty and take bold look at something that will never has honesty as virtue but whereas wag showed us how much affect few people can have on the media primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out it characters letting us understand what they want and why and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth look and the rest of the cast also make superb performances adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden at occasions you can help but feel that these terrific characters are going to waste there are long slabs of time where john travolta unquestionably the most interesting to watch is missed from the screen and since it is awkwardly structured as henry story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot or even the point of the film having said that make no mistake primary colors is always enjoyable to watch but frequently we have to ask ourselves exactly what are we watching most of the first half of its duration is lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help but laugh but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects that are very contrary and almost unsuitable to the rest of the film but as mentioned before there is thin line between satire and controversy and for the most part primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with far from overpowering look at winning the public opinion although at occasions the film may jump around little too freely focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is thankfully it is clear to make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is provocative documentation of something so really it scary
guess there are those who have never been kissed before rare and dying breed except if you re child in which case it would be called experimenting rarer still are those who have never been kissed before they reach the twenties hardest to believe still is that drew barrymore has never been kissed despite all these hard to believe tit bits there are people out there who have never truly been kissed and who are still waiting for that right person to give them the wet sloppy warm feeling of tongues intermingling reassuring them that their search for true love is over well this movie is about girl waiting for the right boy to give her the kiss of her life and it sweet drew barrymore who shone in ever after is wonderful as josie grossy the high school dweeb who becase professional editor before being assigned by her paper to return to school as an undercover reporter it addresses the issues of how dweeb becomes prom queen and finds the man of her life all in one sitting hard to believe but possible there may also be those who have been kissed before but in fact never truly been given the kiss so this movie can be watched by those who are waiting for true love or those who are still searching for it either way it is one enjoyable sit with fairytale ending
buffalo 66 is very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci gallo plays very troubled man who was sent to jail for gambling once out of jail he must visit his parents who he told he was married the truth is he isn married to try to impress them he kidnaps girl christina ricci from tap dancing class to act as his wife the film is very cheaply made and it shows it throughout lot of the movie but you don need money to make good film buffalo 66 doesn always stay with the realistic concept and sometimes goes through outrageous events gallo parents played by angelica huston and ben gazarra are two very strange individuals the mother plays football fanatic and the father plays quiet man with odd habits gallo and ricci arrive at his parent house and some extremely funny scenes take place within the house ricci performance during the scene at gallo parent home are very well done there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative they seemed very mediocre but they worked out just fine gallo character is developed very well the impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear gallo gives performance that makes you believe what the character is going through his character goes through many many problems just like many people in real life this character seemed very realistic to me ricci character is funny and different she doesn care much that she has been kidnaped in fact she falls in love the man who kidnaped her ricci is very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves buffalo 66 isn all laughs though many scenes are very dramatic and depressing gallo character was so realistic he was extremely disturbing some scenes are supposed to come off as funny but they actually seemed sad and real to life the film sometimes drags along not giving much material really would have liked to see gallo parents lot more and would have liked to see the characters developed more overall buffalo 66 isn as good as some people put it up to be the bottom line few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom
every once in while film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise don necessarily mean in terms of quality rather referring to the mere knowledge of its existence usually know what films are on the way year in advance but two weeks ago had never heard of princess caraboo it has slipped rather quietly into limited release and appears destined to slip out just as quietly that shame because princess caraboo is delightful fable romantic gentle and very appealing what more it surprisingly insightful and provides sharp witted lesson in english social history princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england involving young woman phoebe cates who is found wandering the countryside apparently unable to speak any english she is taken in by good hearted gentlewoman mrs worrall wendy hughes her banker husband jim broadbent is none too pleased about this strange houseguest until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island the princess caraboo this development inspires plans for lucrative trading venture for mr worrall and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs worrall however local journalist john gutch stephen rea is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo as social satire and comedy of manners princess caraboo is winner it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr worrall drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude he is worse than one of the idle rich he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them and since the house and money are all from mrs worrall he is bit too close to them for comfort while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule director and co writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light hearted to be heavy handed he also takes unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes as the princess becomes sensation at court in one of the film best sequences princess caraboo is the guest of honor at party hosted by the prince regent wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions and the lords and ladies end up following her around in thoroughly silly native dance it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in sensations an idea that takes on timeless quality and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show social commentary aside princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment the performers are mostly delightful particularly phoebe cates who is radiant in part that requires gift for pantomime her supporting players are also appealing wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs worrall kevin kline as frixos the worralls suspicious and superior greek butler stephen rea as the world weary but ultimately romantic gutch only john lithgow is disappointment turning in limp performance as scholar who attempts to verify the princess identity the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really princess is always in some doubt without becoming gimmicky it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn given more time to develop because the potential seemed to be there when it finally does blossom it seems too quick to be plausible princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem bit slow to viewers seeking fantasy romp still it has both escapist and intellectual appeal and is well worth seeking out it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding hidden gem
airplane is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film making after all it brought to us by one of the best known satire writing directing teams even if most people don recognize the names behind the films they are bound to recognize the titles airplane top secret the naked gun and hot shots to name few but although the zucker abrahams zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 airplane remains the true cornerstone of their work and their directorial debuts in the seventies disaster films seemed to be at an all time high films like earthquake the towering inferno and the poseidon adventure were big hits there was also series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane series that spanned the entire decade and so in 1980 we were introduced to new airplane disaster film this time the disaster had nothing to do with maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean it had to do with bad fish airplane is the story of ted striker robert hays an ex fighter pilot who has never gotten over the fact that decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six er seven comrades unable to stop living in the past ted world fell apart he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having stable job and eventually as we begin this film is getting dumped by his lover flight attendant elaine dickinson julie hagerty in desperate attempt not to lose her ted buys ticket for the same flight elaine is working unfortunately she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her which leaves him wallowing in self pity in the midst of it all something happens someone gets sick then another then another soon the whole plane is full of deathly ill chicago bound people and when the pilots get sick played by peter graves kareem abdul jabbar and frank ashmore who will save the day gee wonder of course the main draw here is the non stop whiz bang comedy with hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags although had seen this movie few times before was still laughing thru the entire thing the most fun character by far is the doctor played by leslie nielsen he dry subtle sterotypically straight faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film in film like this you re not really expecting an elaborate production so one can complain about the amateurish quality what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny played by stephen stucker this character is pointless nauseating and very unfunny don know why he was put in there and don think anybody will find good excuse and when the film nears an end it slows down quite bit almost getting old you gotta give it to movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long aside from that airplane is really top notch spoof that will likely forever be known as spoof classic it would be good choice to pop in the vcr with group of friends especially if they haven seen it and if they ask what the plot is just tell em it synopsis of the basic storyline of the film but that not important right now if you ve seen the film you ll understand
the farrelly brothers third film after dumb and dumber 10 and kingpin 10 brings together the real life couple of cameron diaz and matt dillon some nasty humour cute dog and mix of love fate and romance plot high school nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks him to the prom unfortunately for ted he accidentally gets part of his male anatomy ouch caught in his zipper and misses the big night thirteen years later ted still can get mary out of his mind and hires private detective dillon to find her once found it turns out that mary has more than one suitor and that when the real fun begins critique likeable comedy with few extremely funny scenes some funny looking people and plot that won ever put you to sleep having said that must admit that did like the farrellys two previous films more than this one but that is saying lot since really did love those earlier pics this one is also quite funny but it didn really blow me away like the others then again maybe my expectations were too high then again maybe should shut up and write little more about the film and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking disliking the film continuing where their other pictures left off the farrellys create cutesy world of people with strange and endearing qualities and simple plot by which to tie them all together this one also includes plenty of toilet humour but also some borderline fun making of the disabled and mentally challenged must admit that really wasn sure whether to laugh at some points or not not good place to be having said that the scenes that did tear through the audience and yours truly were extremely hilarious and went on for several minutes after the punchline the laughter practically killed out the next scene for one of the best ones in the movie something to do with hair gel on the negative end did not like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through the entire picture found them quite useless unfunny and distracting also found that lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the film trailer and of course never quite buy the fact that these beautiful intelligent single women still can seem to find the right guy see kiss the girls 10 did really like all of the actors in the film especially ben stiller who appears to be solidifying his mark as great comical actor with this picture and one of my favourites from 1996 flirting with disaster 10 also liked matt dillon with his big teeth and lee evans with his superb faux sympathy british accent funny stuff also make sure that you stay for the credits because there is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under lip synched version of build me up buttercup which is really cool overall cute comedy with decent premise and few particularly hilarious scenes little known facts the farrellys big break came when they somehow got copy of their script dust to dust into the hands of eddie murphy via murphy neighbour they only found out about murphy interest when they saw eddie mention the script on the david letterman show one night matt dillon is high school dropout in between acting gigs dillon has branched out into the restaurant business close to home in his native new york he co owns both bar called the whiskey and swanky uptown eatery called the falls cameron diaz stands started working as model at the early age of 16 and loves cats ben stiller father is jerry stiller he played george costanza jason alexander father on tv seinfeld peter farrelly has written novel entitled outside providence which is currently being filmed starring alec baldwin rob moran who plays the cop in this film also played the millionaire bowler in kingpin and the bartender in dumb and dumber he is old friends with the farrelly brothers from college and is currently married to entertainment tonight anchor correspondant julie moran harland williams who plays the nutty hitchhiker in this film also played state trooper in the farrelly earlier dumb and dumber and was the star of the unfortunate rocket man
the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam fitting since the media saturated gulf war became pop entertainment while driving through long flat iraqi desert in humvee with bart simpson hood ornament one of the men under special forces sgt maj archie gates who steering command requests beach boys tune these men want their apocalypse now moment only instead of surfing they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle armed with automatic rifles our three kings okay four are good fighters but they don necessarily take operation desert storm seriously it reprieve from their hellish day jobs they are gates new father sgt troy barlow wahlberg sgt chief elgin cube and pvt conrad vig music video director jonze at story start president bush has declared ceasefire and american troops are tying up loose ends barlow elgin and vig discover during round up of iraqi captives an ass map that points to bunker filled with altin bullion gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation he proposes demands that barlow elgin and vig join him on treasure hunt ditching his escort relentless reporter named adriana cruz nora dunn is easy so is finding the treasure until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq saddam men are threatening the dictator detractors citizens of his own country with violence when gates and company arrive at the bunker with stolen truck ready to loot the unarmed rebels want help bush encouraged them to rise up against the government but provided no military support for such cause gates convinces the vault guards that this is post war mission and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck the situation could go off without hitch the former enemies bear no grudges but the money hungry gates has conscience and when one female bystander is shot by sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene he orders barlow elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces the result barlow is kidnapped and the filmmakers imply that these would be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime barlow is eventually locked in dank room and wired up to shocking device his interrogator lost his family to the bombs and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child he does in chilling lasting images liked these scenes best because the political became personal it one thing to champion the plight of thousands it another to see ceiling cave in atop baby in crib russell has shocked us before his first film spanking the monkey is about young man affair with his bedridden mother it great his second flirting with disaster features character who has an armpit fetish one could argue that it easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions though russell disturbs us in three kings by being no nonsense about the violence when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home russell mutes the sound we re paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast three kings is russell first visually arresting picture stylistically it stands apart from other war dramas newton thomas sigel cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy which is of course entirely appropriate one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen friend enthusiastically added it like having sand in your eyes this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade three kings was shot in arizona california and mexico russell throws plenty at sigel camera for it to observe as was the case with russell previous efforts the most absurd moments are also the film most realistic even the most poignant we watch bullet puncture an organ from the inside if anything three kings settles down and stops surprising us its climax is pure hollywood no doubt the answer to why major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie minded russell subsequently the characters become more cartoonish barlow post torture revelry felt phony and chief strong presence in the first third fails to escape the god fearing ultra serious anti racist black man of power clich so much for cube avoiding token status the arab players on the other hand duck stereotype clooney too transforms into blandly heroic protestor marching with the rebels waited for him to shout let my people go hayseed vig notwithstanding the protagonists are very intelligent and self serving too had glimmer of hope based on russell filmography that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture it not spoiling much to write that then again what historical importance would such nastiness serve there already enough cynicism in the film mentioning of kuwait oil infested waters russell offers the masses primer on the oft dismissed gulf conflict and pulled off neat trick war tale full of battles that takes place after truce has been declared if he set out to make something socially culturally politically globally significant he succeeded with flair
the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ which explains why the bard materials are such popular source for remakes revisions rewrites inspiration subtlety credit and dispute indeed in recent years american contemporary cinema has been swamped with wash of shakespearean products including this year upcoming midsummer night dream shakespeare material has been the cause for twenty six big screen productions since 1990 but for change of pace mrs brown director john madden gives us story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare in love marc norman and tom stoppard story is largely fantasy although as the viewer soon learns shakespeare in love is not movie that takes itself seriously will shakespeare of the 1590 would ve been married to anne hathaway and he would ve had teenage daughter and two young sons here he is bachelor played by joseph fiennes will is writer struggling to come up with great play and his current comedy in the works romeo and ethel the pirate daughter just doesn quite seem right with the help of the great writer christopher marlowe rupert everett and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps gwyneth paltrow he changes things around and writes one of his greatest tragedies romeo and juliet the love story between will and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo and juliet to great effect fiennes and paltrow develop sexy chemistry as the two lovers which gives the movie much momentum this momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished and largely unsuccessful comedy the supporting roles are well filled out from geoffrey rush as will worrisome agent philip to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman even ben affleck leading the troupe of actors manages to make favorable impression and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth gwyneth paltrow is by far however the standout of the lot creating large percentage of the forementioned vibrance the story is well crafted if nothing else although it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the let make movie genre the dialogue is breezy and lighthearted and certainly accessible by the audience lowest common denominator there something for everyone in this romantic comedy making it prime date flick material although certainly not inspiring in any regard it revels in wholesome well rounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of 1998 pictures the true love story is one of the best around certainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent year open releases is just around the corner
robert altman cookie fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good it is sunny delightful dreamy comedy filled with lovely performances skillful direction and topped off with an understated clever extraordinary script as this is an ensemble piece it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters all of them residing in southern town called holly springs first we meet willie charles dutton an honest man with slight drinking habit we then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness despair and want of her dead husband we cut to camille glenn close who is obsessively directing play with her sister cora julianne moore then we briefly get acquainted with emma liv tyler an apparent relative of cookie who is down but not out teen outcast still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live we also fleetingly see emma lover jason chris donnell an ambitious but far too excitable young cop we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at picture of her husband she exclaims here come and then puts pillow to her face and shoots herself soon after her niece camille stops by to get fruit salad bowl comes upstairs finds cookie dead and flips out convinced that suicide is disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow yet sweet sister that it was murder she makes sure that she stages it like murder as well scattering jewelry all over the floor breaking few cabinets windows and doors and then throwing the gun out in the back yard the only reasonable suspect is willie who immediately gets taken into custody and put in jail cell they all know he didn do it so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma meanwhile the unperturbed camille continues her none too subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play success so begins cookie fortune film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as southern spin on fargo except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers darker somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade robert altman slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well in that both films focus on and off on the eccentricities of the residents in southern us town indeed most of the characters in cookie fortune are loads of fun to observe and portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi dimensional glenn close turns in an insubstantial in terms of her career but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie and she is perfectly cast as the prolific aunt alexandria character endlessly obsessed with family dignity the equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles dutton mimic time to kill there is nothing like movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours even days after the film ends cookie fortune is such movie loved the light kindhearted approach altman whose last project was the dark intense drama the gingerbread man took towards the tricky subject matter enjoyed the talented ensemble cast even liked the trite in the south everybody is related to everybody cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to close not sure why cookie fortune had such an all around pleasing effect on me perhaps it that good ol southern charm
the most amazing thing about paul cox innocence is how unlike movie it is mean that as the highest compliment if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle 40 year old romance want to run and hide the sex scenes would be handled as farce producers would shed 20 years off the characters ages so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence along with charming romantic story the australian belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable the romance gets started when former musician andreas charles bud tingwell learns that his true love claire julia blake lives nearby they decide to catch up on old times but soon find themselves in reinvigorating affair complicating matters is andreas frail health and claire longtime husband terry norris who can understand why he suddenly become obsolete in my mind the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire than the feelings of everyone involved john claire husband endlessly questions what he did wrong claire initially insists she grown up but admittedly behaves like child prospect that thrills and disappoints her andreas an agnostic begins to question his fate message cox delivers in memorable dream sequence cox litters the movie with flashbacks including the repeated vision of roaring train it reminder of andreas and claire past love as young lovers they met by train but as it recurs we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed pall is cast on the whole affair master of the understated cox strings together series of memorable moments in andreas dream sequence amidst the roar of the train and conversations we get the whole picture of andreas and claire love we also get glimpses into john and claire relationship during silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward claire admits to john about her indiscretion telling more than any monologue could all that heard is the scraping of forks against plates the characters are unlike anything ve seen they re people so many times movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky or they re reduced to comedic buffoons ordinary people with pile of emotions claire and andreas aren sure what the next step is they do want to be happy which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they ve known throughout their adult lives bravo to cox who wrote the script for not making john monster so that claire affair is automatically justified norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire love difficult to accept we feel for him he decent man sure he may have become complacent but he never expected this especially now with so much presented to the audience it only expected that the material gets little drawn out and repetitive which it does however in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers cox displays skill and lan isn likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon
swear have seen the edge before in fact it reminded me of the bear the river wild and other various films mixed into an entirely different film however the edge has done something that most action films should do and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot in doing so the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than say the peacemaker unfortunately because of those overused moments we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and few surprises to mess with your head one surprise in particular left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script action films are dime dozen in hollywood and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us they lack the one thing which would make them more respected genre intelligence even horror films have learned this genre which is probably the least respected of them all the river wild was one of the best action suspense films have seen from the 90s the intelligence of the screenplay and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day the edge has the intelligence and smart characters but this time the lack of originality is the downfall must admit that it was very suspenseful and had an original third half but the first hour and half is riddled with cliches and plot holes this is an example of the final act saving the film instead of the other way around as in the lost world if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes intensity it could have become great action film and use the term loosely the edge is pretty much survival of the fittest film but taking scream lead the edge makes fun of the genre cliches and then uses them though not quite as effectively charles morse anthony hopkins is the main character rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him for once we don immediately care for the main character instead we like bob alec baldwin photographer who is going to take pictures of charles wife mickey elle macpherson out in the wilderness they board plane and head to cabin somewhere in the arctic charles birthday is the same day and he receives altin watch from his wife and pocket knife from bob as action films go these items do have importance to the rest of the story but quite bit more than we first expect soon however bob wants to find native to shoot pictures of because of his personality charles bob bob assistant steve harold perrineau and the pilot head off to find him and as shown in the previews hit flock of birds flying south for the winter down the plane goes the pilot is killed and the three are left to survive in the wilderness director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film take for instance the entire man hunting bear plot this has been done many times in films with different animals and even bears but given the charles intelligence and bob uncertainty many of the cliches are given fresh twists even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before my favorite line of the film comes from charles most people die in the wilderness because they didn do the one thing that could save their life thinking despite the predictability of the main plot subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise and made me smile when realized that everything isn as it seems anymore have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise so instead will avoid it entirely the first two thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along and some of charles survival techniques seem possible even making fire from ice tamahori is able to create lot of suspense from the stalking bear but whenever the bear is present the characters lose all sensibility have always wondered why characters in films walk over log to get across water why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across guess getting chased by bear makes your thought process turn off for while thankfully we already have begun to care for the characters and so we let this small detail slide but some of the technical details are awkward such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make where did they get thread and needles the acting of the film is highly above average for film of this nature and borders on phenomenal anthony hopkins gives terrific performance creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences sympathy something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs alec baldwin gives one of his best performances have ever seen it sure is better from his fair game baldwin can be good or bad character and here he succeeds at both in way you can never quite guess if he is nice or vllainous character until the end and baldwin is able to handle the double natured photographer elle macpherson gives good performance albeit slight she isn in the film all that much but for the scenes she does have she handles as an actress not as model harold perrineau is good actor and his scenes are nice and underplayed he is eliminated early and reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable the edge is rated for graphic violence some gore and language some of the violence is little too disturbing even for me this film is nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to but too many cliches bog it down director tamahori has created very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts david mamet script though has lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat and the acting is solid the best thing about the script is the ending which doesn end with the normal high strung action sequence but with small detail involving certain gift it nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear and by the way most people laughed when the film faded to siyah due to large credit to bart the bear way to go bart

director dominic sena who made the highly underrated kalifornia and producer jerry bruckheimer the rock armageddon bring us slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen nicolas cage plays memphis retired car thief who pulled back in to the business by an evil car thief overlord christopher eccleston determined to kill memphis kid brother giovanni ribisi memphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang memphis sets out to put his old crew back together but discovers that most of them have retired as well gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits in that sequence we get rockin little tune from moby along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects filmmakers can sometimes make or break film just from its opening title sequence and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride and what follows doesn disappoint cage turns in one of his good performances here he can easily go either way good or bad don know how he does that and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely of the supporting cast members angelina jolie as memphis former love is in the film just to provide eye candy she definitely the hottest looking grease monkey ve ever seen and robert duvall as memphis former mentor is just around to lend the film some class also big fan of will patton armageddon the postman and would love to see him get huge role someday none of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately some underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles delroy lindo get shorty shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis as does timothy olyphant go as lindo partner just wish some of the other characters could have been as important the only real gripe have about the film though is its conclusion mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll there no doubt in anyone mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen and the filmmakers blew perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the rival car thief plot line as it stands that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in tidy little package but if was making this film have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew thereby making memphis have to improvise thereby adding some meat to the plot the finale is essentially just big car chase and there just aren ways to make car chases interesting anymore it all been done the chase is also shot and edited in that jerry bruckheimer action sequence kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene sure it car chase but what exactly are the particulars of it it very hard to tell finally there stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the bus jumping the ramp sequence from speed in the oh don think so department despite those minor complaints gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment it not thought provoking but it shiny loud and fun just what summer flick should be [pg 13]
capsule the best place to start if you re jackie chan newcomer roars along never stops for breath and frequently hilarious to talk about jackie chan as stuntman is to miss million things jackie is not only one of the most accomplished and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today but also very funny guy he reminds me of the way arnold schwartzenegger used to make me laugh he funny just standing there copping look supercop has jackie making us laugh scream duck root and gasp for breath often all in the same scene it actually the third in loosely related series of movies each with jackie playing kevin chan hong kong policeman who has knack for getting neck deep into trouble and then karate kicking his way out of it the others are also worth seeing it little slow to start but once it gets moving it field day the movie has fairly sophisticated plot for movies of this kind kevin is tapped for dangerous dea assignment to be accomplished in mainland china which requires him to collaborate with the attractive and ass kicking chief fo chinese security played here by the ever enjoyable michelle yeoh there fun chemistry between the two of them especially in an early scene where she tries to brief him and he keeps making wondering comments about how great she looks in that uniform kevin is assigned to help spring known gangster from jail all undercover of course and have him lead the two of them to noted drug boss the drug boss however has problems of his own his wife on trial for many of his own crimes and she got the key to an account with all of his drug funds this means of course endless trouble not the least of which is that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while he out in the field and she sees him with this other woman and but that one of the movie unique pleasures the way it crosses from action to comedy effortlessly action there is of course non stop action in this movie everything from one on one kung fu to all out gun battles to sppedboat with eight engines outrunning the hong kong coast guard there is also virtuoso climax which features among other things jackie danging from ladder tied to helicopter wrong way freeway chase which requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult handstand stunt fight on top of moving train that also involves the copter as well as motorcycle you get the idea this is to action movies what burger with everything on it is to fast food quick enjoyable filling watch it with friends when they stop making movies like this the world will be tad greyer
the calendar year has not even reached its midway point but that hasn prevented columbia pictures from trotting out lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar bait season bille august high profile adaptation of victor hugo classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from classy hollywood epic handsome production values strong performances by top notch cast literate screenplay with one critically missing element emotional sweep for those not familiar with hugo original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like 19th century french set version of the fugitive after serving 19 years in prison work camp for stealing loaf of bread the brutish jean valjean liam neeson is paroled immediately upon release he steals valuable silverware from kindly bishop who takes him in for night he is caught by authorities only to be forgiven by the bishop who lets valjean keep the silver to start new life on the straight and narrow that he does and in doing so breaks his parole which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert geoffrey rush who was one of the guards in valjean prison camp on his trail thematically however les miserables is story about redemption which valjean finds through his dealings with two women the hard luck factory worker turned prostitute fantine uma thurman and her illegitimate daughter cosette years after breaking parole valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau where he forms warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert valjean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette mimi newman from her cruel caretakers the thenardiers and raise the child as his own the father and daughter eventually land in paris where the teenage cosette claire danes falls for dashing student revolutionary marius hans matheson the decades spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of and the danish august turns in his most accomplished english language work following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last year stylish but highly preposterous mystery smilla sense of snow he and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at brisk pace production designer anna asp costume designer gabriella pescucci and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast neeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable rush finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated oscar winning theatrics in shine and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role the younger members of the cast fare less well danes is convincing as cosette but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes distraction and matheson while competent is less interesting robert sean leonard as technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is by the time les miserables was over my emotions had only been superficially involved while was touched by valjean relationships with fantine and cosette was not moved not even reaching the touching level is the cosette marius pairing my only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical as am sure many others is and was dismayed to see eponine friend of marius who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation the daughter of the thenardiers here she is only briefly seen as child her presence would have added some much needed conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance but suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine fantine was enough even so as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season les miserables is thoughtful well made entertaining film one that will sate moviegoers hungry for dose of drama before popcorn no brainers invade the multiplex

can hear the question already what on earth do these two movies have in common to most people not lot except that both are by renowned directors as saw them however both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers but oh how differently the packages affect their films while everyone production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special jane campion imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones script is left everyone says love you not remembering lot about who loved whom but its infectious happiness put grin on my face left the portrait of lady not remembering lot about who loved whom and could have cared less everyone features nothing allen hasn done before storywise woody is again desperately in love with beautiful woman roberts and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong again similar situations happen to his family and friends some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his early funny films the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of take the money and run his directorial debut however nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one of kind display of sheer good spirits in fact in this movie the feeling itself is what most important yes the movie would have been better among his very best think if it had meatier story but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling and what better way to express feeling than through music love is often best expressed in song and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart some are tad too goofy such as the number where lot of ghosts prance around in funeral parlor but admired allen for even putting them in there it also helps that as usual allen has top flight cast working with him their singing voices range from quite good goldie hawn to not quite good allen to literally unlistenable barrymore whose real voice was dubbed by professional but while their vocal abilities differ all the actors do great job of putting joy up there on the screen and making it rub off on the audience granted some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies but for those attuned to it this film should work wonders jane campion too has top flight cast working for her in portrait of lady too but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being stilted virtually lifeless mess albeit visually interesting one campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with great variety of eye filling images that linger in the mind unfortunately what didn linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting remember very well shots of train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman but can remember very little of what happened between all these people even worse don find myself feeling bad that ve forgotten the problem think lies not with the cast which seemed to be trying very hard for the material it was the script that couldn convince me to care about anyone the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion but found no reason to connect with any of them understood that the story was about cold emotionally vacant characters but for me to care about them have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives jones script never simply gave me that opportunity in the end it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes unfortunately as she kept painting these dazzling pictures they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film in the end the movie one strength ended up hurting it so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots and yet was able to truly enjoy one of them why with both films my head cared about neither story but only everyone says love you was able to make my heart sing
note there are spoilers regarding the film climax the election of course we see matthew broderick man torn to primal state he been unfaithful to his wife lied to and manipulated his students and by the same token they ve demeaned his masculinity his self respect his desperate attempt at changing the world and yet he equates the cause of his pain his torment with tracy flick reese witherspoon no matter how many students have come and gone and disappointed him as an educator she the real threat about to give in and divulge that she won by only lone vote broderick mccalister turns in defeat sees tracy euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says no the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men no matter how obscure have in their relationships traditional expectation of success to usurp and surpass women as proverbial industry she can go higher than him he won allow it and what amazing about election is that every word of that criticism is drawn from rather opaque metaphor early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically and then sexually involved with now departed teacher it like payne and taylor his co screenwriter have taken tracy girl desperate for friendship loyalty and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers that they found sitting at the teachers lunch table more fitting to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist and it amazing the compassion that we have it seems so real to us and not merely because it happened before splashed all over the front pages but because of the all around nice persona of these people we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters it with mandy barnett if you ll be the teacher playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most final viscous injection of bittersweet irony sexuality though is not the only basis for payne satire or its success it also makes telling point about politics friendship and class boundaries satire is required or ought to be anyway to take itself seriously or act so while the audience does not it fine line to straddle but some films ignore it altogether drop dead gorgeous leaps infuriatingly to mind payne and taylor hit the right chord their characters are real people neither is perfect but rather both of the leads are flawed misguided individuals who retain somewhat noble intentions at heart we sympathize with them but still as satire their idiosyncratic behavior and their wrongdoing is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle but also reflect and meditate about minus half point though for payne admitting not to having seen ferris bueller day off whatever
