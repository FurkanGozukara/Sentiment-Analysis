the happy bastard quick movie review damn that y2k bug it got head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother william this time in story regarding crew of tugboat that comes across deserted russian tech ship that has strangeness to it when they kick the power back on little do they know the power within going for the gore and bringing on few action sequences here and there virus still feels very empty like movie going for all flash and no substance we don know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere we don know the origin of what took over the ship just that big pink flashy thing hit the mir and of course we don know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout here it just hey let chase these people around with some robots the acting is below average even from the likes of curtis you re more likely to get kick out of her work in halloween h20 sutherland is wasted and baldwin well he acting like baldwin of course the real star here are stan winston robot design some schnazzy cgi and the occasional good gore shot like picking into someone brain so if robots and body parts really turn you on here your movie otherwise it pretty much sunken ship of movie
it is movies like these that make jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch based on the late 1960 television show by the same name the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover however things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion of course the ads make it seem like so much more quick cuts cool music claire dane nice hair and cute outfits car chases stuff blowing up and the like sounds like cool movie does it not after the first fifteen minutes it quickly becomes apparent that it is not the mod squad is certainly slick looking production complete with nice hair and costumes but that simply isn enough the film is best described as cross between an hour long cop show and music video both stretched out into the span of an hour and half and with it comes every single clich it doesn really matter that the film is based on television show as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we ve already seen the characters and acting is nothing spectacular sometimes even bordering on wooden claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored which really transfers onto the audience the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi who plays the resident crazy man ultimately being the only thing worth watching unfortunately even he not enough to save this convoluted mess as all the characters don do much apart from occupying screen time with the young cast cool clothes nice hair and hip soundtrack it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset despite an american rating which the content does not justify the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset information on the characters is literally spoon fed to the audience would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us dialogue is poorly written and the plot is extremely predictable the way the film progresses you likely won even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy because you ll know they aren basing the show on 1960 television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand even one that missing finger or two the number of times that checked my watch six is clear indication that this film is not one of them it is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar judging from the rash of really awful teen flicks that we ve been seeing as of late avoid this film at all costs
quest for camelot is warner bros first feature length fully animated attempt to steal clout from disney cartoon empire but the mouse has no reason to be worried the only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall promising if flawed 20th century fox production anastasia but disney hercules with its lively cast and colorful palate had her beat hands down when it came time to crown 1997 best piece of animation this year it no contest as quest for camelot is pretty much dead on arrival even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre that be pocahontas for those of you keeping score isn nearly as dull as this the story revolves around the adventures of free spirited kayley voiced by jessalyn gilsig the early teen daughter of belated knight from king arthur round table kayley only dream is to follow in her father footsteps and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber gary oldman an ex round table member gone bad steals arthur magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in dangerous booby trapped forest with the help of hunky blind timberland dweller garrett carey elwes and two headed dragon eric idle and don rickles that always arguing with itself kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as fighter on arthur side quest for camelot is missing pure showmanship an essential element if it ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney there nothing here that differentiates quest from something you see on any given saturday morning cartoon subpar animation instantly forgettable songs poorly integrated computerized footage compare kayley and garrett run in with the angry ogre to herc battle with the hydra rest my case even the characters stink none of them are remotely interesting so much that the film becomes race to see which one can out bland the others in the end it tie they all win that dragon comedy shtick is awfully cloying but at least it shows signs of pulse at least fans of the early 90s tgif television line up will be thrilled to find jaleel urkel beyaz and bronson balki pinchot sharing the same footage few scenes are nicely realized though at loss to recall enough to be specific and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic though most are paired up with singers who don sound thing like them for their big musical moments jane seymour and celine dion but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults quest for camelot most grievous error is its complete lack of personality and personality we learn from this mess goes very long way
synopsis mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves boy from potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy mother fledgling restauranteur unsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman favor he takes pictures of her and kills number of people in his way comments stalked is yet another in seemingly endless string of spurned psychos getting their revenge type movies which are stable category in the 1990s film industry both theatrical and direct to video their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they re typically inexpensive to produce no special effects no big name stars and serve as vehicles to flash nudity allowing them to frequent late night cable television stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect the psycho never actually has an affair on the contrary he rejected rather quickly the psycho typically is an ex lover ex wife or ex husband other than that stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable stalked does not provide much suspense though that is what it sets out to do interspersed throughout the opening credits for instance serious sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause man to stalk it implicitly implied that all stalkers are men while pictures of boy are shown on the screen after these credits snapshot of actor jay underwood appears the narrator states that this is the story of daryl gleason and tells the audience that he is the stalker of course really this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels if the movie was meant to be about daryl then it should have been called stalker not stalked okay so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts no guesswork required stalked proceeds then as it begins obvious obvious obvious the opening sequence contrived quite bit brings daryl and brooke the victim together daryl obsesses over brooke follows her around and tries to woo her ultimately rejected by her his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate these plans include the all time psycho in love cliche the murdered pet for some reason this genre films require dead pet to be found by the victim stalked stalked is no exception it cat this time found in the shower events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked where only one survives guess who it invariably always is and you ll guess the conclusion to this turkey stalked cast is uniformly adequate not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either jay underwood as the stalker turns toward melodrama bit too much he overdoes it in other words but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands maryam abo about the only actor close to being star here she played the bond chick in the living daylights is equally adequate as the stalked of the title even though she seems too ditzy at times to be strong independent business owner brooke abo needs to be ditzy however for the plot to proceed toward the end for example brooke has her suspicions about daryl to ensure he won use it as another excuse to see her brooke decides to return toolbox he had left at her place to his house does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers of course not she tries the door opens it and wanders around the house when daryl returns he enters the house of course so our heroine is in danger somehow even though her car is parked at the front of the house right by the front door daryl is oblivious to her presence inside the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character intelligence stalked receives two stars because even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring it is not so bad that it cannot be watched rated mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in strip bar it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are if you re in the mood for good suspense film though stake out something else
capsule in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace there is lot of fighting and not whole lot of story otherwise john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films especially assault on precinct 13 that the new film comes off as his homage to himself to +4 john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes for writer and director of horror films supposedly an expert on horror it is very bad mistake to make ghosts of mars is called horror movie but it is more just drawn out fight between humans and surprisingly low powered alien menace in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars carpenter would have grounds to sue this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 the thing and prince of darkness it is in fact surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way but that still does not make for really good science fiction experience ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear which is good for the film budget it is never mentioned but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth normal again making it easier to film society has changed bit by that time but it has advanced surprisingly little apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control and from carpenter view women have really made mess of things society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct yes precinct has been replaced by somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony instead of having the criminal napolean wilson this film has the criminal desolation williams instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face well ghosts of mars because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner but they essentially behave as human savages in another lapse of imagination the story is told in flashback flashback within flashback and flashback within flashback within flashback ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of kirmizi yellow and siyah carpenter manages to give us powerful opening scene showing mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with heavy beat sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup the terror he creates looks little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss his idea of building suspense is having bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights within short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars kirmizi planet and ghosts of mars after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by rate ghosts of mars on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale following the movie showed my wife who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than did carpenter classic assault on precinct 13 her comment is that it was seeing the same film twice
so ask yourself what 8mm eight millimeter is really all about is it about wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography is it about the business itself how bubbling just beneath the surface of big town americana there sordid world of sick and depraved people who won necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires or is it about those who can those who are in position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see not talking about snuff films supposed documentaries of victims being brutalized and killed on camera talking about films like 8mm and its director joel schumacher with recent run of big budget movies to his credit batman robin time to kill batman forever the client schumacher certainly has that kind of influence is 8mm something you really want to see probably not the first two thirds of 8mm unwind as fairly conventional missing persons drama albeit with particularly unsavory core then as it been threatening all along the film explodes into violence and just when you think it finally over schumacher tags on ridiculous self righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further trust me there are better ways to waste two hours of your life nicolas snake eyes cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether reel of film found in her late husband safe documents young girl murder welles goes about his assignment rather matter of factly and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly almost as if you don need any specialized skills or training to do this welles certainly makes it look easy and cops obviously never look in toilet tanks for clues the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes like george scott in paul schrader hardcore occasionally little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through film projector reminding him of his unpleasant task there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife played by catherine keener who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split level home in harrisburg pa 8mm doesn condemn or condone its subject matter it just exploits it the irony of course is that schumacher and seven scribe andrew kevin walker vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an rated first run hollywood product so we only see snippets of snuff and lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror later it the turn of joaquin phoenix who quite good and by far the film most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again all this to get to the familiar yet offensive revelation that sexual deviants are not indeed monsters but everyday people like you and me neither super nor standard 8mm is shocking only in its banality
that exactly how long the movie felt to me there weren even nine laughs in nine months it terrible mess of movie starring terrible mess of man mr hugh grant huge dork it not the whole oral sex prostitution thing referring to grant not me that bugs me it the fact that grant is annoying not just adam sandler annoying we re talking jim carrey annoying since when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting but on the other hand since when do really bad slapstick fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant head in joan cusack lap scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie and obscene double entendres robin williams the obstetrician tells grant pregnant girlfriend she has big pussy referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat but nonetheless grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie pass for comedy nine months is predictable cookie cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot hugh grant plays successful child psychiatrist why child psychologist so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange kid my dad an asshole grant flutters eyelashes offers nervous smile then responds in his annoying english accent and think actually have talent attitude could you possibly elaborate on that kid my dad _huge_ asshole more like hugh asshole but that beside the point which is nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief so anyway grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction fluttered eyelashes nervous smiles this paves the way for every possible pregnancy child birth gag in the book especially since grant equally annoying friend wife is also pregnant the annoying friend is played by tom arnold who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick none of which is funny such as scene where arnold beats up costumed arnie the dinosaur you draw your own parallels on that one in toy store the only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway as an artist with fear of and simultaneous longing for commitment not even robin williams who plays russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics has much humor his is one joke character the old foreign guy who mispronounces english stereotype did someone say yakov smirnov that my favorite vodka by the way hence the line now it time to take look at your volvo another nasty but unamusing joke except this one goes right over the ten year olds heads while the adults simultaneously groan nine months is complete failure low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud unfunny slapstick failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy hugh grant sunset boulevard arrest please no caught with his pants down jokes may bring more people into the theaters but they certainly won leave with smile on their faces not after 90 minutes of grant nervous smiles everything in the movie is so forced so unauthentic that anyone with an over 80 sorry hugh will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire but at least they didn spend 60 bucks for it
call it road trip for the walking wounded stellan skarsg rd plays such convincingly zombified drunken loser that it difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly boozed out presence yet this ever reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen sentimental and painfully mundane european drama playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late that an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father tomas skarsg rd and his alienated openly hostile yuppie daughter kaisa lena headey gossip they haven spoken in years and wouldn even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen scotland by automobile if it weren for kaisa mother charlotte rampling under the sand rotting away in hospital bed from cancer in soap opera twist mother has only few days to live only in the movies right too blitzed to even step foot on plane tomas hits the open road with kaisa loathing each other all the while they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out whenever he isn muttering what rotten kid she turned out to be despite his sloshed viewpoint tomas recognizes that the apple hasn fallen very far from the tree kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke sabotages her personal relationships through indifference and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper ain they pair unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one note and repetitively bitchy dialogue screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate series of contrivances to propel events forward lost money roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around nosy cops and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative by the time they reach the hospital it time to unveil the secrets from dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father daughter conflict they re also the mainstays of many bad strindberg wannabe this revelation exists purely for its own sake aberdeen doesn know where else to go weak unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa if lena headey were stronger actress perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody haunting cinematography rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world the reference to certain superior american indie flick intentional headey too busy acting using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance if she were paying any attention to skarsg rd maybe she figure out that doing less can reveal so much more it worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 jonathan nossiter captivating signs wonders it not just because skarsg rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films they re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant in aberdeen rampling is luminous diva preening and static in her hospital bed despite skarsg rd solid performance as tomas his pathetic drunk is never given much of chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow there genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs wonders allowing them to suggest gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity nossiter film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain if signs wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas at least it willing to stretch beyond what we ve come to expect from traditional drama aberdeen is never half so ambitious content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan trite but occasionally useful grand canyon where steve martin hollywood mogul pronounces all of life riddles are answered in the movies even foreign films are taking that advice to heart
best remembered for his understated performance as dr hannibal lecter in michael mann forensics thriller manhunter scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on usually playing bit role in some studio schlock he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight he only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do if you want to see some brilliant acting check out his work as dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach hidden agenda cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge big john feels the love that dares not speak its name but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light he an even tempered funny robust old man who actually listens to the kids problems as opposed to their parents and friends both caught up in the high wire act of their own confused lives he ll have sex for pay with them only after an elaborate courtship charming them with temptations from the grown up world stands for long island expressway which slices through the strip malls and middle class homes of suburbia filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as pretty transparent metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15 year old protagonist howie paul franklin dano in his opening voice over howie reveals morbid preoccupation with death on the road citing the highway deaths of filmmaker alan pakula songwriter harry chapin and his own mother on exit 52 he both fascinated and disturbed by the and those feelings are projected onto big john who follows howie around in his bright kirmizi car but never makes move to force the boy to do something he doesn want to do this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies he beast but ashamed of it would have worked best as half hour short film about howie ill advised foray into big john haven there is unnecessary padding with howie miserable dad bruce altman in the hot seat for white collar crime degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle class houses and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise ass gary terrio billy kay handsome artful dodger rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui not that we needed another movie on that subject these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length concurrently the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted cox sporting baseball cap and faded marine tattoo is all bluff and bluster dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent we re so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious calling haley joel it surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene the restraint is admirable but screenplay doesn always give them the best material when howie reads big john walt whitman poem the moment feels bit too precious director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach goldberg variations it too much there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john other boy toy walter masterson jealous over the newbie this plot thread predictably leads to violence not content to be haunting observational portrait of teen alienation in royally screwed up world like terry zwigoff superb ghost world cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note it typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with bullet sparing the writers from actually having to come up with complex philosophical note in this regard and countless other indie films share something in common with blockbuster action films problems are solved when the obstacle is removed how often does real life work this way to extend the question if movie is striving for realism do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion
janeane garofalo in romantic comedy it was good idea couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker this is by the books movie that plods along on predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs it also jumps on the ever popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there too garofalo plays campaign aide to massacusetts senator jay sanders running for reelection denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that made the kennedy family so popular so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit she soon learns why easier said than done is the mantra of movies like this the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong garofalo has to take tiny plane to ireland almost misses the bus to town can get hotel room ends up in the smallest trashiest one around has dog piss on her luggage and so on then comes what roger ebert calls the meet cute it happens in every romance the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional cinematic way in the matchmaker it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds nude sean david hara in the bathtub his dog sitting at his side no points for guessing it the same dog that just made water on her luggage also no points for guessing garofalo hates hara on sight that how it works in movies like these know from the instant saw that irishman in the bathtub that she hate him for awhile then succumb to his charms live happily for reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil after which they reconcile in time for happy irish tune to play over the end credits haven mentioned the movie twist yet garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into future of bliss milo shea who looks like an irish tom snyder is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together rest assured he ll do all he can to match up garofalo and hara oh and in keeping with the matchmaker utter predictability he dies toward the end what the message here sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction like garofalo will sell out with weak script was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie but they actually only have two or three scenes together leary stays stateside for the most part yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole he even undoes himself with the old microphone still on after he done giving the speech cliche both of them should have known better
movie like mortal kombat annihilation works and must be reviewed on multiple levels first there the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie but occasionaly almost as if making an ironic self depreciating remark the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery no no just kidding had you going there for moment didn in all seriousness however and to be fair to the movie it is necessary to provide two viewpoints that of movie watcher unfamiliar or only marginally familiar with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon and that of fan of the first movie and or fan of the games the first movie mortal kombat 1995 concerned itself with martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth and it billion inhabitants the mortals won and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth unfortunately shao khan was poor loser and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway ready to take over the planet as our heroes assumed fighting stance the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those like myself who are fans of the game even go so far as to say that many folks who didn know about the game probably enjoyed the movie the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself and they didn try to overachieve there were lot of really cool fight scenes with really cool accompanying music intersperesed with some distracting but ultimately non intrusive bits of fluff passing itself off as plot and as we know the movie was smashing success at the box office mortal kombat annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie shao khan has decided that he going to take over the earth anyways and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused being trite being silly and being just plain stupid one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought hey that last movie was such success that we can get more money and make real movie now too bad they didn simply stick with the formula from the first movie could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture but here are the high points the acting is truly bad sandra hess playing the sonya blade character is particularly execrable especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie in one of the worst pieces of mis casting think ve ever seen james remar plays raiden the god of thunder in the first movie christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke french actor playing japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics generally like it when actors are cast against type tim tiny lister jr being cast as the president of the in the fifth element for example and remar has always been one of my favorite utility actors but he so totally wrong for this part that he doesn even have the luxury of amused self awareness there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important but then never seen again there are number of completely meaningless story sidetracks including muddled scene where liu kang robin shou seeks out nightwolf litefoot has mystical hallucination and then wanders off with jade irina pantaeva for these reasons and many others can only give the movie unless you re huge fan of the games and or the first movie in that case the following critiques also apply sandra hess while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson who played sonya blade in the first movie is much more convincing as fighter wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts and puts together much more believable fight scene in the fights each of the characters does at least one thing they do in the game and often more sonya does her kiss of death jax does his earthquake liu kang does his animality and so on big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely there aren as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang more robust plot in between silly silly folks and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into mud wrestling match lame and so obviously sexist even politically incorrect for the most part noticed and remarked upon it the special effects are generally better except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their animalities motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games give this you ll probably like it but not nearly as much as you liked the first one
she was the femme in la femme nikita he was the baldwin in backdraft sliver and fair game with cindy crawford together anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make shattered image the biggest piece of hooey since the stallone stone thriller the specialist the film poses the question what if the life you re living now is really dream and your dreams reality it either about woman who haunted by recurring and recurring and recurring nightmare that she hired assassin or it about hired assassin who haunted by recurring and recurring and recurring nightmare that she honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica it doesn much matter and believe me by the time shattered image runs its painful and pedestrian course you won care these two lives with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with siyah wig siyah emotionless eyes and siyah leather clothing in the seattle based assassin scenes and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is it now twice as boring as it might have been it not that complicated plots can be entertaining of course it helps if you have interesting characters crisp dialogue and modicum of style shattered image isn complex it just stupid and boring parillaud and baldwin who aren exactly shakespearean material to begin with are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines lines like you don beg you insist like that in woman that parillaud character talking to her cat and you re not the reason couldn care less about you huh and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film if you give me couple of minutes you know ll charm the pants off you don have that kind of time talking of pants parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say point of no return we have come to expect this from billy baldwin but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first but there nothing to learn karen is as interesting as cereal box someone out to get me crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone the stranger who sends her flowers maybe even her husband himself is her would be killer siouxsie is the chromium cool tough as nails crack killing machine who shoots out couple of mirrors in order to justify the film meaningless stock title baldwin seems more interested in parillaud nest egg so that he can pave paradise and put up parking lot than he does in her each time graham greene shows up he gets killed barbet schroeder reversal of fortune co produced and should be ashamed of himself every now and again it fun to watch really bad movie and every now and again as shattered image makes agonizingly clear it isn
john carpenter makes movies always has halloween escape from new york the thing and by the looks of it they live escape from vampires always will carpenter latest horror opus with science fiction bent or science fiction outing with schlock horror bent is the aptly titled john carpenter ghosts of mars in case suppose you went looking for someone else ghosts of mars like all those films prefixed by the very possessive john carpenter ghosts of mars is an unashamed movie punctuated by movie plot movie actors and movie special effects in category one above we have storyline that borders on idiotic and at times chaotic dormant martians swirling kirmizi gases awakened by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes all this explained in flashback to some grand pooh bah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard natasha henstridge from the sub species films the only returnee on silly looking train officer ballard went in to bring back incarcerated felon james desolation williams what she found was not pretty picture in the second category we have ms henstridge her blonde hair pulled back tightly and awkwardly into ponytail ice cube as the appropriately named desolation pam grier briefly oddly who wanted to work with whom wonder and host of extras all assuming that the story and special effects were going to carry this film and therefore they didn need to try too hard in category number three we have in addition to those swirling kirmizi gases and the silly looking train couple of bird eye view shots of sprawling martian metropolis reddish also state of the art special effects have never been carpenter trademark and once again the writer director who seems to have no problem finding work however doesn waste any of the film budget in that department ghosts of mars is lock laughing stock and barrel all your standard carpenter fare dingy interiors cluttered exteriors inane dialogue lots of leather scarred crazed looking aliens and lots and lots of weaponry the film often and always explodes into warfare without warning spontaneously stupidly carpenter might like to think he made western here but it western without any real heroes villains or border conflicts it just the shootouts minus hissing snake plissken never thought miss the guy but do it not all the same however dubbed the one note wonder for his minimalist music soundtracks carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic yet effective scoring by highlighting his action with loud screeching guitar work fortunately this drowns out lot of the dialogue the final exchange between henstridge and er cube though is both audible and priceless mars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so what with the stillborn mission to mars and kirmizi planet with val kilmer ghosts of mars sadly adds to those disappointing returns in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by bunch of sequels among them american pie and rush hour the irony is that the mars in carpenter film feels sadly absent there are occasional references to the kirmizi planet of course but the film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earth closest neighbor two things keep john carpenter ghosts of mars from getting huge slap upside the head henstridge keeps her top on miraculously and the film doesn pretend to be anything it not what that means however is that fans of superior intelligent grade sci fi horror are singularly out of luck
really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone sure she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god green earth second only to that movie critic at large guy but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in she always strikes out the crush was slow moving predictable piece of fluff hideaway was horrific novel adaptation alicia had only minor role in clueless was an annoying unfunny waste of time and people have mailed me too saying clueless is good movie and that the only one who doesn like it one girl said if seen the movie with an open mind would have enjoyed it nothing could be further from the truth went into the theater expecting to love the movie the preview looked good and of course crazymadinlove with alicia but the movie was bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny unlikable characters almost everyone saw the movie with felt the same way when we were walking out of the theater one guy and it wasn me yelled out that was the worst f$&#in movie ve ever seen and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement so last night walked into the video store and saw alicia pretty face on the cover of some made for video thriller called the babysitter knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway what got was 90 minutes of regret the worst alicia silverstone movie ever and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like where to begin in criticizing this movie the plot is thin shred that moves slower than glacier the writing could have been done and for all we know it was by ten year old alicia is the star and she still wasted in movie that has no appeal whatsoever there is zero humor zero suspense zero drama and zero action until the last ten minutes when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with violent sequence zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero so why does this movie get one star out of me well alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub and if it wasn bubble bath the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four star features but you settle for what you can get alicia plays babysitter who spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at cocktail party and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home at least that movie critic at large guy does as the movie trods along we discover she not only the mostly silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character fantasies and probably every male viewer too the drunken father thinks she just the thing to recapture his lost youth her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she taking her bubble bath they even throw in the middle aged wife fantasies about male counterpart at the party not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in siyah silk teddy at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg rated in fact could imagine the babysitter becoming cinemax late night staple if not for the fact that there absolutely no nudity in it so you can call it sex flick ve already pointed out that it can fall under drama comedy thriller or action so what do you classify the babysitter as bad
so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci fi films such as close encounters of the third kind 2001 space odyssey apollo 13 and contact well whatever it is you sure as hell hope that it would be thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such melange considering the disastrous results we re left with here this is film that takes little bit of everything but ultimately adds up to lot of nothing it like said this movie sucks plot rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 after an unknown energy force leads to loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the kirmizi planet critique extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie uneven would be another the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise the buzz around it had been so so and even the film itself starts off with decent first twenty minutes all leading you to believe that it actually going to go somewhere but it isn long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry colored planet tries too hard to get us into the pain of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix in sci fi movie well don know much of it just seemed like bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and half only to figure out some big secret in the end secret which practically had me yawning with excitement ultimately this is movie that starts off with decent premise joins the crew in their misadventures in space for the main crux of its journey and eventually settles down for one of the most anti climactic endings this side of contact mind you if you enjoyed that film shrug of the shoulders ending you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well of course don remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story ugh what friggin mess films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again didn anybody recognize the crappiness in this script didn they read the bad dialogue the cheezy lines the obvious derivative nature of the work mind you with director like depalma at the helm that ain saying much of course you can really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry connell in this fine crew of thespians nuff said neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film musical score during the last fifteen minutes presumably in order to wake the audience up okay we get it brian this scene is supposed to be powerful wow yawn my ears hurt so is anything salvageable in this movie sure gary sinise does another great job as does cheadle the film doesn completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening and yes the sand twister effect that you see in the commercial is well done other than that guess could say that admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies oops did say admire meant am disgusted all in all this movie delivers very little in actual substance offers two bit dialogue masked in lot of sci fi mumbo jumbo pretends to be deep when really it just sappy and eventually just settles into an ending which other than presenting us with pathetic computer graphic as part of the story gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck go see the ninth gate now there great movie and on personal note think it time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12 minute uninterrupted film sequences and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting
the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film end if you re not familiar with this law then maybe you ve seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film end now if you re regular reader of mine you ve heard me say this countless times you know how drive me crazy is going to end but is the journey to get to that ending worth it no it definitely is not melissa joan hart from abc sabrina the teenage witch likes hunky stud on the basketball team adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who just broken up with his activist girlfriend apparently he wants to make his ex girlfriend jealous enough to take him back and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance so the two pretend to date for some reason but only after hart gives grenier bath to turn him into hunky stud will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends will this crazy scheme work do care the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy what makes movies like can hardly wait and 10 things hate about you work and to lesser extent she all that and never been kissed is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is joke and write their scripts accordingly don know what the writer intention was with drive me crazy there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to here there nothing just teens whining about who going to take them to the big dance do me favor kids go get job or something just shut the hell up in all honesty the best part of this film is the end credits now normally when say that it followed with the joke because the movie is finally over in this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film after the obligatory second playing of britney spears titular song there quick commercial jingle for burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and brief rendition of the school song for their high school nothing great but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them sci fi fans take note there are brief appearances from stephen collins star trek the motion picture and faye grant the tv miniseries and the final battle [pg 13]
mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see great big gorilla his entrance however is grand one out from the trees he leaps gargantuan and imposing sporting hands big enough to crush volkswagen bug and pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have joe bellows at the poachers before him angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars during this scene turned to my friend and said wow that some ape joe is quite gorilla big digital gorilla he runs around the fields chasing cars and people he picks things up and stares at them pensively he breaks things on accident because he just too big to avoid clumsiness joe as special effect is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes as character he doesn quite register and the story he been put in is as limp as they come the words family entertainment have never been stamp of quality but might joe young is just silly special effects movie pretending to have heart the picture is remake of the 1949 film it mostly just about the big gorilla but strictly as formality the movie also has few human characters the main one is jill young poor charlize theron forced to waste her talent lover of gorillas as child she witnessed group of poachers murder her mother now she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife specifically she out to protect joe giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood soon zoologist gregg hara bill paxton discovers joe he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to big game hunter named strasser rade sherbedgia who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill mother so in an effort to save joe jill and gregg take the big gorilla to preserve where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers in addition the space is way too small for him after all he is really big gorilla and to add to the complications strasser shows up under benevolent pretext he tells jill that he has preserve big enough for joe and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill mother jill of course doesn recognize strasser even though he did kill her mother this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with special effects film the movie isn really offensive it has some competent actors few nifty sets and lot of scenes with big digitized gorilla but the story is really dumb there aren any characters and the film isn satisfying on any level beyond its visuals the movie also has bad dialogue if critic says that film has bad dialogue it only fair to quote some of it but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like joe isn happy and joe isn safe here we need to get joe out of here joe is way too big for that cage don know if these phrases are word for word but they re close as said the characters here are only present as formality they do little more than state the obvious of course joe is too big for that cage paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on script that provides characters for them sadly mighty joe young wastes them both there are few clever moments although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment and as said the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes it certainly not bad film for kids doubt joe will give them nightmares but adults in the audience aren likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla big gorilla is only interesting for little while after that something needs to be done with the big gorilla nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla
spawn features good guys bad guys lots of fighting bloody violence leather clad machine gun chick gooey self healing bullet holes scatological humor and man eating monster it not only appears to have been tailor made for swarm of 12 and 13 year old boys it appears to have been made by them in classic example of telling and not showing spawn opens with truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness forces of light and how men are the ones who create evil on earth so much for message the movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons michael jai beyaz government assassin operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn martin sheen who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip while on top secret mission in north korean biological weapons plant simmons goes to hell and back after making deal with satan himself if he agrees to command the devil army to overtake the world he ll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda underused theresa randle and little girl cyan sydni beaudoin of course seeing as how five years has passed wanda has fallen for and married simmons partner sweeney his uh shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown john leguizamo disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan clown manipulates simmons now in superhuman spawn form into stand off with wynn wynn who thinks he is in league with the double dealing clown recognizes spawn as threat and undergoes an operation where bomb is placed on his heart when it stops beating major cities around the world will detonate causing the leak of disease that makes the ebola virus look like skin rash phew got all that it would be easy to dismiss spawn as just another one of those heavy on fx short on substance action pics but it doesn even work on that level the computer generated sequences are often and plenty and the problem is that they look too computer generated the several scenes set in hell present devil that looks and acts like video game graphic with the movie healthy budget you think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks other elements of the movie are so so spawn enormous kirmizi flowing cape is wonderful sight but it too obvious when he being played by costumed actor or an image in movies like contact the special effects serve the story in spawn they are the story and spawn himself isn even an interesting character the film reliance on razzle dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for but both simmons and his funky alter ego are completely underdeveloped what we need is batman luke skywalker even watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn poor leguizamo he starred in february the pest movie that still think is the year worst so far although this one does give it run for its money as clown he overacts to the extreme never missing an opportunity for poor taste punchline leguizamo farts green mist munches pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons mini skirt and performs cheerleader routine all before turning into giant grey demon the guy was brilliant in to wong foo thanks for everything julie newmar what is he doing wasting his talent in this and the pest one of the few people that liked batman robin this summer other big budget comic book film yet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison can only hope people will change their minds and think of batman as the superior adaptation there compelling story somewhere in spawn including strong religious overtones and the debut of the first african american superhero ever but it just not found anywhere near here as it is spawn is just awful it stinks worse than dead trout
in dreams might keep you awake at night but not because of its creepy imagery bizarre visual style or story about clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths no the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie brutally squandered potential the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise even by tired serial killer genre standards the big letdown however comes upon the realization that this 100 minute head scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan the man behind the crying game he no stranger to cinematic weirdness but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope things start out strong enough with cinematographer darius khondji stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of underwater ghost town during creepy prologue that establishes notably grim tone right off the bat this eerie opulence remains dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film there even something macabre about the way khondji photographs rustic seemingly innocent new england autumn but if there ever was film that didn deserve so good polish it this one don knock the look but say what you will about the foolish plot underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue annette bening another asset in dreams shouldn be so lucky to boast gives an increasingly effective performance in role that doesn do much for her in return she plays claire cooper massachusetts children book illustrator who plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children she thinks these visions are warning knell for horrible soon to be committed crimes but neither her ho hum husband aidan quinn nor the ho hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously this being thriller we know that she is in fact on the money and it credit to bening acting that she delves equally into claire madness and compassion but as soon as body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims in dreams trades in its nifty supernatural chills for long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense scenes pile up like car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition subplots appear and disappear when claire finally comes face to face with our evil murderer robert downey jr it turns out his name is vivian he clairvoyant and he got some major issues with mama la norman bates in dreams reaches its absurdist zenith here and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists some questions then what with the garbage disposal retching applesauce are the drawings on the wall blood or paint who cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own what about the computer does vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers why would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan is the woman in australia integral to anything and the aforementioned flooded city what function does that _really_ serve sigh at least in my own dreams can imagine better movie where certain talent didn go to waste
knock off is exactly that cheap knock off of an action movie it also the worst movie have seen thus far this year figured it would be at least couple of months before saw the worst film of 1998 but alas it has already been found jean claude van damme stars as think designer jeans executive who discovers his half brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods rob schneider plays van damme partner and rochon plays actually have no idea who rochon was supposed to be she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there many things are not explained in this film but do know that for some bizarre reason van damme seemed to be doing jackie chan impression throughout the flick where chan comes off as endearing in his normal guy character seen in many of his films van damme just comes off as wimp we re never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions to be more clear did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie and even then it was not made too clear the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong tsui hark who directed van damme last movie the bad but not nearly as bad as this double team never lets the camera rest for second and that no exaggeration we are even treated to five second shot from the point of view of van damme foot entering shoe fabulous seriously though have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions as long as they don get carried away for example look at sam raimi army of darkness one of his best movies features some of the most inventive camera work have ever seen but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story that concept that tsui can seem to grasp the special effects and outrageous camera angles rule knock off to the point where the audience doesn have clue as to what happening any more another problem with the film is that it looks cheap the film stock used is of such low caliber that thought was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night and for some inexplicable reason everyone voice seems to have been dubbed even the stars and even the special effects seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about are inconsistent for example there is scene in which van damme drives car out of window the car slams into the ground and the left wheel is completely destroyed seconds later the car drives off at full speed hey have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie but line must be drawn somewhere finally the acting nobody gives good performance in this film van damme an actor usually like is way off the mark playing everyman and schneider here to provide comic relief assume is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene even the usually solid paul sorvino gives terribly over the top performance as once again have no idea who he was supposed to be in case haven yet made it clear enough knock off is the worst movie of van damme career and possibly the worst movie of the decade and it not even one of those movies that so bad it funny it too inept to be funny there are no redeeming factors in knock off and seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased
snake eyes is the most aggravating kind of movie the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing it not just because this is brian depalma film and since he great director and one who films are always greeted with at least some fanfare and it not even because this was film starring nicolas cage and since he gives brauvara performance this film is hardly worth his talents it worse than that it aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more could be totally intelligent and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half assedness or more deservedly the hall of fame of the eighth assedness in certain circles snake eyes was being advertised as kind of modern day version of kurosawa classic rashomon where crime is told from the four different and mean different perspectives and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening which might add is superb in one very very very long steadicam shot we meet the protagonist crooked atlantic city detective rick santoro cage and follow him before boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife interupts pay per view event on tv chases down gambler enters the arena all pumped up for the fight sits down and talks with his bud kevin dunne gary sinise who character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn who also in this and watches as it happens there big name in the crowd and that the secretary of defense charles kirkland joel fabiani who sitting behind rick and who gets shot second after the heavyweight champion lincoln tyler stan shaw is knocked out this all happens in the opening shot and it creates so many kirmizi herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction what really happened this film asks and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene and discovers there very good possibility it was conspiracy as we follow rick trying to learn of more information we also meet woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot carla gugino and who flees the scene in panic and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness takes on what happened this is all going pretty fine and dandy and it extremely interesting to watch then it takes one wrong step we follow the wrong character and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on and way before rick can find it out but that not the worst part of it it that it the one person you didn think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the kirmizi herring the one you didn think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it it only gets worse the film turns into chase film about half way through the film and since we already know what happened we can rely on rick investigation to be all that interesting it as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about third of the way in and decided to just fall back on an easy way out and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible events become more and more proposterous and by the end the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this the deux ex machina that where some outside intereference brings the film to sudden conclusion and makes everything okay this time it hurricane an out of control police car and big round ball that adorned the arena what went wrong depalma and the screenwriter david koepp are extremely credible people in their respective fields and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this depalma who idolizes hitchcock to death has done many film like this such as his masterpiece blow out where movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover conspiracy piece by piece but granted depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch what with his over the top shot set ups notably the beginning and sequence where the camera pans over top of bunch of rooms in the hotel forgetting anything about boundaries at least his direction makes up partly for it then there koepp who showed such great ability at making character flaws come to life like he did in depalma earlier carlito way film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well he can write flawed character but his rick santoro seems to be just half assed effort he flawed and we can see redemption if the story wasn so formulaic scene towards the end where he has to make fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup he may as well have said the opposite of what he says it would have at least gone with what the character was like this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity because it promises disection of flawed character and perhaps even redemption then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way as was watching the first half hour couldn wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed how many different perspectives he be given and perhaps he have to make choice between who he has to believe now there film unfortunately the film has two major deux ex machinas one in the disasterous ending the other about half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes stale and recycled piece of crap we ve seen all too much before but never from someone like depalma
forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects set in 1692 at salem massachusetts the crucible opens with group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around boiling cauldron in the middle of forest under the glow of full moon they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor daniel day lewis abigail winona ryder suddenly seizes chicken beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood taking even adolescent hormone surges into account surely this chicken bashing bit is bit excessive especially for prim puritan sensibilities surely to the puritan eye this is as close to coven of witches as it gets the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play this is far from harmless event bad start to an already shaky morality tale the play describes the film opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply and this adds to the play charged atmosphere in the film the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora box not only is credulity stretched but abigail obsession is unfortunately spotlighted it positions the crucible more as cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts it will bring back the memory of rabbit boiling away in pot not surprisingly the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning witches are invoked by those eager to blame when the girls are questioned their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses led lustfully by abigail with alarming synchronicity our hormonally advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents constant reminders that abigail passion sets all this into inexorable motion abigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor love his wife elizabeth joan allen by including her among those accused of witchcraft appropriately narrow waisted and equipped with distractingly beyaz smile watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to murky yellow day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over earnestness that longs to be watched director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis foaming mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on pedestal for our admiration otherwise hytner direction is unremarkable ryder performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings her fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful abigail supposedly revels in her newfound power but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here paul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing allen elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character scene near the end featuring private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed unfortunately when john audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost it is clear that miller meant well but do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions his screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message the result is clumsy muddle felt like the chicken from the opening scene head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy handed to be wholly believable when the gallows beckoned it was sweet release indeed far from bewitching the crucible tests the patience
one might expect cathartic viewing experience walking into new jean luc godard film after all he was founding member of the highly influential french new wave he is also an esteemed film critic lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing however his latest creation in praise of love is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit to dissect love into the following four categories meeting physical passion quarrels and reconciliation these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples young adult and elderly it is edgar bruno putzulu self appointed task to capture these moments after recent breakup to define central idea it only when things are over that they make sense whether this project will end up play film or opera remains undecided the thesis is simple enough that if played right it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone instead what ensues is an hour and half of repetitive vignettes the next scene no more engaging than the last only once does any character utter something worthwhile but by the time it happens you re so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it but don fret it will surface again you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film as some fellow critics did and wake up in scene exactly like the one you nodded off in not having missed anything worthwhile but you hold hope for some time the background music keeps you in state of urgency and even suspense for the first few conversations it only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope and with speeches like am thinking of something but can only think of that something when am thinking of something else how can you expect to hold anyone interest to godard credit he certainly knows how to frame scene the siyah and beyaz footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful watching edgar read while walking along train track on mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him and if this film had anything poignant to say you would have which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities the environments be it city or country are impeccably captured in crisp detail but the script never complements them unfortunately godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to siyah numerous times within any given scene sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words the second half is composed of nauseating hyper color that often blurs the image you suddenly feel like doomed character straight out of scanners the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies steven spielberg is picked on in particular while ll grant that this does happen and tend to shy away from watching such garbage it still pointless focus for film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood it just goes to show an intelligent person isn necessarily an admirable storyteller the days of breathless are no more
america loves convenience after all we re the culture that invented the cell phone the 24 hour atm and my most beloved the remote control yet perhaps this time with ghosts of mars we have taken our love of convenience to far ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as tough as nails pill poppin martian cop sent with her squadron to retrieve demolition williams ice cube from remote mining town for trial back home when she and her comrades appropriately dubbed the commander the rookies and the guy with the cool accent discover the town residents slaughtered they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents head chopping alien possessed clutches filled with lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks flashes sideways and viewpoint changes ghosts of mars is hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill conceived action sequences the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story ripped straight from the pages of 1970s zombie movie ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced most of these moments come off as kwik mart wisdom dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even tempered streetwise hand of ice cube with gun in one hand and dynamite cap in the other cube reminisces about his street life comparing the zombie stomping fun to me and my brother when we was kids apparently crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment but even in the film darkest moments fate conveniently lends hand supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite yes in the future man may travel to space and conquer mars but nothing beats good stick of tnt and as we all know every police station past present or future keeps healthy supply on hand characters die heads are lopped off but they were only supporting roles anyway so why should we care as long as you have plenty of narcotics immunity is guaranteed eventually though even the most well trained zombie alien gets bit uppity and needs to be taught lesson what better way than by sacrificing few minor characters to convenient nuclear detonation killing anything the machine guns can handle explosions are fun and even if the nukes don get them the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will in the end this film defines itself when our cop tribunal pronounces is that all you have to tell us for indeed john carpenter has run out of things to say and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell ridiculously bad story
follow up to disney live action 101 dalmatians that better more entertaining than the first just as unlikely with 102 dalmatians the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs more is definitely not the merrier 1996 101 dalmatians certainly wasn the greatest movie going experience of all time but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous larger than life performance in addition we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen and close facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53 year old actress under that startling siyah and beyaz wig of hers but that only half the problem with kevin lima laborious film what makes 102 dalmatians such collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor here almost single handedly foisted on wisecracking macaw who thinks he dog voiced by eric idle its rabid plotlessness cruella goes after puppies again winds up in goo again and most of all the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic heroes of the piece welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander than bland alice evans as parole officer named chlo gruffudd is cute and harmless perhaps but evans can even aspire to that the dogs upstage them both of course but in the case of evans even close split ends are more animated bad acting however seems to be requirement for this sequel since rard depardieu shows up as french furrier with haircut like robert de niro in men of honor jean pierre le pelt is flamboyant fashion designer with penchant for fine furs and depardieu over the top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail and wail for wail france most popular export besides brie has long since turned into caricature of himself and in 102 dalmatians the producers milk that realization for all it worth le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as poopies par example and ad nauseum the finesses of the script attributed to four screenwriters no less and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up are quickly dispensed with since all it takes for paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben that done it back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off limits sables and minks and plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of hooded designer gown the dogs are pretty cute try making puppy look otherwise but that pretty much all they are there always the feeling that there trainer off in the wings coaxing the dogs to open doors or pick up their food bowls in unison or pop tape into the videocasette recorder savvy holiday goers should skip 102 dalmatians and pop the original 1961 animated classic into their vcrs instead it one dalmatian less but 101% more satisfying
some movies should just skip my daughter and had really vile time at my favorite martian few weeks back and here comes another disney effects filled live action flick based on an old tv program true the probgram is only 15 years old this time and it cartoon but it cartoon liked and was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen but my daughter really wanted to go and how bad could it be turns out was right mostly inspector gadget oddly enough follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian down to the jive talking side kick at first thought it was done by the same people but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it where formula isn just business it way of life the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits in some parts you can just hear them saying more zany want more zany here and here let have really painful sexual reference for no reason right here make it really painful want the audience squirming in their seats ok that fine but want you to add bug guts what does this scene do character depth but where the zaniness don see zany here if you can make it zany cut it the latter is the only explanation can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie michelle who plays penny gadget niece shines in every scene she in but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor dabney coleman comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film but instead he does the best he can with some really poor lines in few unexceptional scenes he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the gidget bitch from hell town mayor oteri overly enthusiastic and continually self congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland oregon own manic mayor vera katz that had to wonder if the studio wasn poking fun at our fair town or maybe all career politicians are like that must say matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla he appears to have some fun with the film especially as the evil gadget rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film hughley plays the shuckin and jivin vehicular side kick in role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years the dialog is let face it it pretty bad the tag line after major set piece battle is faux pas that makes no sense in context lot of the lines especially hughley appear to be made up as they go along by people with little gift for ad lib about three quarters of the film is somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations not really battles with the evil gadget penny does about minute and half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon let me rage here just for minute michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character she utterly charming and has excellent experience harriet the spy for the part of the pint size detective why she is so underutilized in this film is real mystery the film loses star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting or editing stupidity inspector gadget is missing the long long stretches of potty humor that among other things made my favorite martian so unbearable but it very short movie so perhaps something was cut at the last moment probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits the evil sidekick support group is especially worth seeing and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it onscreen all in all another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films wonder if disney uses the revenues for it generally money making cartoons to produce these losers but if true why if they re trying for another mary poppins they need to find team that can produce one and then give them chance to do it
hong kong cinema has been going through bad spell the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films in nutshell the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership lot of hong kong best talents have crossed the pacific to work on productions such talents as jackie chan rush hour chow yun fat anna the king the corrupter and yuen woo ping the matrix have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai unfortunately romeo must die bears all the trademarks of typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong rhythms the film opens in nightclub as an asian couple is necking enter group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing russell wong kai confronts po sing jon kit lee the son of kai boss and leader of the local chinese family battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai who handily kicks and punches his opponents down it not until club owner silk rapper dmx bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends the following morning po sing is found dead suspicions escalate as issac day delroy lindo is told of the murder his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into legitimate venture issac implores his chief of security mac issiah washington to watch after his son and daughter the scene shifts to prison in china where han sing jet li learns of his brothers murder he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined hung upside down by one foot han recovers and battle his way out of custody in blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work escaping to the han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother death romeo must die is in many ways fun film it is both absurd and assured the basic plot of gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes the godfather the relationship between jet li han and aaliyah trish day reminds us of abel ferrera china girl except that romeo must die couple never once exchange more than loving glance towards one another their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable li of course has the showiest part having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination allayah in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with certain style and grace it obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic but still the part is under written in such way that even poor performance would not have affected it delro lindo as issac day carries himself well in the film an unsung and under appreciated actor mr lindo turns out the films best performance the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for woodside as issac son colin the performance is undirected with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and or better written first time director andrzej bartkowiak does workmanlike job in handling the film having career as one of the industry best cinematographers bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots and romeo must die does look good but the pacing of the film is lethargic only coming to semblance of life during the fight scenes the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of sports center for nfl team is needlessly confusing and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah bodyguard maurice has no comic timing whatsoever the best things about the film are its fight scenes jet li is master of these intricate physical battles one needs only to see his film fist of legend to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat here jet is given the opportunity to show off in way that lethal weapon jet debut didn allow unfortunately lot of jet fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision also romeo must die must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film and that is an ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent obviously homage to the famed ray scene from sonny chiba streetfighter the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film it as if the film has stopped and video game has been inserted one problem though about the fight scenes those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon they do have an internal rhythm to them heartbeat so to speak in their choreography the fight scenes in hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance this is created by the performance the direction and the editing here in romeo must die there is no staccato every fight scene even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows set pattern the rhythm is monotonous hong kong film has tempo that changes heightening its emotional impact rmd is limited to standard tempo not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever fine example of this difference can be found by examining couple of jackie chan films watch the restaurant fight from the film rush hour and notice that the context of the fight while technically amazing is rather flat the framing and cut always do not help now look at the warehouse fight from rumble in the bronx there you have heartbeat and emotional draw that doesn let the audience catch its breath the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted here in romeo must die the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl jet li is grand and personable screen presence it shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here one day filmmakers here in the will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such commodity until then we ll be left with emotionally hollow product like the replacement killer and currently romeo must die
if you re into watching near on two hours of bored foul mouthed florida teens having sex doing drugs having sex listening to eminem having sex playing video games having sex and killing one of their peers then bully for you based on jim schutze novelization of true life event bully charts the story of handful of disenchanted teenagers who in 1993 murdered their high school bully in cold calculated blood the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers in the hands of controversial director larry clark kids however it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker pornographic proclivities in terms of the incident and what provoked it bully stirs up nothing new the high schoolers are presented as uniformly screwed up lot bored with life not much ambition promiscuous profane the bully in question bobby kent nick stahl is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department he hounds and harries and humiliates his best friend marty played by brad renfro and marty girlfriend lisa rachel miner doesn care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby simply remove him from the equation marty and lisa and handful of their promiscuous profane and stoner friends plus recruited hit man lure bobby to swamp one night stab him beat him over the head with baseball bat and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators presumably finish him off there no remorse the next day they re talking about it as openly as homework assignment they did it because they wanted to and because they could what most troubling about the film however isn the unsettling subject matter and the matter of fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in bully but there also an uneasy exploitative feel to it gratuitous crotch shots abound one of which makes the zipper cut away in there something about mary look like the height of subtlety clark is so pre occupied with his female predominantly leads that you forget at times what this movie is supposed to be about the stripping bare literally and figuratively of these actors who are after all playing underage teenagers becomes harder to watch over time as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera the conclusion of bully offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime it short sequence of stills heather years ali 40 years lisa life imprisonment for example but it infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it bully aims for truth exploits it shamelessly then bludgeons it to death

among multitude of erotic thrillers that had been released in the early 1990s woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty star of the grade action films of the previous decade those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star as director ginty did very little to improve that impression the protagonist of the movie is jack played by jeff fahey yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford played by bo derek however she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby steven bauer one stormy night the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder however his good friend walter hill robert mitchum happens to be very good lawyer so jack might even prove his innocence in the end belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots unfortunately this film isn comedy and any laugh is unintentional the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them the actors that play them don help either that is especially the case with jeff fahey whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like genius in comparison his partner bo derek on the other hand shows that she didn age enough to cease being the sex goddess but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents ginty on the other hand tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer
lake placid marks yet another entry in the series of predator pics that were screen staple in the late 1970s post jaws and were revived recently by the godawful anaconda placid claims to be horror comedy it directed by the same guy who did house but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of anaconda paleontologist kelly scott bridget fonda is sent up to maine to examine tooth removed from body that had been bitten in half on the lake discovering that the tooth belongs to crocodile which shouldn even be in this hemisphere kelly goes croc hunting with game warden jack wells bill pullman and sheriff hank keough brendan gleeson they re joined by an unwelcome guest hector cyr oliver platt scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them along the way the merry band meets mrs delores bickerman betty beyaz weird old lady who lives out on the lake you know what to expect from this movie lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator croc cam swimming toward someone dangling legs while jaws like music plays one character hector who obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest another character who insists that the predator can possibly exist unlike its slippery cousin anaconda lake placid wants to present its formulaic plot tongue in cheek which is self defeating the result is neither scary nor funny it just tedious while director steve miner has several horror films on his resume including two installments of friday the 13th and halloween h20 screenwriter david kelley best known as the creator of tv series like ally mcbeal and chicago hope doesn seem to have the stomach for chomp em up flick the body count is surprisingly low and doesn include any of the major characters and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it lake placid manages to have it both ways ll let you discover how for yourself the croc itself is mostly computer generated of course like the snake in anaconda the thirty foot monster crocodile doesn seem real it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural lake placid also offers little explanation for why giant crocodile is in maine there is lot of semi mystical mumbo jumbo about how we really don know much about crocodiles they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers movie like this doesn have to offer much of an explanation radioactive mutant creature from outer space but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on pullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto pilot most of the time they re probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers platt and beyaz on the other hand seem to be giving their best efforts and they manage to squeeze few chuckles out of this sorry script
capsule where are you tonight leni rienfenstal starship troopers is an expensive hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography and bad pornography at that it is not good cinema not good storytelling and not even stupid fun it so cynically calculatedly bone headed that even the least demanding members of the audience was with were alternately bored and revulsed it one of the worst movies ve seen in long time why am calling this movie pornography pornography in the abstract is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts remember reading review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper as near pornographic eternity didn agree with that assessment but could see what was being implied the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout do er man do er that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers it literally like giant recruitment film that has gone berserk it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening the film takes place in our future when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn appear to have intelligence to counterattack humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable instead of nuke the planet from orbit which they re clearly capable of they send down grunts with 16 rifles this isn heinlein it bad wwii movie one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy repetitive and ultimately tiresome one scene has journalist on battlefield filimg soldiers being slaughtered and ends with groaning predictability said cameraman gets skewered too the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic they do not possess germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense they don even behave like soldiers in bad movie and therefore we don care about them we hated the tom berenger character in platoon but he mattered and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate here we don even hate the bugs what there to hate hating them would be like cursing hurricaine if there anything really hateful there the movie doesn know how to give it to us the screenwriter ed neumeier perhaps better appelation would be screen typist and director the increasingly talent impaired paul verhoeven have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other one of the subplots concerns woman pilot who great at getting out of tight situations and does it again and again and again once or twice is fine by the fifth or sixth time it worn out its welcome there never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything or really being tested to show their mettle also the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry if bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing damned thing but if one human gets cornered he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip uh huh the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi fascist flavor say quasi because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action the gear the uniforms etc the movie doesn have the nerve or the brains to be genuinely fascist or intelligent about the subject the bumpers between scenes which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison like the rest of the movie there more suppose but it not worth it the acting is bland neither arsenic nor gravy the music disposable the camerawork turgid the heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like masterpiece
the classic story the production which ruined it marking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 wells classic new line cinema armed with stellar cast and expert make up effects man stan winston alien predator terminator etc churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel of course the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier movies one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 under the title the island of lost souls sounds like much better title the story begins with edward douglas thewlis un representative sent to oversee peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery kilmer after his plane crashes into the sea douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr moreau who incidently owns the island and also reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize his host reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau lab when monstrous birth was in progress even worse the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal people douglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast people community which considers dr moreau their maker using shock therapy and the law dr moreau has long been able to keep his beast people civilised to some extent but there are few animal men who are just too savage to be controlled the island of dr moreau questions the ability of men playing god dr moreau is man obsessed with creating race of beings which is free from hate and violence but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long moreau has no doubt very interesting premise within its grasp even so the production has failed to make the most out of it there are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is the characters are not prioritized so when the audience is led to believe that particular character is important before they know it he or she or it perishes rather ungloriously at times too perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people especially aissa balk the most human of moreau creations the two very important characters montgomery and dr moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably more screen time could have been used for character interaction and development really would have liked it better if say they delved more into dr moreau obsession montgomery purpose in the story and justification to as why the beast people had to rebel maybe the nature of the screenplay which incidently does not incorporate much action sequences in the film forced the filmmakers to cut long story short and make it more of an action film than anything else it still summer and movies have to be marketable the special effects too are really nothing for anyone to shout about at most would say the beast men looked just bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes this wells classic really has potential to be good film unfortunately after adaptations they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story as third outing the island of dr moreau accomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of `the planet of the apes the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey cold uninvolving confusing new thriller though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard author of out of sight as well as jackie brown get shorty and pulp fiction after you watch it you realize that it not nearly good enough in an aggressively non linear fashion the limey li mey noun an english gentleman tells the story of wilson terrence stamp british ex con just released from year stint in prison for armed robbery he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny he doesn know much about the circumstances of her demise all he has is name terry valentine valentine was jenny former boyfriend wealthy and corrupt record executive he played by peter fonda in his first major role since the terrific ulee altin in 1997 seeking valentine reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having big party he winds up breaking his cover eventually setting off valentine head of security and valentine himself who decides to run for it what mess have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time pulp fiction which twisted time every which way was masterpiece but do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer the limey does exactly that the plot is permeated with flashbacks flash forwards and what can only be described as random time travel without any evident purpose there is no method to this movie madness it uses fancy way to tell story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably the plot isn particularly interesting in the first place traditional mildly hackneyed and not very involving this is sort of brooding film our protagonist doesn speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude felt like the director wasn very interested in the proceedings himself almost like he made this film for paycheck ditto for the editing which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal he not much in the way of stature but he has surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor he shy quiet but always effective he adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression his feelings don always show on his face by you can always tell what they are this is basically conventional thriller told in pretentiously bizarre fashion why soderbergh couldn just parrot down and tell story don know but what he does do certainly doesn work the result is wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil even the action scenes don work 1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one act two act three storyline but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it shall we go back to basics
pseudo intellectual film about the pseudo intellectual world of art magazines high art is as wasted as its drug addled protagonists in the only notable part of the movie ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles not that lisa cholodenko script or direction makes you care much about either character living in world of heroin induced highs they float along until they fall in love with each other this uninviting picture full of pretentious minor characters has receptionist that reads dostoevski and woman in the restroom line who is certified genius having recently been awarded prestigious mcarthur grant 24 year old syd radha mitchell who has rather bland live in boyfriend was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine frame although the receptionist is impressed syd is mainly gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ally sheedy for her to do photos for frame lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her since lucy fancies her lucy lives with her current lover washed up german actress named greta played with frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson the two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope usually heroin this does not happen in single episode but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture syd who lives in the apartment below them joins in on the fun and becomes member of the zombie club lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs which apparently is funded by her mother lucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being pigeonholed and since her mother has money we can only assume that that how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses typical scene has the editors arguing about whether potential photographer work is transcendental or merely classical that no one has clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny your work has cultural currency that is important now is the artist speak that the frame manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine when the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd her idea of romantic line is want to get high with you in lucy world sex and drugs come hand in hand and the movie except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing shows drug usage as being hip and natural part of the art scene this vacuous picture throws in standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions in another movie it might have worked but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted high art runs 36 it is rated for explicit sex pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age
party camp is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies ve seen in awhile late rip off of the meatballs series the film follows group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk that really about all that can be said about the plot because nothing much happens except that the main character wise cracking jerry andrew ross has the hots for cute blonde kerry brennan and there is big contest in the climax how fun since party camp has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative it not that think exploitation is necessarily good quality but when you are talking about dull turkey like this the least that could have been done would be to fill it with lot of mindless sex even psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick at least then it wouldn have been such chore to sit through never before have seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat the comedy was easy to spot but it wasn the least bit funny it was groan inducing constantly throghout was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything so what saves party camp from the dreaded zero star rating well that simple jewel shepard as flighty bimbo was admittedly fun to watch although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash at least if the film had centered on shepard she might have been able to add little spice to an otherwise rancid low budget teen comedy
when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy expect negative reviews from critics left and right predictable unoriginal and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you and the drive me crazy released by the dozens these last couple of years what really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while sitting in the theater am enjoying myself is this comfortable break from my week of finals this is why have given films like final destination or road trip high marks had party of time wasting my money on something won remember next week so last week opened up the new york times and no surprise boys and girls got negative review daily news negative reelviews negative epinions com negative this was nothing new american pie final destination road trip didn get such hot reviews and loved those guilty pleasures same goes for she all that formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded since boys and girls reunites she all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr predicted vu al over again but still curious asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it the reactions were far from positive had made up my mind ll catch it on video or cable in couple of years but soon after following series of unexpected events we couldn get into shaft because it is rated found myself watching boys and girls whoops boys and girls is about nerdy smart boy named ryan prinze jr and popular flirt girl named jennifer claire forlani briefly meeting as pre teens and now attending the same college the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends but in the movies male and female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other with advice from their roommates amanda detmer jason biggs ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons the dialogue is probably the worst have ever seen in any movie mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to it is almost offensive an example of an insightful conversation you re dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb no followed by mandy moore esque tune background well it not as bad as wing commander guess the supporting cast is also painfully useless detmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring pointless subplots and although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex prinze jr ryan dominates the screen while forlani jennifer simply acts as dilemma for him to work with we never learn anything about jennifer which is shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character teenager or not you ll hate this movie guarantee it maybe should rent she all that again is it really as good as think it is
all through its production and into the early days of its initial aborted pre release publicity hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood ultimately however paramount pictures nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996 other underperforming disaster films dante peak volcano changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly year but to paraphrase the bard swill by any other name would smell as rank no number of name changes can help this picture it not just about disaster it is disaster hard rain is the case of movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute the best shot occurs during the opening credits as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg indiana as the water level slowly rises the community protected by an overworked dam is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud choked skies from that moment on it all downhill whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point it takes forever to get to the end credits this is one of the longest seeming 95 minute motion pictures have recently endured basically hard rain is one extended dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot outs there lot of water broken glass gunfire and explosions it all very routine and uninteresting because there aren any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense the film conclusion is so preposterous that it almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards conclusion graham yost the writer of both speed and hard rain surely understands that principle unfortunately neither he nor cinematographer turned director mikael salomon far off place applies it the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition we see the same kinds of things speedboat chases flood damage shoot outs etc over and over again the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length the storyline gives us number of paper thin characters in contrived circumstances there tom christian slater the one dimensional action hero who works as security guard driving an armored car full of cash he and his partner charlie edward asner tv lou grant get stuck on street that rapidly turning into river group of men led by jimmy morgan freeman arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers after charlie is killed in shoot out tom hides the money then runs as he swims and boats his way through huntingburg roads he encounters some of the locals karen minnie driver would be love interest bickering old couple richard dysart and betty beyaz who are on hand to provide comic relief and the easily corrupted sheriff randy quaid whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives there isn any real acting in this film christian slater utters few lame one liners and does lot of mugging for the camera tom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen randy quaid sneers lot and is totally unconvincing morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances but they are defeated by the script freeman one of the best cinematic thespians working today looks suitably embarrassed to be here but suppose everyone needs good paycheck from time to time following in the wake of twister this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn trust nature fury as the chief engine of conflict as result we are saddled with an idiotic good guys bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had titanic proved that there can be wealth of drama in movie where everything goes under water hard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible thus far this year hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire firestorm and water hard rain fortunately there are only two elements left
instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as powerful or touching have name for it myself gross this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to bully the bully looks at the rebel threateningly about to hurt him and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me aren present day moviegoers beyond being inspired by something like that this is one example there are actually some more in instinct alone of filmmakers insulting the audience intelligence instinct plot is brimming with potential world renowned anthropologist ethan powell anthony hopkins disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa he was found and is coming back to the united states convicted killer he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him after committing few more brutal acts of violence in the airport the authorities stick him in prison psychotics ward assigned to do an evaluation on powell is bright or so we are told young psychiatrist theo caulder cuba gooding jr caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career of course and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not psychotic and that he should not be in prison and then there the inevitable heartless meanie character in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder mentor he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell let get one thing straight dr theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist have ever seen on screen or off any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn great deal about his patient that way not good old theo no he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says we need to talk about this right now this is flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct already dubious credibility unfortunately it also the least of its problems director jon turteltaub who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that contrary to what this movie promotion would have you believe it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs it not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus excuse the graphic depiction it aims to inspire rather than to touch hearts as yoda would say inspire it does not it is the ultimate sign of futility when screenwriter the very experienced gerald di pego has to resort to literally telling the audience movie story indeed somewhere in the beginning of instinct one of the characters actually reads aloud the film plot to another character this like the instance mentioned in the first paragraph of this review is horrid insult to our intelligence am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors and he chews the scenery in this movie brilliant as ever oscar winner cuba gooding jr on the other hand is dreadful his performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being shrink liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling love animals and instinct prominent save the gorillas live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something could sympathize with however this movie execution is completely unacceptable tone down the violence and this will be chick flick 1999 eugene novikov
sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades like twelve angry men serpico or the verdict but in the same time almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet reputation stranger among us 1992 rip off of peter weir witness belongs to the latter category the heroine of this movie is emily eden melanie griffith tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york during one of such actions her partner nick jamey sheridan got hurt and as result she becomes depressed in order to help her recover bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community she decides to go undercover that isn easy because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel eric thal using peter weir formula isn the greatest flaw of this film even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent but the worst insult to viewer audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith the author of this review never liked this actress very much but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles role of emily eden unfortunately isn one of them first of all she can pass for tough nypd street fighter and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn much better screenplay by robert avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic kirmizi herring subplots scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch but on the other hand other actors are more convincing lee richardson as an old rabbi thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community also the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time
the world on land it just too big for me starring tim roth pruitt taylor vince bill nunn clarence williams iii rated the legend of 1900s is the year most absurd movie rambling nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth looking wistful as ever as guy named 1900 you heard right his name is in all actuality 1900 he was born on an ocean liner on 1900 uh hence the name abandoned and adopted by danny ship crewman 1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny fear that he might be taken away from him because of visa matters well when 1900 is about or so he starts wondering all around the ship one day he discovers grand piano he sits down and starts playing miraculously what comes out is beautiful group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such young age when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is totally against regulations 1900 replies ck the regulations ho ho ho 1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land when he about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody business onboard comes another musician his name is max pruitt taylor vince and he plays the trumpet after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during storm he sits him down on the piano next to him takes the piano braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall taking them with it how the chair they re sitting on and the piano don separate don know but this apparently isn the kind of thing we re supposed to ask after that 1900 and max become friends max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land but 1900 has no intention of doing so what more he doesn even want his music to go anywhere without him when record company hears about his talents they come on board to make record of his music but after finding out that gasp they re going to make millions of copies he breaks the record the conflict of the movie is that after max unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship gets off himself he stumbles upon record of 1900 music in store the record shouldn exist because 1900 never stepped on dry land and the one record that was made on the ship was broken ladies and gentlemen it mystery the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements we re supposed to be roused by climactic piano duel there isn anything in this movie with the potential to compel 1900 comes off as whiny brooding extremely unlikable man can recall single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo meditation on life ditto for max who doesn seem to have life outside his friendship with 1900 tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as fig leaf there no spirit no gusto to the character he insists that he leads happy life on the ship but to us he is dead pruitt taylor vince is little more palatable at least providing moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up bit the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant leering king of jazz who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel the legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered masterpiece by many this effort is utterly limp and lifeless at once ridiculous boring narrow sighted and pointless this is one movie that should be and will be quickly forgotten
my giant is two movies for the price of one but neither is worth the cost of admission even if you get in free as lamely directed by michael lehmann the picture tries to be comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book without goliath david is just some punk throwing rocks languidly paced throughout the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer the omen meanders toward its sad ending since it rarely funny or convincingly dramatic what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains mystery other than few nice visuals there nothing to recommend the picture with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally to the original city slickers billy crystal has shown that he more than the world best oscar host he does however have propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year father day and this year my giant one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with project surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success or maybe he wants to be dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie somber tone the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day this one joke movie single idea is to place real life basketball player gheorghe muresan who stands seven and half feet tall into as many visually striking situations as possible sammy crystal an agent currently without clients is rescued after car accident by sweet romanian giant named max muresan after throwing out constant one liners either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car sammy decides to get serious seeing max as his meal ticket and although he doesn like it he willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like wrestling match with half dozen dwarfs the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever after series of missed opportunities the comedic part of the movie is over and it turns into cheap and maudlin disease movie we learn that max condition is terminal and he will soon die to be fair the movie does contain few good scenes all of which you can see in the trailers let hope billy gets himself pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie my giant runs too long even at just 37 it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up my son jeffrey and his friend matthew both gave the movie single star and had nothing good to say about it matthew pointed out that it is not as good as it could have been or should have been amen he went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was
this feature is like double header two sets of clich for the price of one not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts but the banal rich girl poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure an original moment in this loser is as rare as chicago cubs world series appearance the screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins based on story by falls merely lobs its plotline at the audience this is story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching summer catch centers around ryan dunne freddie prinze jr cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league supposedly showcase for the best young amateur and college players in the country ryan is blue collar kind of guy he works with his dad taking care of the lawns of cape cod rich and famous he also as we are informed early his own worst enemy he has the potential and the talent but always seems to self destruct at the crucial moment so ryan tries to remained focused on baseball then he meets tenley parrish jessica biel daughter of one of the mavi bloods whose lawn he manicures tenley name only hack screenwriter could invent is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan if you can figure out where all this nonsense leads then you need remedial course in film viewing as always prinze is pretty to look at but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions puppy dog love heartbreak frustration self loathing or determination biel cries lot while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class conscious father the only beacon is matthew lillard fun loving billy brubaker the team catcher summer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies such as bull durham and the natural no curve balls here no sliders every pitch is predictable blind umpire could call this movie summer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking it has as much chance of making the movie hall of fame as the dodgers have of moving back to brooklyn
one of the responses those that enjoy detroit rock city probably kiss fans mostly might have upon first glance at the rating ve given the film might be something like oh that casey gone and become jaded critic on us just what did he expect out of dumb teenage rock roll movie like this wondering the same thing feel like should have had grand time with detroit rock city it the sort of movie wish could ve had lot of fun with but didn just didn surely this film isn trying to win any major awards so should have expected an oscar caliber film no but expected something funny joke clever prank plot development anything the movie never delivers you ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with movie that is truly about nothing detroit rock city is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film existence and it not very satisfying realization the film is about four teenage boys all huge kiss fans from cleveland trying to get into kiss concert in detroit michigan that it there is no big plot description in this review because the movie has very little plot the characters are hawk edward furlong lex giuseppe andrews trip james debello and jam sam huntington they have garage band they re pathetic like all garage bands but they like kiss and they like rock roll so guess that means we root for them they have tickets they lose them they get more tickets they lose those too they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets most of which backfire there not much more to it frankly it becomes little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film when total of eight tickets have already graced the boys hands only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity oh and jam real name jeremiah has really really annoying ultra religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency she doesn want them to see kiss if you hadn figured that out already it really quite disheartening to see such fine soundtrack go to waste in pointless movie like this we ve got plenty of kiss along with some ac dc ramones and thin lizzy then again maximum overdrive had an awesome soundtrack me being the big ac dc fan that am but is probably one of the worst movies of all time detroit rock city doesn quite reach that level of ineptitude but it gets dangerously close in fact the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being complete failure in my mind basically the soundtrack has earned the film full half star which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back except for marilyn manson whose half hearted cover of ac dc highway to hell sounds like something my neighbor cat coughed up it also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste because it evident that they re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of movie edward furlong has done far better work than this and so has natasha lyonne and so has lin shaye but hey they ve got to make living in hollywood people wanting to see kiss and lots of it will probably be disappointed considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song too bad they might have provided some energy to this mess director adam rifkin knows he hasn got much material to work with so he takes chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning we get an endless parade of quick cuts split screens zoom outs zoom ins and rotating cameras all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script it fun for while but eventually it becomes disorienting would recommend that those who felt seasick at the blair witch project stay far away from detroit rock city because the witch has got nothing on this baby haven felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since armageddon and what about that script it written by carl dupr which sounds like as made up name as ve ever heard if it is can say blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible plotless pointless rock roll movie can be fun if the jokes and gags are actually funny the jokes in detroit rock city rarely are in fact the only time really laughed was when priest gets stoned on marijuana laced pizza and that was just because it was so surreal the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it comedy there is no set up just succession of punchlines that don provide for much in the way of chuckles precisely because there was no set up it as if they just whacked someone on the head pointed at him and said see funny look that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink see funny look that guy just got clocked by telephone receiver twice see funny look that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money see funny word of advice to mr dupr no these things aren funny all by themselves they must be preceded by clever set up so the audience hasn predicted them five minutes in advance that it ve said enough about this movie it waste of time and money liked the music but don bother buying the soundtrack hear it just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie you want to see this concept executed well go rent roger corman 1979 classic rock roll high school it features another late seventies rock band the ramones and far more interesting story about girl trying to get tickets to their show yes go rent that and skip detroit rock city which will probably bomb and deservedly so
funny how your expectations can be defeated and not in good ways the ghost and the darkness promised at least it seemed to me to promise hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000 level material an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters get new jobs was one line if remember correctly at the end of the 19th century col patterson val kilmer whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr is an engineer who has been hired to build british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda he is having immensely stereotypical problems the natives are restless his boss is jerk and now two man eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off patterson tries to handle the situation himself incompetently and then turns to charles remington michael douglas hunter of world reknown or something like that the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions they should have gotten top billing and co starred with siegfried and roy they are nigh invulnerable as one comic book put it and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature give me break the movie hasn got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas it just trying to find convenient ways to stall us even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic get this remington big plan is to build large scaffold like structure in the middle of the savannah sit on it and wait for the lion to show up he does this and then gets knocked off by bird by the end of the movie the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand the acting is forgettable douglas does good job of portraying relatively cracked fellow but it nothing he hasn done before kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else somewhere else and the rest vanish into the cinematography the camera by the way sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent what did expect from this movie dunno some real excitement suppose sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation no such luck dug out my tattered copy of hemingway the short happy life of francis macomber and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind
unfortunately it doesn get much more formulaic than one tough cop there the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film bo dietl pronounced deedle baldwin is one tough cop guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia on top of that problem he has drunk gambling addicted partner penn who has penchant for collecting parking tickets guess cops aren immune then throw into the mix the femme fatale gershon right there you have plenty of ammo for decent cop drama but right in the middle of the film they throw in completely un related plot point dietl and his partner duke try to solve case that they have been warned to stay away from the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of nun who was beaten and raped to near death once the case is solved the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as mafioso an insult if you ask me the performances were pretty good baldwin though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec does fine job as one tough cop penn who also slips into an impression of his brother sean is even better as loser tough guy cop what one tough cop lacks is originality this film offers nothing new nothing that you can get from any cop film it screams sidney lumet all over the place perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman producers of lumet dog day afternoon and serpico but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into good film too much else is lacking also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture something that almost never notice but once saw that had it in the back of my mind every time saw medium or long shot at times was hoping to see it one tough cop isn laughable nor is it terrible film but it just isn unique it is classic example of film that didn need to be made but one thing is for sure it could really use better title
supposedly based on true story in which the british drive to build rail bridge deep in africa grinds to halt after pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898 john patterson val kilmer the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation tried to rid his operation of the lions but fails world renound hunter remington michael douglas is called in and the battle man against lion begins this film has great soundtrack and wonderful scenery the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin we only see one side of each character kilmer is bridge builder and that all we see him as these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesn even appear to be too upset about it and the plot it jaws but with lions again we re presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should it appears to kill men because it just likes too why who knows guess there wouldn be much of story if it didn the problem is that there isn much of story even though it does
of course knew this going in why is it that whenever tv star makes movie it always romantic comedy and then they say on entertainment tonight or something that they were attracted to the characters they were really original original let me give you run through of picture perfect character kate jennifer aniston from tv friends smart beautiful professional woman wants two things she can have new job title and the love of her co worker kevin bacon her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets mortgage and gets lease on german sportscar and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls what does she do she invents fiance then when everyone wants to meet him she tells some poor schmoe she met at wedding that she will pay him $1000 to pretend to be in love with her for company dinner and pick fight with her at the end thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job since the guy ends up looking like jerk and she is the poor defenceless female he of course goes along with it gee wonder if they get together in the end ve seen more original stuff on the wb and better stuff too picture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes and expecting us to like aniston character who comes off as cold spoiled bitch
louie is trumpeter swan with no voice in order to woo his lady love serina louie makes friends with young boy sammy who persuades teacher mrs hammerbottom carol burnett to allow louie to attend class louie learns to read and write and returns to his flock but is laughed at once again when no other swans can understand his message of love for serina to make matters worse louie father feels he lost his honor because of the trumpet he stole for his son in this animated version of white trumpet of the swan as jane austen and henry james have become popular sources for adult filmmakers over the past decade or so white is being returned to for children films the animated charlotte web has become minor classic since its release in 1973 and 1999 brought us live action version of stuart little trumpet of the swan directed by richard rich 1999 animated the king and the swan princess series is unlikely to be remembered along with those two trumpet of the swan is receiving regional theatrical release but is sure to quickly appear on home video boston is one of the targetted cities because our hero louie becomes famous playing his trumpet in beantown he encounters gypsy like con man in the public gardens who pitches louie and his trumpet as an added attraction to boston swan boats louie stays at the ritz carlton before giving concert at the hatch shell along the banks of the charles river at this point louie earned enough money so that dad can pay for the trumpet and become musically capable enough to win over serina father trumpet of the swan features flat background art some poor sound syncing and insipid sugary songs this effort would be better suited to saturday morning television than the big screen but may be ok for the real small set
one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles he has built strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish and one of his best was his last film lone star after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us mexico border expectation ran high for his next film unfortunately his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do then the film does exactly what it promised painful as that is the plot of men with guns can be summarized in central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas dr fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went and he found out again and again and again of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into living hell guerrilla war is always bad for civilians but the film talks down to the viewer dr fuentes played by federico luppi teaches medicine in the capital city of his country he has as great humanitarian gesture trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world little better for the poor indios fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs squalid private pharmacy in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others the student tells him the others are still in the mountains but suggests that it may not be good place to be fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors ignoring the advice of his family and patient who happens to be an army general the results are little different than one would expect dr fuentes starts out incredibly naive even some american tourists present in the film mostly for comic relief seem to know better than dr fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos damian delgado makes late appearance as an army deserter mandy patinkin has small role made to look bigger in the trailer
traffic violation dr daniel review of turn dr rating critical condition okay here the deal ll be the first one to grant that everybody needs day off now and then ll even go so far as to say that vacation is necessary part of doing any job well mean hey ve been known to stretch weekend into three day outing if friday looks to be slow day and if monday ain looking like pick me up well ve been known to give martha nell call and say do me favor sweetheart bump old man ferguson boil lancing to tuesday morning and tell miss audrey that ll swing by her house monday evening and see if we can get her trick knee back in line simple sentence like that and ve got nice four day fishing trip with the boys or more often than not trip up to cherokee for jackpot bingo and assorted other mountain funnery but the point is if you take day off do something different if you ve worked yourself silly for months relax bit sleep in eat pancakes at noon microwave an egg in its shell watch pro wrestling with the sound off listen to some barry beyaz records at high speed whatever but do not under any circumstances spend your vacation doing the same thing you do for living and if you do don make the final product look ten times worse than it would any other time because do not want to hear your sob stories oliver stone you apparently thought you needed break from making important films cool so you found this hinky little book and decided to make it movie that cool too but ollie old sage do not take good story and hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade just eager to meet you one day so can buy you stoli look you in the eye and say what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with turn and ll stand there staring til get straight answer sean penn stars turn as bobby drifter who had some troubles while back he heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows radiator hose stranding him in superior arizona held there by an ignorant inbred turtleneck hick of mechanic named darrell while darrell puts new hose on the ride bobby walks into town to see what cooking is it needless of me to say that superior arizona is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely probably not bobby meets up with grace jennifer lopez who invites him back to her place for drape hanging and other domestic issues just as those issues are starting up grace husband jake storms in looking like check out day of the elks lodge convention just beats bobby silly bobby takes to the road only to meet up with jake again and jake asks bobby to kill grace little while later grace asks bobby to kill jake them murderous arizonians gotta love em if any of this sounds familiar congratulations you win kewpie doll the story is straight shoplift of kirmizi rock west cult favorite few years back from john dahl maker of the phenomenal the last seduction but the contest doesn end there guys and gals we get steals from russ meyer movies where everybody in town is horny and sweaty we get the town from bad day at siyah rock minus the train plus busty women who can speak look at any schwarzenegger film and you ll see our hero bobby as bobby has mudhole stomped in his keister dozen times has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times gets bit by tarantula gets shot at and ends up with vultures circling overhead all the while getting up like he just got shaving nick bobby as terminator stretch it bit and we have five finger discount from doc hollywood where the whole story occurs because of car trouble forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic okay he working from book so maybe ollie not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas just expect man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft few original ideas before exposing the negative just wish he hadn brought cast like this together for what amounts to group toe stub sean penn gives great performance and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be playing over the top caricatures of stereotype characters the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blankety blank is going on too bad it not fun to watch when it happening to us while we sit through this mess of film turn is not bad film if you re fan of technique it the oliver stone you ve always known robert richardson is his usual cinematographer and rob and ollie know how to shoot flick great camera angles shifting viewpoints wicked colors nice looking pictures but pictures of what think rather stare at xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt whirl point of this loser film plot twists are one thing repetition is almost unforgivable and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie ve seen in the past five years oliver know your body of work is nothing to sniff at you ve been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie and films like platoon jfk wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on your scripts are certainly respectable your budgets are up there on the screen and your actors don dog it and know that maybe with turn you were just kicking back just having fun that fine but don do that with movie with the potential of this one do some police academy sequel imagine that do big comedy like remake of it mad mad mad mad world but do not drop limp turn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as an oliver stone movie and not question why it stinks like week old snook there right way to have fun and wrong way to have fun this was as wrong as you can get without going to jail
there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs one is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into feature film two is never greenlight sci fi film starring john travolta to wit we present the disaster that is battlefield earth science fiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum security prisons when prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior sci fi is always tricky beast tight script good director an ensemble cast of decent actors and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs battlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes here the `plot the year is 3000 mankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of race of aliens called the psychlos sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or beyaz rap group small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons who dwell in the cities below the psychlos are strip mining the earth for its resources and terel played by travolta is the head of security for the mining slave base located in denver young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler played with dramatic flair by barry pepper ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the `demons he is promptly captured and taken to the alien base after several attempts at escape johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terel involving circumventing altin from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end jonnie assumed leader of the mining slave group then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through learning machine terel forces him to use then the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry the bill of rights how to use machine gun and how to fly harrier jet the whole mess concludes with big loud obnoxious gun and plane battle that had me praying for the end credits roger christian the director of this lumbering beast must have rented dune blade runner planet of the apes independence day stargate beastmaster the airwolf episodes the `v miniseries the matrix and the omega man and decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth christian even shoots every scene in weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie and every scene in the movie ends with middle wipe really the psychlos reminded me of cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit travolta acting hasn been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect jonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like `you can have your freedom if you fight then there the script the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet would be difficult task to achieve why because terel provides all the necessary tools to incite revolt for no particular reason beside the fact that `humans are stupid terel may be right you know humans made this movie
would you believe in real life mean that if you were julia roberts that you be the ugly underdog to your sister the creepy catherine zeta jones let me tell you what reality is reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in golden chariot that reality america sweethearts is the opposite of reality train wreck that tries to sell julia as scruffy also ran presumably because she wears horn rimmed glasses and used to be overweight uh huh the plot follows two married mega movie stars gwen and eddie zeta jones and poor poor john cusack whose material gets worse every year on the eve of their new star vehicle release film called time over time the only problem gwen and eddie have gone through nasty separation and the press and public have not been forgiving think meg and dennis gosh and the director has vanished with the film holding the only print hostage veteran pr agent lee billy crystal is called upon to clean up the mess throwing press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie presumably distracting the stupid stupid film critics into forgetting they haven seen the movie at all note to sony any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab and did mention gwen sister kiki roberts is along for the ride and that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way oh billy you re scamp the script you ve co written with peter tolan what planet are you from and bedazzled need say more is roast of hollywood and celebrity sure but it not funny one yes crystal tells us hollywood is lying to our faces if you are surprised by this you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine it about to expire aside from scant few zingers yeah se or winces rules america sweethearts jokes aren funny its pace is choppy and the whole affair comes off as vanity project not for headlining star julia roberts but for billy crystal to deliver bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself didn time it the movie not that bad but it crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film bad move billy your jokes suck the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie gags and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene how this movie earned pg 13 rating is mystery to me julia overcame lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend wedding into winning film but not even that 90 tooth smile can save her here obviously aware of the ugliness before him director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria as lisping spaniard christopher walken the insane time over time director and alan arkin new age guru in fright wig to crack wise none of the stereotypes is successful except for walken azaria comes off as preening queen when he supposed to be macho as for roth in case you don know went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio revolution which produced this work he back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years it ll probably be another 11 before he back again could drone on about how america sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies but that would get old instead ll settle for discussing the movie worst sin that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable not just in its plot but in its sentiment every single character in this film with the arguable exception of kiki is simply hateful and putting them in romantic comedy is waste of bunch of villains when you leave the theater you ll ask yourself too why would want any of these jerks to be happy
movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good the bad and the despicable originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in 95 but wanted to re write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics we need to be warned about some truly awful films too this picture was so bad it inspired the description for my 10 rating see ratings chart below the only thing saving it from 10 rating is that being able to rent movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting porno so it does indeed have some plusses in fairness elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff and her ability to whine and irritate us even while nude was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone this character is not smart not interesting and deliberately far too annoying far too often like in 1998s bulworth when the movie was over didn care one little iota about the main character at least warren beatty tried to make statement with his dreary and overrated film though showgirls is too stupid to make statement some people claim that the story is based on the legendary all about eve of all things if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph mankiewicz was he be well he be good screenwriter instead this project may have sunk his career he wrote the ha ha script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed the same team who created good sex film in 1992 basic instinct struck out here with their occasional violence gratuitous rated sex scenes and numerous and quite unnecessary lesbian overtones the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as dancer after the supposed street smart young lady gets conned out of her suitcase by slack jawed yokel in the opening sequence she befriends tailor of the glamorous stage production at the stardust hotel nomi doesn take advantage of this contact to break into the big time of dirty dancing right away first she becomes lap dancer at scummy strip club she sells her hot little wares at the cheetah for short time turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience hey never said she wasn hot number maybe it that her body which gets her into the big time when the star of the stardust hotel crystal connors gina gershon stops into the strip club it certainly isn her brains or pleasant disposition crystal requests private lap dance for her boyfriend kyle maclachlan he also happens to be the pleasure seeking worm who runs the big show crystal gets nomi onto the stardust team and after an interminable amount of time nomi earns the role of crystal understudy the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she not whore that phrase we hear few different times and it completely ludicrous of course she is she sells her soul to make it big but in the end we re supposed to believe that she better person than that we re supposed to root for her no way she tramp and back stabber who deserved nothing least of all vindication in the ahem climax she is not good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is the sub plot with male dancer glenn plummer who claims to see talent in nomi is just gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked little bit more it sure ain character development plummer also appeared in speed in 94 in smaller yet better role this sub plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control kyle maclachlan must have been promised big pay day or his standards have dipped since appearing in mavi velvet that picture was weird but some critics claim it one of the best movies of the 80s now ol kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the 90s too his sleazy character is important to showgirls but we don learn anything about him he uses people to get what he wants but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie is he villain who cares ultimately this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit everyone must know by now about the soft core acts of copulation especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool what few reviewers take issue with is how mean spirited this movie is everyone either having sex exacting revenge or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge it just too hard to take especially for over two hours if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world why couldn verhoeven have also made point of highlighting the whispers grunts and other sounds during the dance numbers it hard to care about these people if we can even appreciate what they re capable of doing on stage berkley may have future in hollywood because she can dance and she has great body after all the world of porn is still an active dishonourable profession perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford oops they re bad actors too well at least they re not selfish and contemptable like good ol slutty nomi malone useless trivia ironically elizabeth berkley played virtuous and holier than thou jessie on the teeny bopper tv show saved by the bell before breaking onto the big screen
mr nice guy is the latest jackie chan film so you should know what to expect weak plot terrible dialogue very little acting ability but some jaw dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile however mr nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie best efforts and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever jackie chan plays who else jackie this time out he famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show not that it ever makes difference in the plot there are only two scenes of him cooking for the rest of the film somehow he mutates into jackie chan supercop it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege tv newswoman diana gabrielle fitzpatrick covertly tapes drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo richard norton and local gang of toughs the demons although she only has one camcorder somehow the result is full of close ups and multiple angles hmmm shades of broadcast news anyway the goons discover diana and will do anything to recover the tape here lies another crucial flaw in the story doesn anyone realize you can copy tape oh well no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense as luck would have it diana runs across jackie and wouldn you know it jackie accidentally ends up with the tape this leads to countless chase and or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie in move apparently designed to woo american and other english speaking audiences the film uses english as its primary language however that doesn mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie recent americanized releases strangely many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english and poorly too whether this is just very bad case of looping an effort to minimize accents or simple case of nostalgia it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie dubbed films the plot in mr nice guy is negligible merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie films it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread look if you have jackie chan playing chef why not use that to your advantage watching jackie doing his stuff in kitchen beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts the action is mixed bag here there really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie films it takes place in the arbitrary location of construction site apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan the action in the film is neither jackie best nor worst but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes the film gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting once or twice it may be useful to highlight spectacular stunt sequence but to slo mo jackie running either this is nod to the six million dollar man or pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down if you ve seen all of jackie films and are in need of another fix go ahead and see mr nice guy however if you re just in the mood for some good action you be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work such as supercop
note to screenwriters and self when you hit the big time and the studios come knocking for those scripts that are sitting in your bottom drawer tell em all to hit the road gilligan wrote the arbitrarily titled home fries ten years ago it was shelved until he found success as one of the took second look at gilligan comedy they read it again wearing rose tinted glasses drew stars as sally dim but sweet pregnant waitress at small town burger joint located somewhere in the southern united states the father of her child is dead the victim of severe heart attack brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons these flyboys scared him with their low flying helicopter dorian wilson and angus busey were getting even for his philandering ways on behalf of their anguished mother hara trouble is sally picked up some interference on her drive thru headset and angus worries she may have heard conversations that took place in the helicopter prior to the accidental killing so dorian goes undercover as burger flipper before you can say with cheese he falls for the mother to be too bad mom and angus have homicidal plans for sally does this sound like movie you want to see without doubt the best thing about home fries is barrymore at the risk of sounding sexist she never looked better than here as curly redhead with twinkling eyes she is winning in role that requires her to do absolutely nothing except look apple cheek cute and gawk at wilson her real life boyfriend but the plot and the situations are so off putting that nothing could save it this movie desperately wants to get mentioned in the same breath as the coen brothers but home fries brand of laboured hipness would be foreign to geniuses like ethan and joel it raising arizona without babies without charm without laughs without human characters and without intelligence worst of all it creepy what funny about threatening to gun down pregnant woman with machine gun unless the woman in question is spice girl take out the helicopters the quasi incestuous relationship between the mother and her sons it is absolutely illogical within the movie framework that dorian still lives with his mother and brother and the scenes of murder attempted and otherwise and what are you left with the story of single woman with child who works at fast food joint but dreams of becoming country singer that could turn out to be the most boring movie ever made but it be better than home fries
the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes with everything ranging from confidential to palmetto to the big lebowski has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran talented directors with this particular genre directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower class and the glamorous opulent upper class while maintaining the noirish ambiguous ambience the staple of film noir wild things could be classified as siyah comedy sultry film noir or plain ol erotic thriller but the one category it doesn qualify for is that of quality motion picture overacted overwrought and overlong wild things is confused mess movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too with its incalculable twists turns more twists and more turns it soon becomes tedious exercise in pointlessness in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal wild things not once jells in its eroticism unpredictability character motivation sense of the world plot etc there not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical directed by john mcnaughton henry portrait of serial killer wild things follows sam lombardo matt dillon hunkish suburban florida high school teacher who the dream of every spruced up female in the community particularly one kelly van ryan denise richards adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with partner soon her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take hike enabling her to come into his house next thing she cries rape and the so called roller coaster ride ensues second accuser comes front suzie toller neve campbell booze drinkin tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her virtually guaranteeing trial where preposterous confessions asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo zany lawyer he wears fake neck brace waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role as ridiculous as it sounds he the most sane character in the movie the community is astonished reporters flee to the scene there an million settlement for libel suit against kelly mother theresa russell there the ambiguous cop kevin bacon who also executive produced who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit murder and lust we the audience sniff something not so lustful like so many thrillers these days including the usual suspects and the game wild things eschews character for plot mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease as if he knows the territory he covering is harmless appetizer to accompany henry furious unsettling film directorial tour de force george clinton score is delight to behold but it the humans the characters are mere devices for the nasty twists what writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving almost unbearable if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting don feel real or we don care for them not even the unintentionally funny moments work the people in wild things are not so much people as they are caricatures then there the erotic content which nearly earned the film an nc 17 for sexless badly edited poorly lit menage trois and in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country kevin bacon member makes cameo appearance with ten minutes to go ironically the wildest elements of wild things are not wild at all
it rocks actually lots of rocks fly at us or from us in slow or fast motion at several points in the film they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward and when they land once in while when we need break from the space sequences they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like nary mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon steroid user answer to deep impact bruce willis stars as harry stamper famed oil driller commissioned by the beyaz house and nasa to stop giant asteroid before it travels beyond zero barrier and destroys our planet why an oil driller they require someone experience with deep core mining to plant nuclear missile into said asteroid in one unintentionally hilarious sequence nasa asks harry to inspect deep core driller they built based on his blueprints it is poorly constructed harry criticizes almost every aspect of it we trust nasa to build space shuttles harry assembles the obligatory ragtag bunch of cowboys including blond guy fat guy siyah guy wiseass and the man who is sleeping with his daughter affleck once they reach space we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong perhaps the fact that they sent bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes whether or not they save the day will not reveal nor will you care will say this you know you re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope willis has barely chance to come alive ditto for affleck their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act in last minute and futile attempt to inject warmth into the material steve buscemi character the wiseass is exceptionally problematic rockhound as he called is sarcastic and foolish so they tape him to chair where he spends most of the film so why did they bring him up there to begin with rather why write him into the film give his almost witty one liners to serious willis who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel at least in my world where the sky is mavi liv tyler is pretty and humourless as always suspiciously four of her father band aerosmith songs grace the soundtrack director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick like ketchup eventually drowning the movie on screen the middle hour is non sensical pyrotechnic assault on the average primate brain whenever someone dies in this movie crew member inevitably yells out we lost insert dead person last name here must admit that not once could distinguish dead oil guy cum astronaut from live one and close ups of the corpses faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance as their skin was often covered in fake blood armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla it looks nicer and has fewer plot holes within its equally ludicrous framework it has vivid soundmix but at almost two and half hours could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story the love story has been played up in the ads perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic fever bollocks the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in moon crawler remember little film called jaws in this film three independent minded men suddenly found themselves on fishing boat in pursuit of deadly shark they didn much like each other at first eventually they started to respect one another one of jaws great scenes involved the would be ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories this is the sort of male bonding foreign to bay or his producer jerry bruckheimer who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before action was called male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps cannot relate to bunch of men who don bare their souls who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and kind of chest beating bravery to this will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic nor brave nor smart even this team couldn build birdhouse and if get no respect for disliking movie with all the synthetic feeling of trailer trailer for movie written by team of body builders and greeting card authors ve never been prouder wimp my whole life
there 000 foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies which are getting more irwin allen esque with every release the early wave of this revival while just as cheesy and laughable at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes deep impact tries to disguise itself as human drama with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking the repeating cycle is as follows the president morgan freeman will go on tv and tell the country that there remote chance comet will strike the earth but that the nation crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem then we get to see the plan in action in some sequence utterly lacking suspense the mission will barely fail and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth and there remote chance it will strike but that the nation crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem it goes on and on throughout the movie but every time freeman goes on tv we know his plan is going to fail how do we know this because we ve seen the tv ads for deep impact ads that feature freeman telling the nation that the comet is still headed right for us and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading ladies and gentlemen that is the movie successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30 second tv spots television is what wrong with deep impact the main character played by tea leoni is low level broadcast journalist for msnbc and that the mere tip of the product placement iceberg who stumbles upon huge government conspiracy she thinks it an instance of an ex secretary of something or other james cromwell resigning because of mistress and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area when she goes nosing around cromwell he begs her to keep it under wraps know you re just reporter but you used to be human being she figures out what really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search where all good journalists learn the difference between mistress and an extinction level comet upon top secret meeting with president freeman leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold press conference at which she gets to ask the first question and everyone knows if you get to ask the first question baby you re star leoni ends up in the anchor chair broadcasting every step of the comet collision course with earth and sure it comforting for her to know that even though the world ending in matter of months she cable news personality so there she is narrating the six astronaut mission to blow the comet up such personalities as robert duvall jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged out process but as anyone who seen the commercials knows the astronauts fail they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces which means even more destruction to the earth yeah thanks nasa that when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years they even have animals two by two ready to climb into the cave if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed deep impact could have been far more interesting movie instead we watch as lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife while people pack the highways out of town the reasoning is of course that if comet is going to strike they might as well be out in some scenic rural location and amusingly the highway is spotted with people in haul trucks sure it comforting to know that even though the world ending in matter of minutes the haul people are doing the most business of their lives
there will be another the ads for this sequel proclaimed and why not true brandon lee is dead but there would be no reason for him to appear in followup to 1994 the crow anyway the idea of spinning artist james barr original comic book series into sequel franchise revolves around the notion that different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie taking its own righteous vengeance against the world given that basic framework the story could move in any number of directions of course it doesn stubbornly the crow city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film when lee eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death remember the first film primarily as harrowing exercise in brutality in flashback we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover and then we watch in real time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind it loud and repetitive true sadist delight but it also horrifying and fascinating city of angels gives us more of the same but less skillfully there an audience guaranteed for film like this although bad reviews and poor word of mouth will likely ensure that it won be much of success in fact miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings ve never understood the reasoning behind this tactic since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup this time ashe french accented actor vincent perez is retrieved from his watery death he and his young son were shackled together shot and then thrown off pier by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead perez might have some screen presence if he given something to do with himself but here he simply thrown in front of the camera as pretty face at first he shivery and frightened but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes badass biker from beyond the grave he befriended by sarah mia kirshner presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film kirshner so beguiling in exotica is here an exquisitely photographed blank tattooed with angels wings sarah is just about as lovely as women come but she serves no purpose not even as seductress the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah richard brooks but far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop who plays gaunt fellow named curve iggy all bones veins and drawl is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film like all good things here he dispatched too soon and without much imagination in the meantime we re subjected to tedious glimpses of judah compound where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren distinctly secondhand even the soundtrack is tired more than anything ve seen from hollywood lately city of angels smacks baldly of product it movie with lousy script but great look critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope but his work isn that bad per se he got good eye and some intriguing visual ideas if anything this movie has few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery his major stylistic failing is that he can seem to direct an action scene and the quick nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of low budget kung fu movie but as director he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn the performers who couldn and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved who bought david goyer anemic script anyway the producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be hollow rehash or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference
late in down to you the lead female character julia stiles states her greatest fear is having an artificial conversation with her boyfriend freddie prinze jr the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out fallen asleep or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy the film is multi million dollar testament to everything artificial filled with characters motivation plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster prinze plays college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles freshman co ed at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out doing the previous in how cute it can be the happy couple psychoanalyze each other they pick out song because as prinze dj mother lucie arnez explains every couple needs song he smells her shampoo she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love then in standard romantic comedy style things fall apart why well because they have to otherwise the couple can make up and live presumably happily ever after down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together or even knowing each other but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to goat the supporting characters are remarkably flat and insultingly ridiculous as well stiles best friend rosario dawson is pot head prinze roommate shawn hatosy is girl crazy fool who can meet women and then there are the porn stars zak orth and selma blair he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television does the college lecture circuit and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film you know the average porn star the costume epic idea gives him reason to appear in different ridiculous outfit everytime he on screen the porn angle exists just so there can be couple of stupid sex jokes she is porn star mostly so we know she slutty so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted attempts at drama which means julia is going to cry include pregnancy scare and the big break up these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes what happened here the cast is full of likable promising young actors stiles especially seems to be going places writer director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off in fact the whole film feels like reworking of last year extremely unpleasant the story of us for teen audiences the direction is film school grad obvious it stylish in hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen pointless parody of cops characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters and hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion plus the whole story is told flashback style narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera this is the second film in row following wing commander starring freddie prinze jr which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she all that if he doesn start making better choices fast his future films won be so lucky
it was with great anticipation that sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers james horner what was in for was disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 what drags braveheart down is its screenplay it abounds with high production values john toll award winning cinematography which also graced edward zwick 1994 legends of the fall gorgeous score by horner and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names but this does not save misguided script the film wishes to paint its central character as hero but the viewer only response to his heroism is intellectual william wallace producer director mel gibson is fighting for freedom and against tyranny so we have to root for him but wallace actions paint different story he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king wallace speaks of freedom but his acts point toward vengeance after kicking the english out of scotland he decides to invade england this is evident of spartacus complex and this example applies both historically and cinematically the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities the film spartacus like braveheart has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay it is shame that such an excellent score is part of such terrible film horner score tries to make emotional connection but the performances and the script do not help gibson portrays wallace in such way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him this drags down any emotional connection to the film plot and turns three hours into total waste of time
susan granger review of the watcher universal just what we need another lurid trashy serial killer saga this time keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in gruesome ticking clock cat and mouse game with james spader burnt out fbi agent who has suffered traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd to taunt spader who has relocated to chicago reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too before long he starts mailing photographs of the lonely unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims challenging spader along with the chicago police department to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again in the midst of this murderous frenzy there spader psychologist played by marisa tomei who is even less convincing as medical professional than jennifer lopez in the cell writers david elliot clay ayers and darcy meyers along with first time director joe charbanic helmer of music videos for reeves band dogstar dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase revealing early on exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop need each other to give meaning to our lives plus as reeves explains we re all stacked right on top of each other but we don notice each other any more after that it all sound effects and tricky camera work along with muddled discordant soundtrack james spader acting technique can be described as wooden deadpan while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone dude persona which sometimes works sometimes doesn chris ellis as spader self important colleague is the only cast member who manages to be convincing on the granger movie gauge of to 10 the watcher is an appallingly awful amateurish the real torture is watching it
ahh yes the teenage romance an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies and in the end the guy always gets the girl and with the arrival of the breakout hit `she all that last year followed by long catalogue of imitators including `10 things hate about you and `drive me crazy the genre previously on life support is once again hot commodity along now comes `down to you the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she all that craze with their latest project which has the studdly freddie prinze jr attached and all only `down to you doesn have the unlikely scenario mentioned above it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance dull unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we re accustomed to this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12 year old girls will find convincing in strictly textbook fashion college sophomore and aspiring chef al prinze jr meets freshman artist imogen julia stiles they hit it off like couple can only in the movies from here it the standard boy meets girl boy loses girl boy drinks entire bottle of shampoo and may or may not get girl back story the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters who are frequently taking part in activities that well only happen in the movies fortunately the cast of `down to you has certain appeal freddie prinze jr and julia stiles are an adorable couple and when on screen together they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around zak orth as the newly realized porn star monk shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film intelligent dialogue rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy `the faculty selma blair `cruel intentions and ashton kutcher tv `that 70 shows even the fonz himself henry winkler the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia has welcome role as al dad the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray maybe the concept of `down to you looked good on paper to draw such crowd as feature film however the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely perhaps worst of all `down to you is not funny the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired the characters on screen often laughing at each other goofy embarrassing antics seemed far more amused than the audience even the giggly 12 year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it course the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr in fantasy sequence called `cooks `cops take off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook decent meal for needy families with the assistance of fully armed swat team of course when this is the highlight reel you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired in order to make teen comedy work you ve got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity `10 things hate about you actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards and the result was refreshing no such luck with `down to you it just textbook romance where despite absurd circumstances everything is bound to work out in the end and at the end of the whole clich ordeal the nicest thing you could possibly say would be only in the movies
virus is the type of cliched vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it strangely enough on the same mid january weekend last year another film was released like this deep rising about an ugly monster on cruise liner prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989 leviathan 1989 deep star six and all four alien pictures virus in comparison is servicable thriller well made and produced but since it doesn include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on based on series of comic books virus concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat which becomes extremely damaged during violent typhoon after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking un lucky for them huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen once the team reaches the russian ship they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted after turning the power back on however there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself one survivor finally does turn up nadia joanna pacula who informs the suicidal and stern captain donald sutherland and one of the crew kit foster jamie lee curtis that mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out if virus sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies you re correct although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life the film itself doesn appear to have brain in its head the film sticks so close to the worn out conventions of the creature genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play in her second return to horror in the last year jamie lee curtis once again proves to be strong and resourceful heroine but that is about it although 1998 halloween h20 was also disappointment at least she was given few scenes to develop character unlike here donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films such as 1994 the puppet masters although just watched him in the superb 1978 sci fi classic invasion of the body snatchers where he was fabulous the last of the three top billers is william baldwin but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture since he has nothing to do basically virus is another one of those films where group of people walk around and investigate space ship ocean liner haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one by one it is not the worst of its type but it is far from one of the best and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this as long as some of them keep making money suspect the answer is never
over 40 years ago japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind nuclear testing partly flight of fancy partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo year later gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things new name dubbed english track and raymond burr as godzilla the film took on the rest of the world thirty years later toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things yes including raymond burr and called it godzilla 1985 now it 14 years after toho remake and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run in emmerich godzilla matthew broderick plays dr niko tatopoulos biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of radiation induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states meanwhile tatopoulos college girlfriend audrey timmonds maria pitillo works in new york city as an assistant to big time news reporter she like to be reporter herself and when godzilla comes ashore she figures this is her big break of course with the big guy running amok in the city niko and audrey are bound to cross paths and are joined by victor animal palotti hank azaria audrey trusty cameraman friend and phillipe roche jean reno an operative for the french government whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation premiere movie production companies one would think emmerich could make film truly deserving of the name godzilla he didn right up there with the lost world godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history the plot is pretty much what we expect the big dinosaur like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city and it up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down the script however is painfully bad it fraught with lines so corny they don even belong in movies and includes many character actions which make you think you idiot or you stupid girl suppose when you ve got movie with giant lizard loose in new york any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them but is conveniently able to leap atop others why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him when they could more easily keep track of him by flying little higher and in straight line why do sidewinder missiles which have small explosive warheads blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla why is mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three 18 fighter bombers when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two okay maybe the last one was bit nit picky but hey was on roll broderick is usually good actor but in this film he weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way hank azaria does what he can but don expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage like broderick azaria character is quite simply lacking in color what really annoyed me was maria pitillo who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting casting must have been asleep on this one the one bright spot here is jean reno who oddly enough seems to fit well into role which is often comedic quite unlike what we ve seem him do in the past although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster reno brings style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable unfortunately the same cannot be said of the other incongruities the entire feel of the movie is tongue in cheek and seems to pay comical homage to dozen or so films that have come before it this results in significant amount of parody which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster and ends up just producing mess most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously although emmerich obviously wanted to make fun action picture what good is it to sink millions into cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens if we can take the characters seriously the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don care what happens to them godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be film more light hearted than it should be far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters but here behemoth running through the city there bound to be lot of casualties but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after school joe cartoon syndrome where almost everyone seems to get out of harm way just in time in couple of scenes godzilla briefly breathes fire none of the characters even remark upon this ability nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers it as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes godzilla can do this just like in the old movie consider another punch pulled through creative script writing you can make sequel out of just about any movie but the final scene in this one doesn just leave the door open it opens into hallway leading directly into room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently it made me want to gag emmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in jokes and played this one as straight action film with an intelligently written screenplay godzilla could have been so much more however by confusing the viewer with ton of add ins and parodies the movie ends up being something that just doesn work now if they only had raymond burr
before the remake of psycho appears we ve got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film dial for murder as usual hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars and it all amounts to loud sounding nothing the film opens with emily paltrow and david viggo mortensen having fun in an loft apartment the problem is paltrow is married to stephen douglas who is not too happy when he discovers this affair if was paltrow though definitely go with mortensen less wrinkles anyhow stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition he ll pay him to kill his lovely wife mortensen agrees but the murder goes awry and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses unfortunately the film dosen progress very fast in fact it moves like tortoise with arthritis read very very the plot moves nowhere fast and only becomes exciting in very short bursts not too good for thriller also the performances apart from douglas are below par paltrow showing immense talent in se7en 1995 and sliding doors 1997 is strangely stilted even unconvincing in this movie mortensen is little bit better coming across as younger douglas but his role isn meaty enough to show all his talent which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film which is does however doubt douglas finds it very hard to play stogie smoking drinking womanizer with creepy underside also popping up in the film is david suchet playing shifty looking detective again it not character we re seeing on the screen it david suchet the director who bought us the fugitive piles on all the flash techniques such as zoom in quick cuts etc the lighting is also interesting however looks can save this film from the depths of mediocre and the film seemed to work better in single set anyway the screenplay is but there some hackneyed sub plot about douglas being ruthless player on wall street again and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched the characters also make incredibly dumb moves especially paltrow and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel with combination of no tension drama or decent characters perfect murder is failure all round and an incredible disappointment there are few bright moments but they are far and few between the last thing thriller should be is boring and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas you wouldn be missing anything if you decided not to watch perfect murder overall rating= review by david wilcock 1998 you know for kids norville barnes
coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers relentless 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz played by character actor leo rossi spawned three more sequels relentless third in the row features sam dietz again but this time detective who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case doesn want to deal with similar line of work divorced demoralised and transferred he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes hunting ground for another serial killer and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz old cases to make things even more interesting it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation fans of the british tv films and mini series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see lot of similarities relentless series of movies they both feature vicious psychopathic killers yet also give lot of usually depressive details about chief investigator private lives this one isn an exception but similarities with british television are only in content the execution and style is different which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best useless gratuitous erotica also doesn help either obviously making this film longer than it should be the actors are good though leo rossi is fine as usual and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career signy coleman as dietz love interest is on the other hand quite miscast but she won have to worry about it in the future career since relentless wasn supposed to be anybody finest moment anyway
edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back and like his previous two it is working class relationship picture however unlike his previous work the film dwells on more personal story and with female protagonist and in no looking back he stumbles making slow boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work claudia lauren holly is small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life she at turning point in her life and feels as if she going nowhere her boyfriend michael jon bon jovi is broke and in dead end job if she were to marry him she never get chance to escape this town enter charlie edward burns claudia old flame he skipped town several years before without any explanations even for claudia he has come back to town to see her and suddenly she is torn should she stay with stable michael and never escape her hometown or should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again part of the answer lies in the character of her mother blythe danner who fell for the wrong man and has spent her life pining for claudia father to return now it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes at only little past ninety minutes no looking back is rather short for its genre unfortunately it seems much much longer the storyline is simple and uninspired and there lack of energy to the whole proceedings which makes the entire drama rather tedious edward burns makes misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame there no one to restrain his ego which reigns unchecked he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons yeah right lauren holly does what she can with her central character but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions and we never really care bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie his acting talents are much greater than they might seem but he is given mostly bland and ineffective role to work with there not much to recommend in no looking back it not that the film is bad it simply boring there no zest in any aspect of the film and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it
don expect much from eddie murphy these days for the past four years the gods of cinema or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates have allowed him to make one bad movie after another such films as metro doctor dolittle holy man life and bowfinger have reduced once great comedic persona to living and breathing washed up hack performing as studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film nutty professor ii the klumps the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places sherman has just invented new youth drink that enables man or beast to become younger for short period of time janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for soul mate rather than excel at her career as university professor and for the most ridiculous reasons with love on his mind sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego buddy love from the first professor who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers with some convoluted mumbo jumbo about dna extraction sherman extracts the buddy love link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into handy dandy lab beaker but one night the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy then the klump family all played by eddie murphy step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex flabby breasts slew of fart and dick jokes and enough fat people jokes that lost count after the first thirty minutes and did mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster the movie finally dissolves into really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene pure and simple the klumps is failure its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process it more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade american pie have their names stamped to this trash hey guys quick note keep this movie off of your resumes the characterization of sherman family the klumps is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of siyah family have ever seen in cinema everyone member of the family is large person who wipes the bins clean at local buffet restaurant like pigs at trough the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts the father is gruff is fired from blue collar job is sexually inadequate and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct and you got the feeling that these crass people couldn act like this all the time the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic after while their conversations just become barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story its also damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such lame story line even the best effects can seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days now that think about it the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make people will be lined up around the block for it the studios will concoct the sequel for release in the summer of 2002 eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles but he ll play every character in the movie just can wait to see eddie murphy in love scene with himself
brian de palma the director who bought us carrie dressed to kill and mission impossible is back and has bought all his technical expertise with him sadly he forget to bring good story and believable characters nic cage plays rick santaro fast talking cop who is watching boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne sinise an assassination takes place and santaro tries to peace together how it took place trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy the film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together however the film doesn keep the mystery for long and once the big secret is out concerning kevin dunne the film is at dead end although there are some fantastic shots by de palma including 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film halfway through the film drops dead the problem is that de palma doesn have strong story or characters to work with he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience and quickly got bored nic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters but it no use they are boring faceless and completely unlikeable yes another problem with the film is that there no one to root for we re supposed to be on cage side because his character becomes nicer throughout the film however his change is sadly unbelievable poor gary sinise character is terrible who completely changes throughout the start the middle and the end in an appalling way the film use of flashback quickly gets boring while clever and interesting the first few times it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go they certainly don increase the tension or suspense of the movie there is small thread of suspense running through the film but it certainly doesn make this film powerhouse thriller rather just slightly below average one the script is lousy and contrived the characters flat and two dimensional certainly not good factors for film passing itself off for thriller the most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential there good story buried in snake eyes it just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks it also gives itself away far too quickly rather than leaving the big twist for the end while the performances are intriguing especially by newcomer carla gugino as sexy number cruncher wrapped up in the case there no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is terminal case of style of substance and unless you re big fan of either cage or flash directing should be avoided david wilcock review 1998 you know for kids norville barnes

lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode episode is boring empty spectacle that features some nice special effects after the familiar long time ago opening the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo ruled by queen amidala portman jedi knights qui gon neeson and obi wan mcgregor are sent to negotiate deal with the confederation to stop the blockade however this simple blockade is not all it seems and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers including facing the evil darth maul ray park they also meet the future darth vadar anakin skywalker jake lloyd star wars is largely failure in all the major areas of filmmaking script direction and characters the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into two hour epic the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non existent there no underlying tension and no urgent need to see what the outcome is the film also takes leisurely pace in telling the boring story which doesn help there no snap to make the film work it moves at plod the script is boring all the characters speak in morals especially anakins mother there no group spirit evident here and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders it evident that not much is going to happen the two leads are hideously boring static characters given little to do and too much time to do it qui gon and obi wan hold no presence on film and give little for the audience to root for the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul if he had been given more screen time maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history even if he does provide the only straight plot line in the film all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy anakin is annoying and unlikeable instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended it probably not surprising that his hateful little boy unfortunately blessed ani by everyone he knows joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks although in the end none is provided in the film by him although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by pod racer because knew he wouldn be able to talk for while queen amidala is nothing in the film she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must serve her people and go goo goo over anakin again her role will become more important in the later episodes and is given little to do here the actors don help the movie much either liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible mcgregor comes across as posh mothers boy with little charm the casting director must have chose him because he scottish like alec guinness there little other explanation for it natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and poor script but she delivers spunky performance and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in bored voice there very little talent evident with him it hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there he not even very cute the main claim of the film the special effects are okay there nothing impressive about them yet they complement the story well the cgi takes away much of the human element however the battle droids for example the replacement for the stormtroopers are characterless little computer graphics lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers episode is just disappointing it got high production values but little else the music is meandering except near the end the plot gives us no one to root for or even care for the effects are nice but dull the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should there an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair and many clich are catered for throughout the film apart from remotely exciting pod race sequence episode is dry affair that serves little purpose except to make money and to get us to watch episode to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film disappointing is barely the word rating=
five girls spend day in closed building doing inventory when strange box gets delivered there is this starting to sound familiar by mistake the girls accidentlly open the box big surprise huh and release an evil spirit of killer that kills the girls off one by one betcha didn see that one coming hard to die found out while watching the film is sequel to sorority house massacre nightie nightmare 1521 two of the actresses from sorority house massacre are in this film robyn harris and melissa moore but they play different characters here orville ketchum is also back as get ready for this orville ketchum yes the same character from number two yes he is also built like tank in this film too telling you nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn harm him at all the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that thought could act well they seemed to have lost that ability thankfully for my sanity also saw the film warlock which undid all the ill effects that got from this film the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out analyzed and discarded before it happens there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot while we are on the subject of the story the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress the film goes to the extent of putting shower in the manager office sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary ridiculous and hurts the story more if that is still possible the script for this film is completely pathetic the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible the only thing that think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along here is an example of the wonderful dialog the scene is two girls have just entered gun store and have picked out really big gun the line is my dad used to be marine bet can work it this line has got to be contender for the bad line hall of infamy now we fast forward for few minutes until just after big plan has been presented one comment from an actress is not lot of strategy involved but like it afraid folks that this is about as good as they get now lets talk about the great special effects for this film this obviously wasn big concern of the film makers the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer intelligence girl gets hacked with knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get the continuity department was obviously asleep along with the viewers when watching this film in one shot actress has cloths on camera angle changes actress seems to have lost clothing very impressive trick the one half plus that this film has going for it is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny and so the viewer can get some enjoyment from the film however this doesn make it worth the rental fee of over penny in the acting department the only thing can say is two thumbs squared and one head down would normally do detailed paragraph on this topic but there is no point here because there is nobody that was impressed with in the least oh well win some lose some
the first film produced by adam sandler happy madison production company clever title eh is essentially one joke movie much like the movies sandler stars in himself however the difference here is that this one joke just isn very funny rob schneider stars as the title character scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming man whore to raise enough money to replace wealthy client custom made fish tank which deuce destroyed while staying in his home deuce goes on numerous dates and each woman he goes out with has humorous quirk about herself one has narcolepsy one has tourette syndrome one is man etc etc my problem is that we see all of these women in the film trailer so why do need to watch the movie seen the trailer seen the film only quick cameo from norm macdonald and follow up joke during the closing credits generates any chuckles deuce bigalow male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video division of di$ney the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 85 and features the original theatrical trailer as well as trailers for mystery alaska happy texas and outside providence an extremely brief production featurette which contains footage not used in the film and storyboard to scene comparisons yep you read that right there are storyboard comparisons on this dvd two scenes are storyboarded neither of which are particularly exciting there are fight scenes in this movie so why aren we seeing storyboards of those segments especially the parody moments from the matrix wonder what funnier the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that di$ney thought fans of this film would want to see them deleted scenes sure audio commentary you betcha but storyboards come on [r]
tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie the film which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states is based on 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage and while it evident that this could be fascinating live production the translation to the screen is creative disaster enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through filmed version of performance art lifeless and tedious the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium tectonic plates has storyline although the narrative is developed in decidedly non traditional fashion with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences it not an inherently uninteresting way to present movie despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious all but screaming look art although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters because we re constantly made aware that we re watching play or movie it impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer ideas they re not real sympathetic or believable willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different but this particular experiment is not success tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine marie gignac an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor jacques lapage one day he disappears and fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love madeleine travels to venice to kill herself while preparing to commit suicide she encounters drug addict constance celine bonnier who causes madeleine to re think her decision meanwhile jacques has moved to new york city where he starts cross dressing calls himself jennifer and becomes successful counter culture talkshow host with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland supporting characters that include topless goddess and deaf mute and cultural references that point to chopin george sand and jim morrison tectonic plates is unique if nothing else however as interesting as the film sounds and was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising it never really delivers the tone is soporific the supposedly intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting the plot meanders in pointless and irritating manner although it doesn take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant and the symbolism is obvious tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth but it takes one hundred minutes to get across this transparent point there are some worthwhile moments such as silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren bilingual the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because it different it not like anything they ve seen before and it pretentious for everyone else it not only waste of time but poor introduction to the work of robert lapage
various films seen at the seattle film festival it all true three men on raft 1942 1986 director orson welles recently uncovered one fourth of orson welle planned docu drama of amazing stories around the world named it all true this short dealt with welle attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on raft while several clips of the film are seen the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle attempts to film it despite studio problems staggering workload and extremely ill fortune on the set impressive photography but really only interesting to film historians sadie thompson 1928 director raoul walsh screenwriter raoul walsh from the john colton play rain based on somerset maugham story miss thompson cast gloria swanson raoul walsh lionel barrymore silent after the discussion of the newly restored version of frank capra lost horizon where several scenes had been restored using stills was interested to see sadie thompson where the last minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story miss thompson this is one of the most skillful silent films have ever seen little awkwardness and very clever script the actors gloria swanson raoul walsh who also directed and wrote the screenplay and especially lionel barrymore as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie soul but really wants to get her between the sheets is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel swanson adds real life to the character adding an worldly affectionate air to the bawdy sadie unfortunately the ending is rather poorly tied up it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live action film or the original script the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on cannot believe maugham short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia the stills are expected to fill in conclusion we ve been waiting an hour and half for still it entertaining right up to the end certainly barrymore incredibly hammy performance which nonetheless works perhaps due to the silent screen is must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells bakkers and robertses of the religious worlds movie worth 50 if you can find it the pied piper czechoslovakia 1986 director jim barta screenwriter kamil piza this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with twist ending find highly appropriate and with lot of political comment along with it perhaps economic content is better word it certainly doesn show capitalism in good light nor human nature nor anything else for that matter as you may have guessed this is not tgif film this is the kind of film you are glad is over not that it wasn interesting for technical reasons this is stop animation that is very well done all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts except for the animated stuffed rats boy sounds like real comedy vehicle doesn it add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison and you have something to give the wee ones and some of the mentally unstable larger folk to keep them up at night some gore don bring children to this one don bring adults to this one unless they re fascinated by puppetry and or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped blech no fun whatsoever meier west germany 1986 director screenwriter peter timm cast rainier grenkowitz nadja engelbrecht alexander hauff thomas besvater sub titled this film takes us back and forth over the east german west german border with meier an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him good deal of money his uncle also in the west sneaks meier out of the country unknown to the east germans meier however is less than thrilled his girlfriend his friends and his job which he likes all exist in east germany after round the world trip his boss think he on leave in bulgaria meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with fake id and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew work while everyone think he still living in east germany of course something goes wrong and the ending is very funny but it takes the film too long to get there the humor is spread too thin and much of the plot is too obvious as is the acting still good concept for the comedy and the last five minutes are pretty funny $2 50 the right hand man australia 1986 director di drew screenplay helen hodgman cast rupert everett hugo weaving arthur dignam jennifer claire catherine mcclements after lifetime of movie going and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival ve learned several rules which while not absolute should certainly be given deference to be wary of french comedies these people like jerry lewis ken russell is never going to grow up no matter how long you wait any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as old pouty lips is probably not worth watching when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography watch out australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo but since weir and miller left for foreign shores finding good script or director seems to be difficult not impossible witness malcolm last year task well ignored rules last night and sat through film that should be in the golden turkey awards it as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30 about tragedy among the gentry and falling in love with people below your station and horses lots and lots of horses the film opens with stallion mounting mare under the direction of her ladyship which guess is some kind of foreshadowing because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir unfortunately said son reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times kills his father and loses an arm during racing accident highlights include the amputation sequence the doctor daughter who has the hots for the son tasting his urine for diagnosis their tender kissing with window between them while it raining you think woman studying medicine would know better the photography is good but kept wishing for b&w everything seems sepia colored anyway actually wished was watching swimming to cambodia instead but that life grade avoid like the plague unless you re looking for inadvertent yuks
from the director of the nightmare before christmas it said in the previews which guessing was said to get people to go see the movie obviously it hasn worked since the $75 million dollar movie has yet to break $5 million to each it own however since monkey bone is not only bad movie all together but technically well made tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects stu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena monkey bone crude comic strip that everyone wants to merchandise they go to great links to get it as well including dollars that let out fart powder when stu and his girlfriend julie bridget fonda are in freak car accident you ll see stu goes into coma and while in his coma stu travels to guessing dark town where all the characters in dreams come to life people are stuck in this town with their nightmares roaming around them when stu spots monkey bone whom he really can stand he tries to keep him under control making new friend kitty rose mcgowan he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death he can go back up and live his life when monkey bone and stu steal pass monkey bone becomes trader and takes it and goes into stu body now monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder so everyone has nightmares or something like that rather complex in fact more than it needs to be monkey bone had potential in the script and even the story what is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes and lack of character development for instance we really don get to know who stu or julie are so why should we even care kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha story behind her but we are not given chance to know her the cast is decent however brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body bridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to screeching halt her performance is bad and she seems miscast dave foley isn given enough to do as well as will grace megan mullally who can be funny the standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being total bust the special effects of monkey bone is what might really bring in some curious viewers these special effects are highly effective and nice to look at with the eyes some of them are believable and some unbelievable for monkey bone he seems to be like stuart little you really don realize that he is animated but on occasion it sneaks up on you the direction by henry selick is good but at times he doesn know what kind of film he wants to make and the ending climax falls off the cliff it too bad really monkey bone could have been real good movie but with it heavily done hack job and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role for those curious however it might be worth the rental but other than that avoid this one
numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci fi suspense thrillers soldier is multi crossbreed between the likes of terminator aliens and offspring the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is real mongrel not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground besides this the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured slow and sluggish and could have done with better choreography russell who is usually good actor in grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character sergeant todd who seems more like sergeant toad besides having almost no dialogue his character appears stunted zombie like which is in line with his screen persona but scores little points of empathy with the audience this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former it is still long way from anything considered desirable
documentary from the twin hughes brothers allen and albert dead presidents menace ii society about street pimps all of whom are african american an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be is what you get learned that the word bitch is their favorite word as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used it makes for film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say but if one has sense humor for what their lifestyle is about then some of what they rap about might seem amusing they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money it also power trip accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place this sleazy pic soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears these verbose pimps had smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models the feather hatted fur coated diamond ring wearing altin chain wearing flashy cadillac cruising pimp of the late 70s blaxploitation movies like the mack and willie dynamite also used as reference was iceberg slim best seller pimp the story of my life we meet pimps such as fillmore slim note charm red gorgeous dre bishop don magic juan and rosebudd they readily discuss their business arrangements including percentages lifestyles knockin stealing another pimp ho and the thrill they get from women giving them money these dudes needed no prompting to talk as they just love to brag about about themselves priests need nuns yaps note san francisco pimp doctors need nurses so ho need pimps as he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make that the girls need them to show them the ropes how to make money to be their security blankets protectors and counselors the race issue was brought up right from the film onset as number of beyaz interviewees regular citizens note that their impression of pimp is that he the lowest form of human while we are told in the siyah community the pimp is looked upon as successful entrepenaur riding around in fancy cars flashing wads of money dressed in flamboyant style where his snake gaiter shoes might cost him grand and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community we also see that the siyah pimps have number of beyaz girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery of master and slave relations the film was all about pimp style and their projected image as they run hard sell riff about the virtues of their work there are different styles of pimping but the film mentions them only as being macks and players or real pimps and perpetrator pimps but no further clarity is attempted it is also failed to get the women side to this story of abuse primarily taking the pimp at his word the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such perverted way as he does as the filmmakers were taking for ride by the pimps who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing hungry for their 15 minutes of fame the only laughs got out of this bleak look at an american subculture was hearing how few pimps retired and what they are now up to danny brown became blues singer so he could keep his pimp wardrobe while hollywood pimp called rosebudd married his ho and turned square working to support his wife and daughter as telemarketer

much ado about nothing ah how sweet the irony it accepted wisdom in some circles among english literature nuts mainly that whenever critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance he just doesn understand shakespeare you will hear them say the bard work is apparently beyond criticism what load of old cobblers if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh film of shakespeare comedy much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word it time to get life get monty python get woody allen get john waters whatever just get real taste of some clever witty risky comedy and banish this nonsense to where it belongs drama and tragedy was shakespeare strength to my sensibilities and no stick in the mud much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever no kidding this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours have ever spent in cinema in my 20 years of movie going the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend as this was our day out and hadn seen her in ages but boy does she owe me one won spend too much time on the plot basically we follow the trials and tribulations of two would be couples one young the other older there some dark treachery amongst all this but everyone is so awfully jolly that you hardly know it mind you there nothing wrong with the basic story good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound nothing wrong with most of the cast either branaugh emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers the problem is the script or more accurately shakespeare original text light comedy shouldn be complex yet wrapped in elizabethan english the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend for this alone it will be problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than good undemanding laugh the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves the actor once again miscast as jealous half brother or something but when dissected and understood what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold ho ho ho boy likes girl ho ho ho men are such klutzes ho ho ho she so awfully clumsy oh please there wit in here somewhere told call it pretentious something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay in the end it cringeworthy watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing very weird movie going experience comedy bah humbug
another formula feel good quirky comedy from the british isles much like waking ned devine and host of other popular low budget movies that turned nifty profit off thin story line it is filled with likable establishment types living in quaint town such as tolerant vicars and policemen plenty of eccentrics and of locals who stick together through thick and thin the strength of this film lies in its rational theme that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol the film is tolerable until after its first hour it then falls completely apart becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to at least be viewed as containing pertinent message its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the war on drugs is about to be escalated into colombia the drug war has been total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future it has so far just ended up causing america jails to be overcrowded with non violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america drug usage and drug supply billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war by backing corrupt government remember vietnam with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam with this scenario closer to home so what probably awaits such an effort is more futile result than the other war the film mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago is theme long overdue for public acceptance but one that is better received late than never there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this rather than making it police matter altogether the film opens in quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of middle aged woman grace brenda blethyn who fell out of an airplane evidently committing suicide the widow soon finds out her husband was bigger bastard than she imagined he left her with stack of enormous bills and put up without her knowledge their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for failed business venture by taking out second mortgage the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless she also knows that he was having an affair with sophisticated woman from london honey quick what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying is that when conferring with honey she finds out that he was tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can the creditors swoop down on her like vultures her gardener and handyman matthew ferguson decides to stay on with her despite his last check bouncing since she is an expert amateur horticulturist he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants which he grows for private use the two soon see this as possibly big business opportunity as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high quality stuff for grace this is way to save her house and get her out of debt for the scotsman matthew it offers chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky valerie the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed the police sergeant campbell pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace greenhouse is for the friendly vicar phillips counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can control and the doctor clunes enjoys smoking the weed for recreation the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with big time drug dealer instead of having matthew go because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn want matthew to end up in jail it is interesting to note that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you only that one can go to jail the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london trying to find drug dealer while dressed out of place in beyaz dress and hat one would wear to tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make drug deal was completely hokey and the film descended into huge siyah hole whereby it never recovered its dignity the film moves into the formula mode whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive as she meets an international drug dealer frenchman tcheky karyo who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes millionaire and writes best selling fiction book about her experiences thereby becoming celebrity things work out in ridiculous way where there is total breakdown in the character development of grace where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood there are lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded this unhip film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly but should be tolerated as something naughty middle aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute ummm
whether you like the beatles or not nobody wants to see the bee gee take on some of the fab four best known songs well maybe that not true maybe you re curious the way you have to look in your hanky after you blow your nose you just have to know how bad bad can be if that the case rejoice because it was twenty years ago today or so that sgt pepper lonely hearts club band was released unleashed to the world and thanks to our modern technological advances you can find this retched piece of filmmaking on vhs derived from the lyrics of various beatles songs sgt pepper tells the story of the fictitious band made popular from the song and album of the same name released in 1967 of course the movie was made eleven years later the gibbs three have become the lonely hearts peter frampton is the one and only billy shears and aside from being about rock band the story doesn correlate to the song at all and oh what joy we re the lovely audience they like to take home with them don think so but at least these characters are actually people in beatles song whereas other characters such as strawberry fields sandy farina gets her name from song about place called strawberry fields the debate over this is really quite futile when it comes down to it because all the film really has to offer is feast of horrid cover tunes embarrassing cameo appearances george burns steve martin alice cooper and uuuuuuggggggglllllllyyyyy 70 fashion and faces check please the plot is bit unclear people with bad 70 hair run around in leisure suits engaging in music video sequences that look like sick and twisted world of make believe from an overly demented mr rogers mean mr mustard frankie howerd somehow gets hold of all billy co instruments calling dr maxwell edison steve martin with silver hammer and an out of key singing voice the sun king marvin sunk alice cooper and couple of creepy robots to his aid supposedly this is horrible thing guess in heartland the talent is pretty non existent meanwhile the lonely hearts are off doing the classic sex drugs and rock roll thing leaving poor strawberry fields without her true love billy she sets out to find him leaving her poor dad and mom mrs fields hey wanna cookie all alone to sing horrible rendition of she leaving home accompanied by those same creepy robots but is billy getting it on with lucy dianne steinberg ya know the diamond possessing girl who hangs out in the sky well there some crazy chick singing soprano on the roof of building next to bus stop and assume that who it was it movies like this that make ya sit back and ask the unanswerable question what the hell were they thinking nobody will ever know but as novelty sgt pepper is one to examine carol channing robert palmer keith carradine they re all here but why who knows it irrelevant there as much meaning to be found here as there is to be found in your belly button lint although the latter may be more interesting with the recent onslaught of 70 nostalgia in the movie world the ice storm boogie nights reissues of the star wars trilogy etc let pray this doesn get special 20th anniversary second chance in theaters in the words of paul mccartney live and let die in fact bury this one while you still can
warning spoilers are included in this review but it doesn really make much of difference deep impact begins the official summer movie season and it also brings back memories of 1997 remember when dante peak came out in february few months later volcano was released the first film was smart exhilirating and one of the best disaster films had ever seen the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent well it deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition this time unfortunately the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon the upcoming comet disaster to be released the beginning of july of course the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine and so am in the minority as was when stood on the side of dante peak but while watching deep impact began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film apparently many did and it utterly baffles me to be completely honest haven had this little fun watching disaster film in my entire life volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo but it was still rather fun to watch deep impact doesn just have implausibilities it also contains cheap human drama incredibly horrible special effects and poorly constructed plot the only thing that gives it half star above my bottom ranking is slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters deep impact begins in an unnamed year the year varies advanced technology sets it in the future but fire in the sky is showing on local movie theater pushing it back to 1993 line of students is outside at night peering through telescopes at the dark sky above among these are leo biederman elijah wood and sarah hotchner leelee sobieski leo unknowingly discovers comet and his teacher sends photo of the unknown object to an astronomer who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about few seconds he races off to mail the information but is killed in reckless car accident year passes and nothing is heard about it again we are then introduced to jenny lerner leoni reporter for msnbc she gets handed job to investigate possible cover up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse james cromwell she talks to woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with girl named ellie after talking with rittenhouse and unsatisfied with the information she gets she decides to use the internet for help luckily she knows exactly how to spell the certain ellie that she is looking for they spell it ele in the film that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled before she can use the information the government decides to push her car off the road they take her in to meet the president of the united states president beck morgan freeman beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold press conference naturally she wants to be compensated and they offer her front row seat and the chance for the first question and so yada yada yada they reveal the comet to the public and their plans send massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive they announce plan called ark which is their only hope for survival computer will select 800 000 people at random these people are the ones who will go into large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won kill off the entire human race after two years the dust will settle actually it would take much much longer approximately ninety years from what understand and the humans could come back to the surface and start over the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures but there is one subplot worth mentioning jenny and her father jason maximilian schell have very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional it shame that nothing else is heartfelt now of course we all know that the comet does impact the surface the title alone suggests it and the previews actually show it by doing this absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won work director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show er her major film debut was the peacemaker pathetic and heartless action film well this time leder outdid herself creating film worse than that one suggestion to ms leder please stay away from the big screen or at least the action genre much of the blame can be placed on leder directly because the pace is disastrously off throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed it goes from months to weeks to hours it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real time it that boring of course leder isn all to blame for it screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted simplistic story that only gets worse with time what starts out promising soon turns deadly for the audience anyway chock full of cheesy one liners you know you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school and stupid characters you might think we were back in the 70s again only one of the subplots is remotely interesting while the rest are forgettable and boring and the main plot is so outrageous that you can figure out if this film is supposed to be an action drama or sci fi to put it simply the special effects of this film are hit and miss situation that right 80% miss and 20% hit scenes above the earth are well done and the orbiting ship is majestic but the comet is huge mistake making it more laughable than frightening the concept of even trying to land on comet is preposterous enough but that forgiveable what isn forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface give me break will ya and of course the much hyped collision of comet and earth well it is far from spectacular and it makes independence day look brilliant the water rushing towards the land is effective but once it hits the continent the effects turn ridiculous cgi water is used and it looks so bad that heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks in fact may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days just when we think visual effects can be improved along comes film to show that they really can and should be one thing has struck wrong note with me concerning mimi leder direction which also influences the actors leder loves to show the actors faces before and during moments of terror this reminded me of another action director renny harlin die hard cliffhanger but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations leder likes to flaunt people fears via their faces but instead of coming off as sympathetic leder seems more of sadist one moment has an astronaut flying off into space this should be enough to warrant response from the audience but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person face while drifting into space this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience and for one am not going to be fooled on another note leder film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts the pace does pick up and some very emotional moments are shown then again when you watch people cry for their loved ones it obvious it will be emotional it mostly just big trick to rope viewers into feeling for the characters but it didn work for me but anyway the actors do as much as they can with what they are given leoni bad boys tv the naked truth is the best of the film and she is given the meatiest role her character is made stronger by leoni presence and we grow to care for her robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch but his character is turned into shreds by the plot elijah wood also comes off rather successfully but he still hasn had many good roles wood stick to drama you are too talented for this stuff vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen maximilian schell is distracting but he does provide some nice humor morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this and gives one of his most shallow performances to date which is quite remarkable for him leelee sobieski could have been better but think she just suffered from poorly written character special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby eldard is good in his role but is limited by the plot crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv star trek the next generation seeing her was one of the highlights of the film overall very talented cast virtually wasted deep impact is rated pg 13 for disaster related elements and brief language this is one of the worst films of the year and if it is any omen of things to come this summer could be one of the worst ever luckily the files movie is coming up and hopefully armageddon will be more successful it shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn worth much costing nearly $75 million with special effects done by the illustrious ilm which is huge shocker and with score composed by oscar winner james horner titanic one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience well it not when the comet does hit the earth you almost wish it could just take this film along with it
my first press screening of 1998 and already ve gotten prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list what an auspicious beginning welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere firestorm the directorial debut of dances with wolves academy award winning cinematographer dean semler is the first of the new year crop of movies as our story opens the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are smokejumpers we then cut to plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl where one of the gung ho guys is taking romance quiz from cosmopolitan having the time of their lives they then jump into the middle of burning forest when even in the beginning the director can get the small parts right you can sense the movie is in trouble with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline filled cars smokejumper monica christianne hirt tells them to get away from their soon to explode vehicles not bothering to shout nor even get close to them she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people miraculously they manage to hear her and move away in movie that specializes in cheap shots the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in nearby burning building as it does throughout overly dramatic cinematographer stephen windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl face our show two heroes the crew chief wynt perkins played laconically by scott glenn and his second in command jesse graves played by howie long in weak attempt to be the next steven seagal enter the burning house looking for the little girl in panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse this mawkish show cuts back to monica who has life or death decision to make the chopper with the fire retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica two firefighting buddies she has only seconds to decide who will be saved yes she goes for the majority but miracle of miracles the other three come out alive anyway not content with traditional firefighting story chris soth screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape hoods in the woods is what the ground pounders yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire along the way shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father who was marine drill instructor most of the highly predictable movie is long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing he flings chain saw backwards over his head while riding speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck arguably the low point is when he escapes from locked burning building by riding motorcycle conveniently parked inside using ramp he shoots straight out of the top of the building attic and when he hits the ground he just rides off in cloud of dust when the film isn using some stock footage of actual forest fires the simulated ones look hokey editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions the ending with its sick twists manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise heard afterwards in the lobby it not as bad as some of the television sitcoms firestorm runs mercifully just 29 it is rated for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers
ever since wargames the first real computer hacking movie hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking these films usually show the audience look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous if it not this the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect hackers is guilty of all of these crimes to anyone familiar with computers and or the internet most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can take it anymore those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web the internet movie database are probably aware of the section for movies entitled goofs this is the section for mistakes in the movies well imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed generally ill informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology and truthfully this is one hundred percent correct the plot obviously centers around computer hacking more specifically it follows the exploits of dade murphy young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting because if it were not for that who knows where his career would be now after hackers the film opens with young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems he was forbidden to use computer until he turned eighteen years old the film then picks up at that point an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn angelina jolie cereal killer matthew lillard lord nikon laurence mason and the phantom phreak renoly santiago who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi oh and as little sub plot dade also tries to woo acid burn the only female hacker in the film really can think of much more to say about the film plot aside from what ve said it just bunch of computer geeks no obsessive compulsive computer geeks little too advanced for reality running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi thanks to this movie the public unfamiliar with computers now has distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do this movie makes computers look little bit too advanced for their time and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list to sum it up hackers is terrible computer film if you re looking for film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world suggest sneakers although at times it too may seem little far fetched it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users hopefully this film didn influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time
if there one thing just can stand it film that oozes with sentimentality here note to all film makers films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves swelling saddening music is not good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy and that the situation is hopeless alas my giant is film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that forgot as watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up what reminded me was that wasn choked up or even the slightest bit moved for that matter my giant is forced contrived and conspicuously un cute detest the word cute but ve chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create cute film here it takes premise that might have been interesting liked the preview and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience maybe it will work for some people it didn work for me billy crystal plays sam cayman an agent who at the beginning of the film is in romania he in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing film the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired get in car accident and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall his name is max gheorghe muresan and sam thinks he be great movie star because of his size subplots are as follows sam has son and wife kathleen quinlan and he never around for them so they move to chicago max is in love with woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money and so their various subplots can all be resolved sam is broke max is dying pass the kleenex my giant as comedy is only moderately funny it has its moments the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself in one great scene sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal of course his son doesn believe that he actually speaking to seagal and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is would quote the line like but it would probably lose its effect crystal is always entertaining and he has few good lines here some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely often however he countered by slew of jokes that aren funny and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes muresan is kind of fun to watch but he just can act very well quinlan on the other hand is great actress who needs to get role that shows off her talents she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff here the best thing she gets to do is fake romanian accent all of these disappointing ingredients create film that for much of its running time is simply mediocre as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion however director michael lehmann who did great job directing the underrated hudson hawk and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings sam multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed how about main character who has healthy relationship with his family later it turns out the entire story is supposed to be great big metaphor signifying sam reunion with his family and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is valiant thing but had few morality problems with it and apologize for being vague it icky it drips with gooey wannabe human emotions my giant could have been straightforward and funny family film more importantly it could have been moving on level far deeper than it is instead it complicated overlong and under engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears and since it left me feeling completely unmoved stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world
this is not simple plan about finding plane load of money and getting away with the cash this is more about parable of greed and how money can become the bane of your life yes there are elements of fargo here the snow and cold although not as vivid in the blood and gore department it shows how greed can set of chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives and how at the end of the day the things that matter most are love truth and honesty although in one sense it may seem tedious making movie about the ugliness of greed not box office material it does become tedious not because of the morale ending but because one expects the movie to end that way this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there the characters in this drama are mixture of simple and intellectual folk brothers and friends who all fall prey to the avarice of money they should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful bill paxton also gives powerful performance as the greedier younger brother whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife who indirectly causes the most problems fill room full of greedy people and several million dollars and you will end up with simple recipe for blood bath it not simple plan when you shoot everyone you love for money unless you re the menendez brothers
based on the 1960s tv series that had never seen or heard of before this movie be happy won bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons this film allows will smith to take third stab at the independence day weekend box office after scoring huge successes with men in siyah 10 directed by the same man who controlled this one and independence day 10 can you say the third times not charm plot james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation top scientists and threatening to take over the united states within week critique did not laugh once during this entire picture when you consider that this film is part comedy that not very good sign also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes when you consider that the other part of this film is geared as an action adventure would say that this another negative sign and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and little slow the story line tired reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside plot filled with lame one liners weak characterizations and an anti climactic end you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this big summer blockbuster it blows or as they say in french eet blows could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it maybe could it be that most of the special effects don show up until the last half hour and even then we don see anything that its trailers hadn already given away perhaps or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big budget movies that we cannot help but evaluate them on scale onto their own naaaaaaah bad movie is bad movie on positive note could honestly say that did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek who seemed underused in my humble opinion and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in branagh was also fun as the scenery munching over the top bad guy but that pretty much where the entertainment buck stopped smith and kline were static at best the plot full of holes and the score insignificant and derivative of dozen others would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie then again there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in cage huh oh yeah but the rest of the movie sucked little known facts about this film and its stars will smith has starred in two of the ten all time top grossing films worldwide 1997 summer blockbuster men in siyah 10 for which he also recorded the grammy winning title song and 1996 independence day 10 he once turned down scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career kevin kline is graduate of the juilliard school of drama and has been married to the cute as button actress phoebe cates since 1989 they have two kids together greta simone and owen one of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has kasdan written on it lawrence kasdan is director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies including the big chill silverado love you to death grand canyon and french kiss salma hayek gave up successful career as major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over even though she spoke no english she made her feature film debut as an actress with small role in allison anders mi vida loca no not the rickie martin video and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez desperado opposite antonio banderas since then she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez films she stands was born in southeast mexico and the daughter of lebanese father and mexican mother one of the actresses cast as branagh lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in kirmizi corner 10 another is dutch born frederique van der wal who is one of the world most recognized supermodels having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times as well as harper bazaar vogue and mademoiselle
in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa the twilight murders another one from the series is dealing with the case of gordon kahl played by rod steiger old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend year in prison than pay taxes to the despised government after being released he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest when the marshals come to arrest him it turns out that kahl isn alone many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti government beliefs and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that that brings fbi on the scene and agent mayberly michael gross is supervising the manhunt however his efforts seem fruitless since kahl still has many supporters some of them even in the local law enforcement after betrayed 1988 thriller by costa gavras hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right wing extremism in the american northwest and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing when media hype brought right wingers back into spotlight until that time only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon unfortunately the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script sometimes like many american tv movies it creates drama where drama shouldn be on the other hand film is steadily directed by dick lowry and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl on the other hand michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible however film does deal with potentially thought provoking social and political issues so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldn be the total waste of time
the following review contains spoilers it just the way we are rapist matt frewer responds to supergirl helen slater query as to why she being attacked an example of the mind numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl ll admit it love superman iii know it hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than vehicle for richard pryor but still think it worthy addition to the man of steel franchise supergirl spin off film of sorts from the series same producers alexander and ilya salkind doesn even rival superman iii in terms of quality let alone superman or superman ii supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time as the film begins we see the residents of argo city commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in inner space go about their daily lives ok what so these are exiles from krypton which blew up right were they living there before krypton exploded how do you get to inner space this whole inner space notion is never explained particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world how do they know where superman went how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me argo city is kept running by power source called the omegahedron one day the founder of argo city zaltar peter toole gives the omegahedron to superman cousin kara helen slater for use as inspiration in her art kara uses it to create bug like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of whatever that protects the city in the chaos the omegahedron sails out through the opening dooming the argonians to death in three days time or something kara then climbs into pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to minor league witch named selena faye dunaway who immediately before her dip was ruined announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel peter cook selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans and she sets out to achieve world domination selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth and that she arrived as supergirl complete with appropriate costume supergirl emerges from the bottom of lake when she arrives ok huh why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of lake attention movie explain yourself sorry can only suspend disbelief so much can buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to knowing that she needs secret identity supergirl basically wills herself into school girl outfit complete with different hairstyle picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school she given her dorm assignment and who happens to be her roommate lois lane sister lucy ok coincidence is one thing folks but we re getting really contrived now what follows are some generic all girls school hijinks complete with evil bully girls mean for no reason of course and even shower scene best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks at this point rapidly wondering why bothering with this nonsense there is some credit to give to the film however one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an evil bulldozer destroying small town in search of its prey is very well done also its commendable to see genders reversed in the film whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools hart bochner die hard is particularly fun as kara love interest lovesick landscaper who is under spell cast by selena although he is unfortunately part of one of the film more ridiculous moments when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some menacing bumper cars then there were numerous little things that bothered me the flying effects are never convincing for moment it all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires instead of having her look like she flying the filmmakers wanted her to be graceful so she poses lot and does ballet type maneuvers also who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth pair of truck drivers rapists who immediately attack her and then meet wacky demise there is also some rampant product placement in the film most notably for popeye tylenol and a&w root beer with the latter actually putting its logo on the shirt of one of the rapists finally just one word monsters faye dunaway and peter toole ham it up unmercifully however when toole overacts he entertaining and when dunaway does it she annoying her character actually says the line seize them at one point dunaway henchmen played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro fare much better with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty otis character from the first two superman movies helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent naive character she written to be as she able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable believability aside though it still annoying now despite all this negativity and not alone here supergirl is not well liked nor well respected movie in many circles leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested but excited about its release on dvd they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd to the delight of many people including myself yet still unclear as to why since this movie is so awful the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in theaters the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 35 is enhanced for 16x9 televisions and has been remastered in full thx glory extras on the disc include full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and special project consultant scott michael bosco the excellent 50 minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl the making of feature dig that workout montage trailers tv spots talent bios in depth storyboards accompanied by score from the movie and assorted still galleries the transfer on this international version is incredible you think you were watching new release images are sharp colors jump off the screen and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts only some special effects sequences show the wear of time and there just isn much that can be done about that unless you re obsessive like george lucas the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places however you ll be hearing absurd dialogue and mediocre jerry goldsmith score which is completely unrelated to john williams classic superman theme and sounds better suited for cannon films golan globus production the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there no dead air on the track bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen and we learn great deal more about the film as result of his participation although at times you can tell that bosco is looking for specific response from szwarc and is surprised when he doesn get that response we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track most notably the almost appearance in the film by christopher reeve great detail is given about superman proposed role in the original script before reeve wisely dropped out as it stands superman is written off early on in the film when we hear radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission for the sake of brevity won even get into that one szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds and everyone else agreed that supergirl needed to stand on its own replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy whimsical fantasy nonsense bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been hit at the box office again for the sake of brevity won even get into that one anchor bay has also released limited edition only 50 000 copies pressed two disc set disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release disc two features the never before seen director cut of the film which runs 138 minutes long the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don add much of note except for few moments which lengthen peter toole screen time particularly during his latter appearances the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono but fans of the film won care one question though shouldn the director commentary be on the director cut of the film never seen supergirl before sat down to watch this dvd was nine when it was released to theaters and even then was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it so when popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair had no idea what to expect knew the film wasn beloved and never had any interest in it before but was willing to give it shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc as the disc began to spin was rather impressed with the opening sequence which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo so slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started at the end of the film supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron and flies back to argo city ugh give up surprised even made it to the end of the film not once not twice but three times to review these discs supergirl is definitely terrific dvd package but very lousy movie [pg]
practical magic is film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap trap like this one the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens two sisters whose family comes from long line of witches spanning back 200 years at the start their parents die when they are still children and they go to live with their two zany aunts stockard channing and dianne wiest switch to the present day gillian who is the stronger more rebellious sibling leaves home and meets up with dark abusive guy goran visjnic while sally stays in their hometown meets and falls in love with sweet caring man has two children and then is devastated when her husband is hit by truck and killed come to think of it she not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic they accidentally murder him and in desperation bury the body in the backyard of their aunts house add to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism not to mention spattering of light hearted whimsy and you have pretty good idea how messy practical magic is after seeing the film reflected that there was not even one scene or element that liked or enjoyed it is comedy to be sure but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching it is not charming or entertaining in any way and then to top it off we ve got this dark but bird brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian body whatever the characters are handled terribly and actually most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call character there is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film and in every scene involving them they are always standing side by side no attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people the same goes for aidan quinn as handsome police investigator who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock even though he comes into it at around the 70 minute mark and once again there is no attempt to develop their relationship or his character in any way in fact every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along rather than getting to know the people saying the lines should have know was headed for trouble during the opening credits when found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman who managed to destroy the batman series with batman forever and batman and robin practical magic is directed by griffin dunne primarily an actor who last year made the contrived clumsy romance addicted to love with meg ryan and matthew broderick disliked that movie quite bit but since practical magic is even worse that can only give you taste of what talentless filmmaker he is tell him to quit while he ahead but in these last two years he ultimately already buried himself
nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre frankenweenie beetlejuice batman edward scissorhands ed wood mars attacks yet none of them have been horror films sleepy hollow is his first attempt to actually scare people greeted the prospect with high anticipation burton whole career seemed to be leading up to this left disappointed andrew kevin walker screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story the legend of sleepy hollow in the movie ichabod crane johnny depp is new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate series of murders several of the town leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning he also discovers that the killings are not random that the victims are tied together by secret along the way ichabod gets help from bewitching literally young woman christina ricci and the son of one of the murder victims marc pickering my reaction ho hum the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting that in itself is forgivable hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages however burton attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy it might be his background in his previous movies goofy was the goal along the same lines it doesn help that creature designer and producer kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue in cheek tales from the crypt tv series witch eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit tree spurts blood like it in monty python sketch and the headless horseman well he guy without head on horse boo the performances are also awful although he impressed me with his work in other films depp doesn seem to know what to do with ichabod and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that supposed to pass for an 18th century accent ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic which guarantees that we won sympathize with her character the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee martin landau and christopher walken wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola projected series of gothic adaptations series that produced only bram stoker dracula and mary shelley frankenstein coppola is an executive producer for sleepy hollow and the script reflects his interest in early forms of moving pictures particularly in toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion there bird on one side of the card cage on the other when the card is flipped rapidly the bird appears to be caged bottom line the hollow isn the only thing that sleepy

note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned was incredulous when first heard that mgm was planning sequel to their 1995 science fiction flick species squandering an intriguing premise the original film turned out to be dreadful mess widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming financial success raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite distinct lack of star power in its cast ben kingsley splendid actor but marquee name he ain miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film doubted that they dare tempt fate and go for another round so here comes species ii with new creative team director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman respectively that fails to improve the series one iota like its predecessor species ii fails to capitalize on potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid the film follows the exploits of young man patrick ross justin lazard whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women loitering in strip clubs and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can in other words patrick is like lot of guys these activities could describe the everyday routines of huge percentage of men his age but there catch he an astronaut who recently returned from seemingly successful mission to mars and who now infected with alien dna patrick overriding compulsion to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring and when he becomes aware of eve natasha henstridge half human half alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in government lab patrick primary focus turns to her if these two were to mate the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable warns dr laura baker marg helgenberger gamely reprising her role with admirable conviction species ii opens with the mars mission and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey looking even splicing back to dated grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities they really skimped on production values this time around however this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship any question as to whether or not this is cheesy movie is quickly answered mr brancato original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches like the first film and perhaps in homage to it there real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker psychic empath character upon entering bloodsoaked room something bad happened here this time laura gets to stand over fresh shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter this is awful and she not even empathic and when psychotically horny patrick accosts supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in woefully paced suspense sequence eve who telepathically linked to her alien human hybrid counterpart whatever helpfully tells our alien hunting protagonists he going to rape her while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious at least it occasionally demonstrates sense of humour of its own there an amusing tongue in cheek bit of product placement which doesn really make much sense but appreciated the sentiment as well as some supermarket related hijinx he in aisle informs eve if the film maintained this sort of light hearted tone it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch but to its detriment it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to bloody effects ladened anticlimactic conclusion much of the film fails to make whole lot of sense and there are such gaping plot holes that it terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief the implausibilities are endless what about the toxic bomb in eve brain why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual my favourite was the slow motion sequence in the film where eve sporting superhuman strength is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief incredulous that it being foisted upon the public returning headlines michael madsen who reprises tough guy press lennox and ms helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay but there realistically only so much one can do with this script as basis mykelti williamson portraying astronaut dennis gamble churns out an all too familiar spin on generic brash mouthed character and fine character actors george dzundza playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process and james cromwell patrick neglectful father senator ross are utterly wasted in the film mr lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty eyed look while returning vixen ms henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene and acquits herself nicely but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing or none at all ms henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series claiming that she so empowered lethal half alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion now that what call empowerment
the sequel to the fugitive 1993 marshals is an average thriller using it association with the fugitive just so it can make few extra bucks tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive this time he after fugitive mark sheridan snipes who the police think killed two fbi agents but of course he been set up and when the police plane escort he and gerard are riding crashes he makes run for it gerard not so hot on his tail what follows is about hours of action brought to us by the director of executive decision 1995 another film curiously involving plane when comparing this movie to the fugitive the prequel is far superior but even on it own marshals is pretty lousy movie while the original was reasonably intelligent and had fugitive to root for the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film overlong running time while the fugitive gave little time to develop harrison fords character marshals is straight in there pulling it trump card the place crash almost immediately to be honest couldn care less if snipe character got captured or not snipes performance is average and his character gets surprisingly little screen time considering he is the fugitive for reasons ll explain later tommy lee jones is as fine as ever although his role is hardly challenge the sense of deja vu was overwhelming know it the same role from the fugitive but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film there few nudge nudge references from the first film but apart from that nothing nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who roped into the chase and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife nobody looks as if their having good time and all the performers are on autopilot the supporting cast are but when it comes to performances marshals falls flat on it face it doesn fare any better plot wise either the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes but then veers off into terrorists territory as said above the film is an normal average terrorist thriller seen million times before but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional if this film wasn the sequel to the fugitive this would probably go straight to video or not even been made at all because it so average and because of the film plot changing it course snipes is almost forgotten apart and hardly features in the movie stuart baird the director is all right but there no particular scene that stands out it director is the usual action movie style even the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension the special effects are nice especially the plane crash and there good if very loud soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith but in the end marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement sure it loud and dumb but in the end marshals just ain fun bored performers and lackluster plot and script do not make good action movie overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities
one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton 1925 silent film seven chances now ve never seen seven chances as more of chaplin fan than keaton fan but seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this donnell plays jimmie shannon the manager of pool table manufacturing company he also fears commitment and despite dating anne renee zellweger for over three years he unwilling to marry her his reasons well he guy you see and well guys are like stallions and they apparently don like to be roped or something hey that the movie explanation marry renee zellweger in second eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose and when he does it the most absurd proposal ever uttered by man ever he essentially says to her you win and hands her ring the audience should now hate this character did then the meat of the plot presents itself jimmie grandfather peter ustinov completely wasted dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business however in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers jimmie must be married before his next birthday which is just over 24 hours away having blown his chances with anne jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest business proposition the movie wasn half bad by this time surprisingly it wasn boring me and even managed to read my thoughts at one point ustinov character left video will and while he reading the ridiculous clause in it thought to myself what is this brewster millions as soon as thought it hal holbrook character actually says what is this brewster millions it was quite surreal something happens though during the film final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive up to that point all of jimmie prior girlfriends had turned down his business proposition which felt was good at least the film wasn painting women to be cold hearted altin diggers when jimmie has no other options his goofy friend played by artie lange making career out of playing the goofy friend places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes front page story at this point 100 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride these women arrive at jimmie location and immediately start bullying him about what he looking for in woman when he had enough of their unjustified attacks he tells the angry mob that there been mistake and he won be marrying any of them as result the women proceed to chase him around the city in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off this goes on for the rest of the film it just chris donnell running from 100 000 obnoxious greedy angry and stupid women my groans of disgust could be heard for miles the film finally ended thankfully but to this day still groaning the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 85 cast and crew info and special dvd rom features the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc which contains scenes not in the film apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing donnell around the city and at one point donnell is leaping from the tops of buses so that was bad enough to be cut but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ugh
the happy bastard quick movie review holy man more like holy crap the film stars eddie murphy as mystical ish figure named on strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs jeff goldblum and kelly preston with flat tire on their hands somehow he ends up in their car and on their channel line up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty beyaz morgan fairchild and slew of other celebrities and nameless figures it here that he seems to hit his stride speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales at this point in the movie of course morality comes into play particularly on goldblum who suddenly feels he can market the magical into megabucks to get in good with his boss robert loggia it doesn take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points only real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild face seems to have any interest in the movie murphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if he rather be someplace else some may argue that the movie has message but all that came across to me is that could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat at least he has something for us to laught at
forget get carter instead get me cup of coffee what the hell has happened to all good american action movies did unknowingly miss meeting somewhere when did all of the bad ass kicking butt and taking names gun toting crazed vengeful characters of the 1980 from such films as commando cobra predator raw deal first blood suddenly turn into innocent compassionate sensitive teary eyed knuckleheads the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east and don mean new york city get carter the latest masterpiece from uber thespian sylvester stallone is prime example of large and in charge 80 action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up few years ago stallone made movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland strange film about redemption within broken soul stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past too bad get carter returns stallone to action but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges get carter is simple story stallone plays frank carter vegas bruiser for loan shark played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore when frank brother gets himself killed in drunk driving accident frank feeling all guilty and mushy inside thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented carter way he talks tough with his brother wife lends helping had to his brother daughter doreen rachel leigh cook and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like lost member of the rat pack with really bad goatee carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with slimy porn king played by ultra cool mcqueen esque mickey rourke multi millionaire computer geek alan cumming and strange foreign guy michael caine who speaks in riddles and talks tough carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties what minute this sounds just like another film saw last year the limey better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off actually get carter is remake of the 1971 british production of the same name starring caine in the title role and what with his cameo here the cleverness is astonishing while stallone still carries his own weight here the movie lacks what the original did as well purpose throughout the film stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough while nobody is taking him seriously his one liners fall flat and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions mental and physical required of his character there is even strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends bizarre tone to their numerous conversations in both fists and words the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs spousal abuse boxing career and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way rourke still brings dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character he may not win any oscars but he still ranks highly in my book get carter has great directing strong acting by rourke and caine and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud the only thing it lacks as with most hollywood productions is good script and proper casting never mind that it should never have been made at all

what would you do if no one could see you well if you re super smart bio molecular research scientist working for the military you grope co worker and rough up your neighbor from across the street that right of all the non criminal possibilities brought about by rendering oneself invisible in hollow man kevin bacon character opts to commit sex crimes er it kevin bacon who plays the super smart military bio molecular research scientist something sounds horribly wrong already but this is paul verhoeven film and the sleazepin director of such open crotch classics as basic instinct and the infamous showgirls never lets little credibility get in the way of his voyeuristic tendencies which when you come right down to it is all this film is about hollow man features string of hapless list actors among them bacon elisabeth shue josh brolin and kim dickens in grade plot with lot of special effects that frankly don look much better than those used in the 1933 version of the invisible man oh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he attempting reentry but otherwise it lots of thermal shots and inanimate objects elisabeth shue included bobbing around without any visible signs of support since invisibility once achieved isn much of an effect the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each other it amounts to much of muchness the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in loosely buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon character gets invisible he can head straight for them it as if that fascinating concept what would you do if no one could see you is simply verhoeven ploy to show some skin as horror film hollow man is unsophisticated and disturbing in its intent not its achievements and not worth your time or your hard earned dollars it minor verhoeven and even that not saying much and boy is it hollow
roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast who would have guessed that the most savage mad dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by ben kingsley my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark henry fonda in once upon time in the west or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it they should know that the way for film to create really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild sympathetic or even ineffectual character roles the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when role calls for him to be fierce and vicious that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast gary gal dove played by ray winstone has retired from london career of crime and is living on luxurious villa in spain life has become routine of sunning himself and relaxing but his paradise is about to be shattered by one two punch the first punch is boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa the second punch comes from gal past back in london gang boss teddy bass ian mcshane tv lovejoy is planning to break into safety deposit room in bank and he wants gal he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ben kingsley to fetch gal don will accept any decision gal makes from yes to certainly however if gal says no don will do whatever it takes to turn it into yes including threatening guy ex porn star wife deedee amanda redman in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody skin kingsley makes don compact package of fury and nastiness there are some serious problems in louis mellis and david scinto script that should have been caught before filming when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success beyond an ability to use skin diving gear no special talents are required of him any local hood could have done what gal is needed for additionally the crime involves digging from swimming pool to the bank vault flooding the vault no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool in spite of the provocative title the story is cliched and overly familiar know have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade the story is usually of the reformed outlaw robert taylor type who has hung up his guns and is trying for life of peaceful respectability the old gang however wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends rabid richard widmark type to go and git im it is not great plot in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards perhaps the film has little more respectability because it was made not as western but as stylish british gangster film it is an old plot dressed up to look new if the plot is old at least the style is creative this is director jonathan glazer first film but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences cinematographer ivan bird uses lot of half lit scenes we see one side of person faces but the other side fades into the darkness sort of metaphor for the half world these characters in habit half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden us yanks will have hard time with some of the dialog at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking the heavy accents and the cockney language sexy beast is very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here still somewhat novel genre the london crime film the plot may be new to british crime films but it would be overly familiar as western further respectability comes from ben kingsley high powered performance give it on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale
apparantly money talks and uses quite bit of obscenities doing so ve always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity film can possess whether in language violence sex or what have you find that this fact gives me little more leverage to complain when movie goes overboard and money talks definitely does it not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly and mean constantly but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged perhaps if one character were foul mouthed but in this film everybody swears nearly every other word money talks is about siyah ticket scalper named franklin hatchett played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker franklin is your typical con man and ends up with more than one person out to get him when the plot finally gets underway there no less than three people or groups that want him dead or alive the frenchman who somewhat responsible for franklin escape from prisoner packed bus hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder franklin only hope james russell charlie sheen an investigative reporter for the local news who out to prove himself worthy journalist james offers to help clear franklin name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week both of these elements are completely lost along the way however and never do reappear as expected the odd couple of franklin and james do wind up friends at the end which is another wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of becoming friends at any point along the way there is just nothing original or intriguing about this film and so many developments are either non relevant or just plain forgotten about money talks is paint by numbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience frivilous dialogue predictable flat storyline and two dimensional characters make money talks reason to save your money
starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public particularly kids wanted to see therefore it with some surprise that as big fan of the above mentioned movies was so disappointed with pocahontas despite some innovation and risk taking the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes as are its characters group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of altin with no regard for the savages that live there the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent terrible clash the ending as it turns out is not entirely happy one and is one of the film finer moments the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth governor ratcliffe for instance is snobbish single minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses captain john smith is blond hunk who while slightly misguided is good at heart pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time she even comes complete with insignificant best friend again against tradition talking animals aren used but lusty wizened talking tree is this is an odd compromise but it one of the few elements that really work the animals are delight and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to rather bland presentation maybe it would have been better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes the talking tree who seems to have thing for john smith is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch the music welcome delight in the later disney films is mostly let down here with the exception of the catchy and motivational colors of the wind mel gibson as the voice of john smith has solid singing voice and should have been used more the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character was rather bored through what turned out to be shorter than expected running time even the children in the audience seemed restless while there no stopping kid from seeing something that they want or disney wants them to most believe will be disappointed perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history it all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit movie entertainment value but doing so to historical facts doesn work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer minds and plot holes that are never filled even the artwork another disney strong point varies greatly in quality making any story problems even more obvious as mentioned above there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film for instance if john smith was truly such world traveler and had so much experience with savages why did he so quickly change his previous kill as many indians as can attitude if he was such nice guy after all he should have changed his ways long before this or how about pocahontas amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen beyaz men can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience but simply saying that they had met missionary years earlier would have cleared up lot history was modified in the film anyway as it is wonder if it doesn give kids the wrong impression in short the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions they end up failing on too many levels
plot upon the realization that they are failing all of their classes two roommates try to find third roomie who will kill himself since the school charter automatically grants top grades to the roommates of any student who succeeds in suicide critique despite this film interesting premise and dark subject matter this movie sucks because it is unfunny boring and presents us with one of tom everett scott worst acting performances add that to completely unsuccessful romance element many lame and corny jokes long wait for the setup and an ending that takes all the blackness out of this siyah comedy if you re gonna create siyah comedy don chicken out in the end see very bad things 10 for perfect example and you ve got yourself trite mtv creation worthy of its own subject matter barely laughed at any gags found the bong element contrived and repetitive and was horrified not to find any gratuitous nudity tossed anywhere in this movie if you re gonna make bad college comedy at least slap in some free t&a shots for the kids this one not even worth the rental fellas skip it altogether little known facts about this film and its stars during auditions for that thing you do tom everett scott first feature film role director tom hanks was opposed to hiring tom because of the fact that scott could ve passed for hanks 15 years ago it wasn until hanks wife rita wilson saw the audition tape and decided he was cute that hanks decided to risk hiring scott the actor who played scott cooper in this film mark paul gosselaar is best known for having played the character of zack morris on tv saved by the bell his parents are dutch and named hans and paula and who would ve guessed that this is director alan cohn first shot at directing feature film
when respecting director you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect woody allen has made couple less than good films and he my favorite even martin scorsese hasn had perfect track record kevin smith after smashing debut with the classic clerks stooped as low to sell out and make the dreadful mallrats mean so far the only director who made several films none of which have been bad is richard linklater slacker dazed and confused before sunrise and suburbia all which were great now adore quentin tarantino his first two films were classic films the second one being one of the greatest films of all time but 1995 just wasn that good of year for him he made way too many tv appearances he mispronounced jackie chan name on the mtv movie awards and he made this film he was also awarded an oscar so guess that would be grand exception robert rodriguez is also great director not brilliant one but cool one ve never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film so can comment on them but in this crap ensemble director film all four give pitiful efforts pitiful for any director too now in all fairness ensemble director pieces never really work out ve never seen all of new york stories but have heard the first two films by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap saw woody one which was hilarious but not totally up to par but will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film exposition simple one bellhop ted the totally overdone tim roth who god and all but not in this one though he has couple good moments is working on new year eve for his first shift in an old fancy hotel he the only one there again and he only has couple rooms yet again the old bellhop the seemingly immortal marc lawrence who hated pulp fiction actually hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily as the night goes on he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile yea the short films are presented in order btw the missing ingredient writer director allison anders starring sammi davis amanda decadenet valeria golino madonna ione skye lili taylor alicia witt this one starts it off horribly with no plot no intrigue and crap dialogue the situation is so terrible that it physically painful to watch the plot has something to do with coven of witches needing sperm to bring back godess who is gasp stuck inside some object in their hotel room the witch that was supposed to bring it ione skye calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it yeah that what said stupid plot inane characters who aren interesting at all etc etc etc the only good thing about this is it has good cast which in turn it wastes pitifully not even actually funny for second my rating out of no stars the wrong man writer director alexandre rockwell starring david proval jennifer beals and laurence bender another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of couple david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at coming back who are playing sex games ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon but at least this has bit of comedy in it just not that much and david proval has never overacted as much and it pulp fiction producer laurence bender who gets to puke from window masterpiece compared to the first one but still the misbehavers writer director robert rodriguez starring antonio banderes tamlyn tomita lana mckissack danny verduzco salma hayek would robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek navel nope luckily she on the tv dancing so we get to see her surprisingly enough when read the screenplay about year before actually seeing it this one seemed to have the most potential it was fast paced funny and well funny but when watched it it seemed anti climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once antonio overacts nicely and the two kids lana and danny are funny but as said it moves slowly and in that way it more painful than funny but the ending was stupid and funny at the same time oh the plot antonio is supposed gangster assumed really who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife tomita go out to get drunk at new year party antonio hires ted for couple bucks to watch his kids all night long but things go wrong it was okay the man from hollywood writer director quentin tarantino starring quentin tarantino bruce willis paul calderon and jennifer beals again ironically this one could be considered the best for bad reason it best represents what quentin has done with this film he plays chester spoiled brat actor or something who has just had huge box office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti climactic game from hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in row they re drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn light they also pay him lot of cash this is so much exactly what this little film is about that it campy tim roth was probably payed lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by bunch of people who are high on themselves cause they ve had hits major or minor it took quentin to realize that but the thing is it doesn seem like he realizes that if he did give this good stars but this sucked it was anti climactic and the dialogue wasn very good he starts off with very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes that makes no sense it cool for while then he makes it uneven it long and it just not very good hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one conclusion what the moral here if you ve made celebrated films don do an ensemble piece they should have re watched new york stories and then stopped in their tracks none of these have any point to them and they re embarrassing to not only the writer directors but to the actors cause they re working with crap but will forgive everyone involved and especially look forward to quentin next directing job even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool from dusk till dawn which found exhilerating love quentin and suppose it good he made the man from hollywood because it makes him seem more realistic and not some god of cinema seem to respect directors if they aren gods and are actually human beings who make mistakes the man from hollywood is his big mistake and let hope he doesn return her continuously
you don need to have seen the original species to appreciate how utterly lousy species ii is with few exceptions sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them but the fact that species ii is follow up isn the only reason it so miserable it the predictable storyline the cardboard characters the banal dialogue the failed attempts at humor the revolting special effects the gratuitous nudity all female of course the bad acting and the bland direction the plot simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in soil sample back aboard their shuttle the slime well sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns siyah that should have been the end of the movie right there back on terra firma at least one of the crew is now carrier of alien dna and as you ll remember if you saw the first movie driven by strong urge to procreate on parallel track government scientists have cloned version of sil from the first film now called eve again played by natasha henstridge and are keeping her around for some testing this apparently includes observing eve reaction to the dukes of hazzard tv show which she appears to enjoy eve bio rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk mates which we are forced to witness in gross out detail but otherwise there doesn appear to be whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film unless it was written into her contract let hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only eve finally breaks free of her confines and her bra for the finale but the effects are so messy you can really see what going on peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams told em not to go at the top of his lungs referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox so that he can enter high security areas flash badge and claim to be press maybe as does marg helgenberger as dr laura baker the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns they re both unbelievably wooden what talented filmmaker like peter medak the ruling class the krays let him have it doing directing this tripe wonder it an unfortunate trend this once talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like species ii last year peter hyams gave us the relic no thanks necessary there and the first species was helmed by roger donaldson who although certainly no genius behind the camera had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects is it just that there are no better offers out there species ii is worthless worse than that it also exploitative offensive and insulting to the intelligence at every turn it not that there isn anything positive to say about the film there is after 92 minutes it ends
something is fishy in the state of universal about ten years back with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior post apocalypse nitty gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies we ve always had movies of this nature on the beach the end of the world damnation alley the ultimate warrior and so on to date the most smoothly done were straightforward haircuts of the classic western plot like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization usually one in possession of some critical resource like water feed range or mining claim most of these grew out of venerable but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane my personal favorite is patrick swayze movie called steel dawn which was fairly well made on small budget now we have waterworld which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter well she not widow and the kid isn her daughter but you get the idea the lady is helen played by the stunning jean tripplehorn who isn given chance to be stunning or even interesting by the mediocre and unimaginative script the child enola played by tina majorino is living proof that child actor need not be bad thing to have in movie she outshines her material all the way through in simple the scene is earth hundreds of years from now the polar ice caps have melted and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies and survive by trade theft or piracy somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries and its inhabitants called smokers are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials so the bad guys have outboard engines and fast moving boats airplanes and jet skis enola found at sea as young girl has mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical dryland the place where trees crops and animals grow and what plot there is hinges on who has enola the psycho ruler of the smokers the deacon is trying to get her and find his way to dryland played with typical self lampooning rug chewing histrionics by dennis hopper deacon is the only thing in the movie that close to amusing his performance is almost laughable but there just isn enough there to be funny the star and co producer is kevin costner he playing an un named lone denizen of the sea man called the mariner who turns out to be gilled water breathing mutant with webbed feet very little is done with this the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support human metabolism it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted much of the earth surface would still be above water and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown canned meat does not last for centuries ammunition does not fire after it more than few decades old and so on and so on quite fond of tina majorino previous work very impressed by jean tripplehorn past accomplishments and still speechless over costner dances with wolves but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it this movie cost one hundred and eighty two million dollars and there nothing in it we haven seen before done better on only few percent of the cost of this turkey at 125 minutes of material this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make the budget of this movie could have given us over thirty movies it could have paid for six years of prime time sf tv series with expensive fx work or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx in sum this movie is beneath contempt it has nothing new to offer it has script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc and it spent more money than the national budget of small nation if you have to go see it see it on four dollar matinee otherwise you ll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass reflective surface for weeks
this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation but lo and behold here comes switchback and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as kiss the girls and know what you did last summer but switchback is an undoubtedly weak genre entry as the material it covers is old and tired and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting switchback opens with the murder of babysitter and the abduction of the young child she watching we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse dennis quaid and that the kidnapper killer is nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite while he is promptly removed from the case but this conflict of interest doesn keep him from offering pursuit lacrosse most recent trek takes him to blood soaked hotel room in amarillo texas where the local sheriff lee ermey is torn between his re election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man in related aside former railway worker bob goodall danny glover is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup plastered even on the seatbelts el dorado along the way he picks up and subsequently saves the life of hitchhiking loner lane dixon jared leto this tangent isn random one as bob or lane will end up either holding piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself or is the villain in fact lacrosse only pretending to be after the cold hearted murderer he knows so much about in sense that half of the basic problem with switchback for its first hour the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator so we re given little insight into who they are likely for fear that we ll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction but switchback then decides to explicitly reveal the killer identity at its midpoint and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense some of the acting is burdensome area as well probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves what is danny glover doing here grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot and dennis quaid that monotone stop it ermey is solid in supporting role that more interesting than the two leads thrown together but the charismatic leto claire danes object of affection in my so called life is scene stealer tried and true >from material standpoint switchback is pretty empty but even when first time director jeb stuart who wrote the fugitive and die hard doesn know what to do he knows what he wants it to look like the movie provides some great visuals the set on train climax looks good even though the action is illogical and the beautiful crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor still that not enough to turn lump of coal into diamond and more than the movie look will end up leaving you cold

plot based on the wildly popular jerry springer tv show this movie follows the lives of two groups of people before they make their bizarre appearances on the infamous program one posse comes from the trailer parks and are to be featured in the slept with my stepfather segment and the other is based on some fly girl whose girlfriends keep sleeping with her undevoted dog boyfriend critique the truth is that if didn have day job would probably watch the real jerry springer show every day find it quite entertaining despite its complete lack of redeeming value having said that the show itself is outrageous funny and always filled with goofy surprises as opposed to this film which features no laughs is this comedy or drama uninteresting and completely unbelievable one dimensional stereotypes and contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way never thought would utter the word boring in the same sentence as jerry springer but this film is an absolute yawn fest despite offering various scenes featuring simulated blowjobs lesbians t&a and tv violence who would ve guessed that wish they would have either made this movie much much funnier or turned it into complete drama and given us real perspective as to why people like this actually put themselves through these public forums of embarrassment unfortunately it doesn seem as though screenwriter jon bernstein spent more than drunken weekend watching real jerry springer reruns to complete his script leaving us with boring film featuring no laughs one dimensional characters and no fun whatsoever little known facts about this film and its stars jerry springer used to be the mayor of cincinnati ohio for this film he won the 1999 razzie award for worst new star tied with joe esterhas from an alan smithee film burn hollywood burn
never understood what the clich hell on earth truly meant until very recently ve just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying so horrible so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as hell on earth after all ve never been to war ve never been the victim of any violent crime ve never really been broken hearted and ve never been audited so really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was hell on earth then saw cruel intentions in perfect world would be in charge of all the movie studios the very first thing do in this perfect world would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with 20 something cast playing teenagers and featuring soundtrack ripped directly from mtv and throw them in jail but it wouldn just be your average jail not even maximum security installation have these producers and everyone else involved in the production of these films put in front of war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity now you re probably thinking to yourself is this really how bad cruel intentions is the answer is no it actually much worse watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumble awfully written script is probably lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound and then pouring acid on the salt don know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum tara reid whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet but the only emotion felt was sheer boredom from that opening scene where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz to the conclusion which don remember because had practically fallen asleep cruel intentions is truly hell on earth right up there with war and tax audits
about an hour or so into the jackal character wandered around as people were being shot at in big suspense sequence and one of the audience members in the theatre saw it in shouted out hope she gets killed now at that point it hit me didn care for any of the characters being played by actors didn really like when the sole reason you care about character being played by sidney poitier in suspense film is because he being played by sidney poitier you know something rotten in the state of denmark every year couple films like this are released you know the cheap action packed international espionnage film featuring semi promising premise some big name actors usually bruce willis and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago this was the third one of 97 following the very lackluster the saint which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe and the surprisingly fun the peacemaker featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain the jackal tries to mix both elements and you thought the saint was bad the jackal is loosely very loosely hope based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that ve yet to see the day of the jackal which featured apparently suave hitman called the jackal played by edward fox trying to assasinate charles degaule well welcome to the 90s where sorta suave hitman also called the jackal bruce willis trying to kill the head of the fbi or is he after being hired by russian mob lord as bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother killed in the opening scenes the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere from helsinki to virginia setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he ll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion and like the saint the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people the agent working on the case cater preston sidney poitier yes that sidney poitier working with russian agent valentina koslova diane venora lady capulet from romeo juliet gives up early on and meets with an ex ira man declan mulqueen richard gere putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of 97 who in massachusetts jail but who has apparently seen the jackal who has been eluding the law forever soon he out working with the two untrusting agents and trying to help them catch him there are numerous problems with the film and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put finger on the film is supposed to be big suspense thriller but save couple moments the film never achieves suspense or even sense of intrigue sure the big assasination attempt is bit cool looking and even slightly tense but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register the film never picks up enough to become thrilling experience or even an entertaining one it doesn help that the plot is designed to be complex but falls into so many problems like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances the script of the jackal is complete mess mostly because it can decide what it wants to focus on is this film about man trying to find redemption by catching nasty killer is it film about nasty amoral hitman who in everything for the money or is it combination of both the jackal aims for the latter but never focuses in on either character the connection between the two feels completely edited so much that in scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan you wonder how he recognized him so fast the worst part is the little past they try to give declan most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend isabella mathilda may given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then the supporting characters are worse sidney poitier is given completely unplayable role that of man who is just stern sometimes and other times more giving and likable what is poitier doing here he one of the best living actors does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this diane venora russian character is almost as bad with cigarette perpetually in her mouth and plastered on expressionless facade it not that anyone bad here it that they have nothing to do the plot is joke feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain there are several times where he in tight situation and makes things worse for himself the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in cheap thrill take scene where he being followed by some agents into parking garage he quickly sprays his car another color and adds solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it doesn killing someone attract more attention than it does distract and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in public place geez is there anything good here well couple things did like willis icy expressions he may not have been real suave or anything but some of his looks are worth chuckle richard gere has couple of good moments making his character as likable as he possibly could have and couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous completely inane but fun kinda way most notably sequence where he tests out new gun on an annoying gun builder jack siyah and bit where he seduces gay washington man which has its share of couple good jokes most particular kiss by willis but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go they re just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is the jackal director michael caton jones who directed the far superior rob roy has made film that is made very couple months one that is unentertaining unintriguing and pretty much cold but will nevertheless make money because hey the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro clancy kinda way every now and then the filmmakers get it right clear and present danger which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way but the jackal is an example of when they go completely wrong
showgirls is the first big budget big studio film to receive an nc 17 rating and its release last year came at time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence but if showgirls is any indication of hollywood future the folks in washington should focus their attack on more dangerous threat to american values bad moviemaking showgirls is relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas who collaborated on another shock value project 1992 basic instinct follow the plight of young woman teen tv star elizabeth berkley determined to make name for herself as topless dancer it hackneyed premise to begin with so not surprisingly all of the stock characters are trucked out there the demanding producer the loyal friend the bitchy competitor lest forget the scummy club owner of course any attempt at character development or coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film main attraction an endless parade of full frontal nudity unfortunately showgirls doesn satisfy in this department verhoeven slam bang in your face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic to make matters worse you ll be forced to sit through the movie clothed scenes which don cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground but if it adult entertainment you want stay home and watch the playboy channel you ll be the wiser for it
here concept jean claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie now if that isn enough to get you to finally see van damme movie don know what is all sarcasm aside it is certainly different way to start movie of course few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had twin brother so lucky us we get to see more of jean claude van damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives van damme #2 is police officer in france who finds out that he had twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france the remaining twin the french cop goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death once there he hooks up with his deceased brother girlfriend played by natasha henstridge and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are jean claude acting abilities don seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie in other words just in case you missed the sarcasm his acting is worse than normal on the upside natasha henstridge is in this film and she does what she did best in species she gets naked sadly this is probably the high point in the movie she is actually decent actress but didn improve as much as thought she would after species this is the typical van damme movie with jean claude doing variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents nothing new here and certainly nothing we haven seen in every other van damme movie simply put there is absolutely nothing new about this movie it has retread plot this isn the first time jean claude has played twins he still can act we all saw natasha breasts in species although this is one repeat performance not complaining about this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in sub par
what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just predictable lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films john frankenheimer who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60 recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin screenwriter ehren kruger gave remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes even charlize theron who was convinced couldn act did decent job in cider house rules when all of these bright stars come together one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games disbelief was my first reaction then frustration the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given fair amount of improvisational rights we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set it is so apparent in number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at bar the actors in that movie were having fun and from that the audience had fun reindeer games is the complete opposite the actors don seem to want to be their characters even danny trejo who will do practically anything doesn look like he is enjoying himself causing the audience to quickly lose interest evidence of public disapproval was noted when woman behind me yelled boy this movie is horrible and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments the story follows man rudy ben affleck who is leaving prison in few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick james frain nick has been exchanging love letters with beautiful woman ashley charlize theron and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person when nick is killed in prison riot rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on date for the christmas holidays unfortunately ashley brother gabriel gary sinise interferes with their relationship thinking rudy is nick he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob casino which nick use to work at as security guard now rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel confused the movie only gets more complex as it goes on until it gets way way too complex at its climax but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour the hero commits greedy selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley some hero the point of hero is to do the morally correct thing person for the audience to relate to or admire when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times the most irritating part of the film besides the fact that this is christmas movie released in february is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays especially when eagerly want to see the hero dead the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as prisoner upset with his food why he was in this movie for such pointless role beats me why any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me
dreamworks skg running time hours starring robert duvall tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year the second is the macho armageddon is actually dull affair elijah wood plays leo biederman who during astronomy class discovers that large asteroid is heading for earth tea leoni plays rather crap news reporter jenny lerner who soon discovers about this asteroid through very long winded and boring way and robert duvall plays the leader of space crew spurgeon tanner who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth also featuring is morgan freeman as the president and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny father and mother while many people will walk into the film expecting big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up as the trailers seem to promise the film is actually more of character study if very poor one the main problem is that there are too many characters in the film and not enough time to explore them all only the space crew are given any depth jenny lerner leo and the president are surprisingly 2d and we never get to know these characters and because couldn care for them didn really give crap if the asteroid killed them or not the script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple and never really makes any interesting statements mimi leder the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker 1996 again directs in ho hum style and never really gets any emotion out of scene which is shame the cast are seemingly on autopilot although tea leoni does gives rather good performance even if she acts bit too dorky for her own good she seems uncommonly stupid for journalist robert duvall is on autopilot with underwritten role he just seems to be in this film for the money elijah wood one of the best child actors working today is surprisingly average although his choice of roles lately haven exactly been brilliant flipper 1996 his role is also vastly underwritten morgan freeman again is utterly wasted with ridiculously underwritten role like duvall he just seems to be in the film for the money the supporting cast are all none making much of an impression ok so deep impact may have messed up character wise but surely the special effects are good well yes and no although the special effects should be impressive with massive tidal wave destroying new york the special effects look like well special effects sadly the waves looks like it been drawn on computer and doesn look too good at all surprising really when the effects are done by industrial light magic who did the effects for the lost world and twister in the end deep impact is wasted opportunity what could of been moving movie with good effects turns out to be dud in both characters and effects the hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect once again dreamworks has churned out another average movie let hope armageddon is bit better overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities
seen may 1998 at 40 at the crossgates cinema 18 theater #13 with chris wessell and sean shea for $5 [theater rating very good sound picture and seats] the big budget mega hype event movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming weekly routine instead of seasonal one gluttony is hollywood favorite sin but it is the movie goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever worsening basis lost in space is the latest such offering film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre it made up of every element of science fiction but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for audiences attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films this one opens with fast paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film probably because it has star wars written all over it but as the producers way of showing off their budget through the special effects battle scenes are worthless without tension and since we have no idea what the setting is it impossible to care about anything that happens in essence the entire segment works like teaser for an arcade game not piece of filmmaking we meet the robinson family family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources each member of the family has special trait and personality and yet none of them seem like actual people professor john robinson hurt is the intelligent quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it it obvious what role this aspect will play of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other while the necessary problems are resolved at the right moments the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it presented in completely serious manner without trace of satire and is so pathetic it laughable the first act is not building of story but juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements such as plot conflict and characterization god forbid we re provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent in fact it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non existent yes the characters do speak but they do not talk they say things that only relate to the conflict but they never really interact unless it the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west leblanc and uptight unemotional judy robinson graham it amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens eventually the pacing rapidly increases but the amount of genuine interest does not the story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr smith oldman the cartoony villain and his plans for sabotage what ensues is series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as alien lite the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive but there never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly plotlines are developed but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes but it presented in such ridiculous way it utterly boring by the time the last act rolls around there is no sense of payoff building the ending does not go out on high note with any kind of climax instead it seems to come to sudden halt but at least it ends at all lost in space is major film production at its worst it frightening that film so poorly written directed and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment
the only thing worse than watching bad movie is realizing that the film had lot of potential and could ve been effective such is the case with _urban legend_ the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house the killer wears one of those bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up so you can see the face guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days anyhow the premise is certainly nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric it very good setup that promises more chills to come unfortunately the film never takes off from there the movie takes place on peaceful new england college campus like most slasher flicks this one also centers around young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by knife wielding maniac or in this case an axe wielding maniac ve always wondered why these killers don save themselves lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill after the fine first scene the movie degenerates into monotonous series of those annoying you thought it was the killer but was just someone else scares these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music guess sudden sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast the slasher appears attacks the victim is eviscerated and the tedious cycle appears anew false scares should always be used in moderation someone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren as scary as they used to be this movie commits the biggest sin horror film can commit it not frightening remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in _scream_ and _scream 2_ this movie still adheres to them tons of illogical moments about more than really have the inclination to list and don mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense that type of illogical can be fun this film insults your intelligence more times than care to remember the last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you ll be laughing more than you ll be screaming actually you won be screaming at all at its best the acting can barely be called adequate and the script could ve definitely used rewrite or two the film still manages to have some strong points the killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans there are some intentionally funny moments these were exceeded by the unintentional ones the film is well made from technical standpoint besides the first part there is also another good scene prolonged cat and mouse chase inside radio station if there had only been more sequences like this that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music _urban legend_ might ve been worth your money
my opinion on film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors love love ralph fiennes love uma thurman love sean connery hell even big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago and ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever since few months into the summer however noticed that its release date had been changed few times and that it had ended up in the mid august dumping ground then in this final week before its official release learned that it was not to be screened for critics and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique my expectations fell to pieces when learned all of these things the film saw today didn even meet those expectations this is lousy incoherent mess would slam it harder if it weren for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine lovable actors but sets are ultimately empty and the performances are completely uninspired that the main problem with the avengers for all it hip hop flash and tidal waves none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired it like chore bland exercise in superhero film making it also feels like its been cut to pieces clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots this is just plain depressing the avengers is film version of the popular 60s television show frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that ve never watched an episode wasn alive then don even watch television now very sorry that don have this perspective but judging from the reviews ve already read knowing the tv show just makes matters worse didn know and love john steed and emma peel and therefore was not as upset to see how these actors love have managed to thrash their roles also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film based on what the film told me gather that steed fiennes is some kind of british super guy somewhat like james bond and that dr peel thurman is just really smart doctor who also happens to know lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits they are to work together under mother orders mother is played by jolly jim broadbent while his co conspirator father is played by the equally talented fiona shaw it seems that there is man out there controlling the weather his name is de wynter connery he is crazy scottish guy our heroes had better stop him or else the weather will keep getting colder until they have to go to hell to warm up one of the film few funny lines along the way there is subplot after subplot hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere feel perfunctory and ultimately make no sense for example our heroes are eventually attacked by swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos now killer bugs don really go with the weather controlling theme of the film the purpose of the bugs other than to annihilate our heroes is never established they re never even directly connected to de wynter they re controlled by his crazy henchman played by eddie izzard the special effects aren bad but they re loud obnoxious and intrusive like so many scenes in the film it seems present only to keep your attention from waning and guarantee you it will wane stopped thinking about the story when realized it didn do any good to think the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn tell us what happens there are several scenes in the preview that didn make the final cut in addition many of the sequences have irritating grainy film quality which makes it feel low budget the last scene is particularly bad the scenes that don feature action should be electric thanks to our wonderful cast they aren the action scenes should be electric because this is an action film they aren either and what about this wasted cast oh it makes me weep with disappointment we re talking ralph fiennes here one of the best actors working today one of the best actors ever love the guy ve loved all his films until this one he seems like he wants to understand the film but he as lost as we are and thurman in all of her spectacular beauty and talent can manage to look at home here don blame her completely for there is strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way and it can be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting connery however seems the most out of it totally lacking any kind of focus or interest for that matter who is to blame is it the screenwriter don macpherson perhaps although can see shell of story here that could have been good superhero movie had it been handled right is it the actors for god sake no these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling blame director jeremiah chechik who shouldn have been given the task to begin with his best film benny joon is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be but here it mostly seems like lot of failed attempts at wit and humor add to that lack of experience in big budget action and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory if the avengers has saving grace it the set design the sets by stuart craig are big colorful and often pleasing to look at like the final set piece on de wynter island even if none of it makes bit of sense admired the overhead view of the stairs showing dr peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere also enjoyed michael kamen music score particularly in the opening credits but this stuff is routine good sets and music are nice but there lot more that needs to be here inspiration for instance would have been really nice maybe little bit of cohesion in the story or sense of purpose most of all though would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles damn this movie for not giving them the chance
if snake eyes were dog you put it to sleep if it was couch you put it out on the sidewalk where it would sit for week if it were your child you be reading military school catalogs if it were ship no it wouldn be the titanic that would imply glamor and tragedy it would be the exxon valdez personal side note saw this movie on the road during houston business trip for whatever reason my hotel cable system wasn showing the astros braves game which featured randy johnson greg maddux matchup this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching perfectly good baseball game for free so the invective deserved as it is should be seen in that perspective snake eyes is supposed to be mystery movie and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater snake eyes is not good mystery movie but had some questions where the manager and how do get re admit pass if fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rent car can sue brian de palma is it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage oscar will someone please begging you give gary sinise role worthy of his talents and how exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer if you ve seen the trailer without seeing the movie consider yourself fortunate the trailer is work of sheer genius it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie the noteworthy steadicam work the exuberance of cage performance as thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman the essential elements of the marginal plot the expert craftsman who pieced together fairly good trailer out of snippets of wretched movie deserves praise and percentage of the gross is best trailer category at the oscars that far fetched after all but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie the trailer sets up what should have been promising plot detective ricky santoro cage must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay per view boxing match unfortunately there are multiple problems afoot the trailer gives away much too much of the story the shooter is killed instantly so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy the film secret is ho hum at best and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is without an interesting plot without interesting dialogue and without much of reason to care about the characters or the story snake eyes is failure on almost every possible level as much as hated this movie must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit de palma is maddeningly inconsistent he can on his day create amazingly well done movies the untouchables carlito way on off days he can be well just horrid the bonfire of the vanities raising cain snake eyes falls into the horrid category but there are couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film school degree of difficulty value the steadicam opening scene does good job of introducing the cage character and is virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor there is split screen chase scene that looks pretty good and it followed by god eye view of bank of hotel rooms that imaginitively done this is what called giving the devil his due but the technical skill doesn even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie placing plot holes to one side for moment snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps and perhaps the worst most overly drawn out ending in years snake eyes is criminal act an evil waste of time and talent cage sinise and yes even de palma deserve better the audience deserves better but no refund no re admit pass no free popcorn coupon can ever restore to us the time we ve spent or wash the awful images from our mind however we are left with one consolation that we were warned by the movie title because snake eyes is nothing more than roll of craps
the last line or near to that honor is the great butler alfred the ubergod michael gough saying think we need bigger bat cave or something to that note that exactly what this film is too big for its own good because it has too damn much cut batgirl out cut one of the villains it too much to handle in one dosage it so much that characters get left behind poor elle gets mere scenes and subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way shape or form and elle deserves better this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher it also the fourth worst in the series and second worst from joel the series has been declining since its stunning debut followed by the almost as stunning sequel and then the anti climactic third one first by joel this one not anti climactic knew it was gonna suck it up to joel to make it fun though batman forever was fun this is big bore of over produced action sequences and shallow characters mean this one bit gonna put all the plot in one paragraph mr freeze ah nold who wife was dying of some disease has become the new big villain these days he huge ex scientist who fell into some weird liquid hello joker and now has body temperature of big fat zero and has mavi body batman george and robin chris fight him bit but find they re growing apart meanwhile another villain shows up poison ivy uma who was dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with twistet scientist john glover who kills her when she finds out he used her research to develop an uberman bane who is basically man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had she emerges from her chemicals don ask cause can tell ya as sexy woman the real uma who poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo meanwhile alfred dying of the same disease mr freeze wife has but in an earlier state than she and his niece barbara alicia comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade but soon well not really soon it takes her hours becomes batgirl meanwhile in an unfinished subplot bruce batman alter ego if you forgot has been dating the lovely julie madison the even lovlier elle macpherson who wants commitment after year but he says nothing end of her for all we know mr freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population don ask the trio must team together as family to beat them there ya go not the whole story but no big context clues too much right right the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for couple good sequels however while tim burton nicely balanced the villain batman storyline although not wonderfully joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one he gets some corny speeches couple clever lines and that it maybe some stunts for all this can even comment on george clooney as batman hardly saw the guy and when did he had horrible dialogue to say think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode george is in between them he not quintessential he not horrible he good but sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they ll be critically murdered for this sorry effort we ll get good script and clooney will shine if he still has the job the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher last time we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey this time we have somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain the same guy mr freeze we feel bad for his mental physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants arnold isn very good too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points when he watches old movies of his wife he actually looks somber wow but uma makes the most of her seductive character getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness it like she almost parodying herself in pulp fiction at points she incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much star better as for the lower bat people chris is the same as he was in batman forever although think his work in these is too hokey when he best at quieter parts in scent of woman or just plain cool parts in fried green tomotoes alicia love the girl but she not particularly good in this film she can hypotheitically act we all saw that in clueless but her lines kinda sound weird and it isn the mushy mouth this time but in all fairness she has virtually no part joel gets around to her occasionally and when she on she does stupid stuff although know not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma and poor elle poor poor elle love that woman and she can also hypothetically act for those of us who saw sirens but she has no part it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product there are no couch scenes like my best friend noticed now listen to me on this one in every batman flick there couch scene in the original it was with vicki in returns it was good make out scene with selena and in the last one it was chat with nicole this one it nothing and batgirl does next to nothing in this film till the end when she suddenly part of the family fortunately we get lot of alfred he the always reliable butler in case you didn know who has been with bruce all his life he god he father figure he also dying this got to me love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in robe not in his tux and freaking dying just gets to me we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time but this is never answered as this film is too cluttered but in defense it does have some good parts other than uma for one george is good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do and there are some nice touches when they show the asylum at one point they show the patient belongings in room and we see the riddler costume laughed and during biker scene involving robin and batgirl another subplot never handled past initiation period we not only see coolio but bunch of bad asses dressed as droogs from clockwork orange laughed at all these the film falls apart around the five minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes or did it just feel like that the film should serve as another in the long line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays people are fed up with stupid films that why the word of mouth killed the lost world that why last year indy films grossed more than ever that why this will have strong box office initative from people who just want to see it like me but will die after week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it that why the next two big budget aciton pics are john woo face off and barry sonnenfeld men in siyah both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on like joel schumacher more as person than an artiste like some of his films flatliners time to kill but lot of them suck he really eccentric person and loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being mediocre director and that what makes him great but his costuming for woody allen sleeper was more interesting than this one and his costuming was cool look for the nazi number love the batman series the first two rocked and did like the last one but this one is not going to be one that watch repeatedly like the other three hopefully this will also serve as springboard to better batman next time and maybe they ll get smart and bring back catwoman and michael keaton but we can only hope
writers dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer starring jamie lee curtis william baldwin donald sutherland joanna pacula sherman augustus marshall bell cliff curtis julio oscar mechoso suppose not extremely surprised that virus comes to us from deciple of james cameron john bruno and if strain real hard could even say that it an obvious given particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr cameron early works in fact virus is yet another in the long line of action horror paranoia thrillers from the aliens vein group of people are dropped into mysterious situation only to find mortally threatening entity is out to get them textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies and maybe even to the first pictures albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future no such thing will happen to bruno whom believe worked in some capacity on that quasi landmark feature while bruno may have studied under cameron wing for years and years beginning to wonder at what capacity and what exactly did he learn from him in fact virus should at least be mediocre the fact that bruno could have worked under man like cameron director who if anything just knows how to make movie and then make film like virus is just another detraction fairly aimed at this grade schlockfest of film albeit grade schlockfest with respectable budget the film seems to not only borrow it plot from last year similarly fated deep rising but also from clunkish movie from the 80s called leviathan an underwater thriller starring peter weller richard crenna hector elizando and daniel stern about group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part alien part john carpenter twisted remake of the thing virus again has similar uh selling point group of sailors on boat stumble upon russian cruiser that is dead in the water they get on they break up into pairs and investigate and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy has taken over all the machines on board have meshed the machines with parts from corpses and have deemed humankind their enemy because of misquote in the dictionary ha ha not that any of this is for second scary or the least bit involving not only does this film start off with chintzy bond ian opening the destruction of the cruiser via satellite transmission from mir destroying any of the suspense in what could happen but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters of its motley crew it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters lead woman skipper masculine potential romantic interest drunken captain siyah technician tatooed aborigine manic russian survivor and couple other candidates for alien food none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than thin plain piece of writing paper and it not the traditional argument for films like these where you may in fact want them all to be eaten even aliens played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers but this was more of plus side for the film as whole than the opposite instead as another cliche goes you just don give damn almost don even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub par to horrific the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what strong female lead she is and she is just not really here and the latter being and it pains me to say this as he particular favorite of mine donald sutherland who plays the captain so poorly and without second of credibility that this will go down as the performance of which he should be ashamed like anthony hopkins for legends of the fall the line scrooooooo em has been thus embroidered upon my membrance or peter toole in caligula great actor horrific performance it happens every now and then and it only helps sutherland career that no one except for an elite few even bothered to see this film though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can read early january when everyone still trying to catch up on the potential oscar nominees it does show that universal shelled out pretty penny to make this film it laden with complex machinery boasts respectable production design and it may even feature believable special effects if of course or anyone else could see them virus mostly takes place on large abandoned cruiser and mostly at night until the dawn and mostly without the use of lights not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey but more so because as the hollywood cliche seems to go if it dark enough then the special effects will be more believable and if you don believe me go back and rent godzilla and tell me if there even one shot where we see godzilla either in his entirety in one wide shot or the light so that we can at least see him well you don really have to sit through it again just take my word for it but all of this doesn matter since virus is basically just one loud cluttered mess of movie the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie ve ever seen my um favorite part was the scene where trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship during five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves rain and any other ocean extremeties the film can cook up then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned well must say thanks for telling me afterwards because sure couldn figure it out when saw it imagine the first attack of the aliens in aliens shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity and that basically the whole of virus one horribly directed action scene after the other capping it off with proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least couple of the original cast members and my god it long damn sit with no interesting characters no dramatic urgency no tension not one good moment of action and no mesmerizing visuals it wonder that it even got made we already know that big movie studios mentality is shallow at best and movies like out of sight and saving private ryan give you more faith in them but movies like virus manage to drain little more out of the pool almost wish that instead of making this movie john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film green light they read the script they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into director who might have very well been cameron hack and he is and they still went ahead with the project only to have bruno and company shit back in their face even though hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie say even more contempt should be aimed at mr bruno for making movie that could be this bad in fact shouts of egad man what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway are not only justifiable but encouraged

this is your definitive hollywood movie extremely predictable following the basic formula horrible ending overzealous writing meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise ass character of which we ve seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly wasn used enough here afraid the film would have been completely unbearable in this film ashley judd plays women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for weekend while in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her over money how original while in jail she works out exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition now she has learned about law titled double jeopardy stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works now her po parole officer and bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims skipping over to the acting the fact that judd is more of looker than an actress no offense she has been good [simon birch] and even very good to great [kiss the girls] at times in the past and believe may have the potential to be better but she terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying doesn really add to the movie at all just takes away as said jones was fine although he did not have much to work with he was much more of supporting character which is fine and he handled it well especially considering the material he had to work with feel this film had alot going for it originality not being an issue the acting was the only thing as said keeping it alive the plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better the action scenes were well made however sometimes out of place was just left unsatisfied in the long run so basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely over thought the plot has certainly been done before generally speaking the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot and is basically film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones who if he had some more screentime could perhaps have earned the film higher rating in my book anyway keep this in mind if you re in the mood for good action film rent the fugitive d+
it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of todays movies or novels you must suspend disbelief however there is distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing bunch of flat lies it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg indiana where the film is set does not have mcdonald sears store statue of man on horse nor even dam close by even if you can ignore these somewhat white lies even though the dam is crucial to hard rains plot there is still bunch of things that just dont gel firstly morgan freeman possibly the greatest actor alive after such films as driving miss daisy the shawshank redemption and se7en was cast as shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for healthy retirement he _should_ have played the town sheriff an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman as massive flood started by dam accident overwhelms huntingburg its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them and it seems tad strange that an entire town with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way can vanish before the flood has actually started but nether the less armored guard couriers tom christian slater and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van with heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads it doesnt take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road jim morgan freeman and small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars but of course tom is more than willing to save the day so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town the local sheriff randy quaid whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 and couple of police men investigate the situation but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he she would do with their share of the three million dollars director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy turvy and whilst the film may at first appear to be definite goodies versus baddies there are numerous twists in its plot that make this slightly more enjoyable experience but by the time these interesting changes occur its far too late in the film for them to have much affect hard rains continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had and although its cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par not at one stage capturing what could have been fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected such titles as broken arrow slater and john travolta and face off nicholas cage and john travolta come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations strangely enough they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta we can forgive morgan freeman for giving slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost movie prior to the release of broken arrow my answer would have been definite no now know that he has no excuse and _can_ do better if you dont believe me rent copy of broken arrow from your local video store although hard rain never really works from the start somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen the addition of an enticing sub plot would have given the film time to breathe rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into story that cant handle anything else despite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account if your standards are low enough you may find this to be mildly enjoyable film no creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors but it doesnt really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $8 50 is compare this to other films
play it to the bone is punch drunk mess of movie containing good cast but awful acting an interesting premise but terrible execution ron shelton beyaz men can jump gives us rocky story with not one rocky but two rocky no is vince boudreau woody harrelson edtv bald tattooed newly converted christian whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as curse word something that he has not yet successfully achieved rocky no is caesar dominguez antonio banderas the 13th warrior best friend of vince who is currently dating vince ex girlfriend grace both men are nearing the end of their almost careers when fluke provides them with redemptive opportunity when both fighters of the undercard of vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated the fight promoters need to find quick replacement our boys are tapped to fight each other the winner of which is promised shot at future title fight the film is divided into two sections at first we have buddy road picture as our two heroes in grace sassy grassy green muscle car travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by once in vegas the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar both mr harrelson and mr banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past not that we know it from their work here mr harrelson is uncomfortably awkward apparently never having gotten firm handle on vince the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable mr banderas is uncharacteristically non charismatic as caesar weak and ineffectual there is little life in his screen performance the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another tom sizemore saving private ryan robert wagner austin powers ii the spy who shagged me and richard masur fire down below are crooked promoters lucy liu payback is sex starved hitchhiker looking for good time and lolita davidovich gods and monsters is the shared girlfriend who can make her mind up which boxer she prefers because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them the film flounders with all the appeal of dead fish until the boxing match actually begins but even then because the outcome is so predictably obvious the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other writer director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed well choreographed well edited and well performed if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film as it is the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable the title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film the phrase play it to the bone is reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you ve achieved your desired goal that is biblical principle know ye not that they which run in race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain corinthians 24 [kjv] achieving anything worthy in life requires playing it to the bone we need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives this is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives as movie play it to the bone is hardly worth our time but as principle of life the phrase play it to the bone are words to live by
have no real tangible proof of this but swear that there are lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take bad script written by bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director then it is actually possible to make good movie using their logic all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into good movie is cast bunch of super famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget this is the only way can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre now before continue to ferociously attack what wrong with this film just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller catherine zeta jones plays virginia baker an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal sean connery if you ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before really don have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details the two team up for various jobs stealing various things for various purposes the problem we come to is that we ve all seen this few billion times before and this film doesn break any new ground in the big budget hollywood action genre the result is that the entire production feels contrived going to be completely honest here pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run time was looking at catherine zeta jones now while this may be compliment for ms zeta jones it certainly isn for either the writers or the director who are not nearly as clever as they think they are just about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between entrapment and blackmail with an eighty million dollar budget you think that entrapment would at least feature edge of your seat action scenes or breathtaking special well you be wrong the action that is present in this film takes place in huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular unfortunately for all those involved with entrapment die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by 11 years the reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture you know exactly what going to happen despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists many scenes seem to exist merely as reason to outfit zeta jones in extremely tight fitting clothing one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask nothing wrong with that but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was so why didn she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ll tell you why because it great excuse to photograph zeta jones posterior as it slides underneath those beams and it also allows second scene of the exact same thing the rehearsal ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie and though he has great screen presence although so do connery and zeta jones and the most interesting character in the film not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss concept invented just to describe this picture one last complaint entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into shadow or behind building or he becomes obstructed by moving vehicle and then in the next shot he ll spontaneously disappear in ninja like fashion can picture amiel patting himself on the back thinking to himself it ll leave the audience wondering for days how did he do that we know jon it called editing
when originally saw the trailer for analyze this few months ago must admit thought it looked kind of lame and then when the commercials started popping up week or two ago thought it looked outright bad but then when analyze this finally opened few days ago an odd thing happened it got great reviews critics were proclaiming it hilarious and dead on parody of mob movies well with praise like that figured it must be good and so headed off to the theater you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts well turns out that expression is more valid than ever gave it credit for analyze this is slow unfunny and badly acted don get me wrong think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century but he is just out of his league here think the problem is he didn quite know how to approach this material he plays his character mob boss paull vitti somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama if he had played the character straight along the lines of leslie nielson in the naked gun series he probably would have been lot more successful as it is though he plays the character completely serious at some moments and for laughs at others this doesn work it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold you always know it him and the movie is badly paced too it never takes off it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum think the blame for this should be placed on the script it obvious the writer had good idea for movie mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of psychiatrist but once this is established the movie doesn really go anywhere the formula of the film seems to be this billy crystal says no to deniro deniro forces him and much wackiness ensues this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie ve said it before and ll say it again the only thing that matters to me in comedy is whether or not it funny if analyze this had been funny the pacing and bad acting wouldn have bothered me would have been too busy laughing to notice but as it is only chuckled few times the only really funny scene is dead on parody of the godfather sadly though don think anyone in the audience saw it with realized it was parody because was the only one laughing but my sense of humour have come to realize is vastly different from the general population loathed there something about mary yet loved baseketball now if you want movie that think is funny go out and see office space it full of genuine laughs and won leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes as analyze this did
jean claude van damme movies tend to be if nothing else lot of mindless fun his latest film knock off skips on the fun part leaving wildly incoherent exercise that is well simply mindless you can really blame van damme no one suspect has ever expected the muscles from brussels to contribute heartfelt performance brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray and even his sidekick co star saturday night live alumnus rob makin copies schneider does what expected of him although neither appear to want the role of straight man no the problem with the film is its direction the first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible and it goes downhill from there five hundred characters it seems are introduced within the first fifteen minutes van damme doesn land his first kick until after thirty too late for most action fans and by the time the hour mark has rolled around your jaw will be on your cup holder and you ll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars on this mess director hark tsui whose previous film was the van damme dennis rodman teamed double team films at such frenetic pace that it hard to know what going on who on whose side and what the point of all this is faster than you can yell fruit stand we re watching crazed rickshaw race with schneider being bounced along by an energetic van damme when schneider starts whacking van damme in the behind with four foot eel while enthusing move your beautiful big ass the movie takes an unprecedented turn to the bizarre every now and again knock off will deliver some truly ingenious directorial flourishes inventive camera shots and angles wild rides down gun silencers and from the tops of buildings to the sprawling street below revealing cut ins within the frame but they all happen too quickly and within such furious frame of reference that they re wasted if only hark could have slowed things down just for minute if you re interested in the plot you re better off reading capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from the on screen shenanigans jean claude van damme plays shady bluejeans manufacturer who uncovers russian mafia plot to terrorize the world with nanobombs hidden in cabbage patch knock offs maybe with paul sorvino more accurate summary would be jean claude van damme bums around hong kong failing to avoid large blatant coca cola product placements the fact that the film is staged during hong kong last days under british rule gets some lip service but doesn figure in at all perhaps knock off most intriguing credit is that ron and russell mael composed the frenzied music score some of you might remember the mael brothers as the 80s synth pop duo sparks their contributions here are as confused as the accompanying action kimono my house indeed like the cheap jeans and pumma sneakers manufactured in hong kong van damme latest is real phony

there was probably good reason that the warner bros studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened and after seeing this piece of toxic waste now know why this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago fire down below centers its story on little mining town in god country somewhere in eastern kentucky it beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate kris kristopherson who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role it turns out that he filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for tidy profit seagal plays jack taggert an aikido versed fighting machine who is an agent with the epa no not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa it the environmental protection agency had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice written by someone named jeb could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships banjo picking preachers and dumb as nails rednecks but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in seagal idea of disguise is long length $1000 leather jacket but to get closer to the kinfolk he will fix people porches for free that another great epa asset teaching agents how to fix porches slow and plodding this project is total mess the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige here his bravado basically turns into bullyness townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever and his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of sunday church ceremony gets behind the pulpit and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping kristopherson meets up with seagal kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away seagal gallantly replies ll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and show of fireworks in the background this is truly nothing more than pompous showcase for seagal righteousness and narcissistic arrogance seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring new genre into the filmplace that of the enviro thriller on deadly ground however the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this still believe in preserving mother earth so save your $5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity
tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers all searching for deeper meaning however they won find much meaning in the real blonde and not enough real humor either joe matthew modine is struggling actor or he claims to be one even though he has no credits under his belt his girlfriend mary catherine keener has no pretensions about her career she makeup artist working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair marlo thomas and supermodel of the month sahara bridgette wilson sahara who has acquired new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid has an on again off again relationship with joe best friend bob maxwell caulfield however bob has gotten his biggest break yet starring role on soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly daryl hannah who may be that illusive woman he always pursued real blonde there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde but not enough the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background such as sahara perfume ads depression it not just state of mind but to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in barrel and unfortunately the film forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic take for example the film framing device of an old lady and her dog the story serves absolutely no purpose makes little sense and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film but they re stuck in the most boring plotlines modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley who appears as another struggling actor keener character has stronger edge but the insult self defense class taught by denis leary no less she is stuck in makes little sense the movie running time is under two hours but it seems like it is well over it there just not enough humor to speed things along and not enough meaning to propel any drama
the ads for batman and robin scream the event of the summer is here and that the problem the producers were apparently so intent on creating spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it batman and robin is 126 minutes of lavish sets flashy costumes and big confusing fight scenes with barely hint of substance it like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows bright busy and visually diverting but not very much fun it wasn always this way tim burton batman was an epic story of obsession and duality of darkness and revenge the film while far from perfect was striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel batman was creepy brooding creature of the night the joker brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson was at once charismatic and repellent batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin battling inner demons and one another over gotham city breathtaking gothic skyline those days of the dark knight are gone replaced by psychedelic ice capades run amuck batman and robin has far more in common with the campy 60 batman tv show than with tim burton tale of darkness the blame lies with director joel schumacher former window dresser schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes unfortunately when it comes time to have those people walk and talk he hasn the faintest notion of what to do batman and robin is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it often difficult to tell who whacking who while the characters flail at each other one liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of film batman and robin doesn merely lose momentum it stalls out completely on several occasions it rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one ironically the parts of batman and robin that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne easily the best batman yet clooney expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character sense of depth that the script doesn even hint at the film most effective scene is tender quiet exchange between clooney and alfred michael gough bruce wayne butler and surrogate father as for the other heroes chris donnell robin is enthusiastic perky and horny as hell while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl in movie filled to the brim with major characters the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne girlfriend is puzzling suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built in nipples shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight of course the real stars of batman film are the villains and that where batman and robin really suffers as mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years spitting out stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion laboring under ton of appliances schwarzenegger looks as if he having trouble even moving in his suit let alone trying to act uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy she overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character it apparently rule in the batman series that before person becomes villain he must be cartoonish bumbling nerd once thurman transforms into the eco psychotic poison ivy she does nice mae west impersonation as classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with kiss thurman fails to maintain the character maniacal sense of style though and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film the biggest lesson to be learned from batman and robin is that more is not better joel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what trifle the film really is some critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam don think so my prescription fire joel schumacher but offer him ticket to rubber fetishist convention so he ll understand that there no hard feelings give alicia silverstone her walking papers while keeping clooney donnell and michael gough call jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman then ditch the campiness and for the love of pete lose the event mentality and make movie instead of spectacle next time
gordy is not movie it is 90 minute long sesame street skit and very bad one at that this movie is so stupid and dumb that it depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light and even more surprising is the fact that this is disney movie sure children are the target audience of this movie but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it it is the story of farm piglet named gordy voiced by garms whose family has been taken away to up north which we know means death of course we can hear the animals talk to each other and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible actually it almost funny in way the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears little girl named jinnie sue macallister young who sees gordy on the back of truck and essentially steals him jinnie is country singer and the film goes off on huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it what is the point of this maybe she is one of the producer relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something we then cut to huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce roescher who is sad because his divorced mother is dating he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue but he accidentally falls in pool probably because he was sitting on the diving board with $200 suit on nah didn see that one coming starts to drown and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him if this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of food processing corporation when hank grandfather the original ceo dies and leaves his fortune to hank and gordy of course there must be villain but even this villain donadio as sipes isn that evil he never raises his voice or becomes angry and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story it hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is family film or if the filmmaker are just this untalented and stupid at times gordy is tolerable to watch thus earning it one star and not the dreaded but it just so unbelievably boring cliche dumb unfunny corny and just plain bad it may scare children it certainly disturbed me 21 96 29 97 13 97 [see also babe
senseless marlon wayans is very talented physical comedian and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life alas moments are simply that moments which are not enough to lift this fantasy comedy above its one joke premise granted that one joke is initially amusing when wayans darryl witherspoon an economics major at stratford university hits some dire financial straits he becomes guinea pig for experimental drug that heightens all five senses after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land position at highly esteemed corporate firm at this point the film sounds more like senseful than senseless but through some turns of the plot darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once essentially leaving him yes senseless this sets up some showcase moments for wayans gift for physical comedy especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely hilariously limp but these gags and the gag behind the entire movie quickly grows stale once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses instead of exploring any new comic territory director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness wayans approaches each go round with gusto but by this point he simply treading water for the rest of the film unfunny duration senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn strive to be anything more than comic trifle however the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in blanket of bogus sincerity darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash strapped family and this serious angle seems to come from an entirely different movie unlike wayans last starring vehicle the surprisingly effective and serious the 6th man the emotional content of senseless is forced and unconvincing any attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles darryl romance with janice tamara taylor young woman who yearns for man who is true to himself does not generate sparks of any kind once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros comes to an end the genuinely funny marlon wayans has promising big screen future ahead of him but if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless his film career could go the way of his once promising older brother damon who is now set to make his comeback on television
slight romantic comedy with feminist bent but one with no edge to it it turns out to be conventional film filled with the usual clich and stock characters of this genre though it well written and well acted fluff piece it still does not have too much to say that is surprising it made for the gentle art house set those who don want something too disturbing to think about it about critically successful writer husband alec pryce who is so self absorbed that he threatened by his department store floor walking model wife kate bouquet who wants to be writer she meets his crass publisher vanni corso walken another self absorbed man and predictable relationship occurs the fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet she now wants her own identity and her independence the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for tv movie the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax it set in london and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by wealthy american shopper vanni she later meets him as her hubby new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as publisher of quality and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel alec who is an obnoxious grouse someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book published which only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni the publisher is proud that he mamma boy who never married and is self made man who has earned millions he has recently acquired failing old london publishing house and plans to revitalize it as he proudly tells kate if my father could sell pizzas in harlem could sell culture in europe the only thing that couldn be sold is this stiff story and tired plot line the mystery to me is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy she soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soon to become beleaguered vanni when she writes second novel he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one as its story of ambition and lust winds down in whimper business affair was loosely based on the real life literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly in their celebrated 1950s love triangle
if you re the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn butter optional then this is the movie for you indeed this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip offs of other recent action movies or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them it difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film but at least we re warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show what are the four ingredients of really bad action movie first the movie gives us an introductory premise huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor and in this area many ships have disappeared oooh scary secondly cheesy soundtrack tries to connote tone of mystery but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score third the main character is mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo treat williams he operates sophisticated military style pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy finally in the cargo hold we see those that hired him they are also mercenaries that have tough looking haircuts talk with accents and try to show how macho they are during their trip across the stormy sea their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs spotting cruise ship in the distance they make their way to the ocean liner and devise plan to raid the machine shop take the parts that they need and then continue on their merry way little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster yet they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in matter of seconds this is nothing more than by the book action film their realization of the situation that they re in doesn happen until they are in the bowels of the boat those who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed the corridors on the ship are narrow misty and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare fests must have yet despite the predictable nature of this film there are some scary boo moments but most of it is just outright silly and this film is unusually gory too monsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains there is one particularly neat scene where monster has been cut apart and reveals victim that is still alive he screams horribly as the monster digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away additionally it borrows heavily from speed2 alien and bunch of other recent films the mercenaries even run into lone surviving passenger femke jannsen who looks amazingly like sandra bullock to be honest when left the theatre just had to laugh at how witless the film was it moronic fun at best so if you re hankering for large bucket of popcorn served with side of silliness then this might just hit the spot
synopsis when meteorite crashlands in the arizona desert community college professors ira kane duchovny and harry block jones are first on the scene they discover that an alien lifeform has arisen from the rock and is evolving at an amazing rate soon the army advised by dr allison reed moore moves in and forces kane and block out but when the aliens begin to menace society it may take the scientists combined efforts to stop them before they terminate the evolution of another lifeform humanity review evolution certainly has the ingredients for decent comedy it directed by reitman clearly trying to parlay his ghostbusters success into twenty first century counterpart it stars duchovny and although one might question his judgment in lampooning his files character so soon after leaving the tv series it should certainly provide him with plenty of ammunition and then there moore who may not have much prior experience in comedy but who has certainly proven her ability as an actress shame then that it all deteriorates into such hopelessly unfunny morass evolution is movie more concerned with its special effects which are quite good than anything resembling consistently funny script it has its moments scene in which jones body is invaded by an alien is particularly entertaining but there are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour moore is totally wasted her clumsy shtick getting very old very fast duchovny has stunningly little in the way of material to work with and the story is so formulaic it could have been written by monkeys part of what made ghostbusters so wonderful was combination of great script and characters the audience could root for evolution is so mind numbingly tedious that it difficult not to start cheering for the aliens
this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney live action george of the jungle tarzan and the lost city the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough legendary hero to the big screen is one of the most inept and ill timed of any tarzan adventure so far badly conceived and poorly executed tarzan and the lost city appears headed for quick trip to video store shelves have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan it not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie furthermore it even more curious that this film is rated pg which by definition rules out any sex or explicit violence and while not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story tarzan deserves slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production of course no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city since the film troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line imagine george of the jungle stripped of all intentional humor and you have fair idea of what this tarzan is like with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences the film barely registers pulse anyone in search of relatively entertaining family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book which uses the same basic elements to much better effect the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery which unfortunately includes the two lead actors the film doesn attempt to re tell the origin story the thinking is that it has been done often enough instead tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke john clayton tarzan the ape man casper van dien several days before his marriage to lady jane porter jane march he is living happily in england enjoying the benefits of being land owning noble meanwhile in central africa the dastardly nigel ravens steven waddington self proclaimed scholar and explorer believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar which he calls the cradle of civilization on the way there he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things like burning native villages to earn the wrath of the locals one shaman determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal sends mystical message to tarzan for help with lady jane following close behind he returns to the jungle where he was born its patently obvious that casper van dien one of the pretty boy heroes of starship troopers was not hired on the basis of his acting ability with his plastic facial expressions monotone voice and complete inability to make convincing animal noises his range rivals that of steven seagal his pecs however are impressive and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off jane march on the other hand has to keep her shirt on which may be first for her some six years ago march give solid performance in jean jacques annaud steamy the lover since then she made the career killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night which exploited her every acting defiency tarzan continues this trend march may be attractive but at least judging by this performance she can act meanwhile steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be really detestable bad guy instead he turns out to be little more than nuisance the story line is pure formula which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies the problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless the romantic elements are all contrived in fact lady jane presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance the special effects are truly bottom of the barrel including some laughably bad men in ape costumes apparently animatronics were too expensive for this production and of course as with all jungle movies there are the obligatory cute animals over the years the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material the most famous ape man was johnny weismuller but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part including gordon scott who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role weismuller made 12 tarzan features van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number and having seen tarzan and the lost city would argue that the movie going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12
desperate measures is generic title for film that beyond generic it also depressing waste of talent with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles not to mention once cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not cool flicks this thriller is more before and after than reversal of fortune the movie is big disappointment and yet it somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it the premise is both promising and intriguing too bad the execution all wrong though because the set up of desperate measures boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use san francisco cop frank connor garcia is single parent with troubling dilemma his son matt joseph cross is stricken with cancer which only bone marrow transplant can push into remission even worse the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe michael keaton currently serving life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery he at first reluctant but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital when he does make run for it connor offers close pursuit but for different reasons than his superiors including the crusty brian cox they want to take mccabe down while connor needs to keep him alive or all hope is lost for his little boy one misstep desperate measures makes is in its underdevelopment of matt illness what needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just little too hard to swallow take for example scene where mccabe is trying to make getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him and what does connor do he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son whatever to be fair though the lack of story background is the least of the movie problems first and foremost is how cheaply desperate measures trades the potential of it opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour once mccabe escapes the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab hostage and get away also the movie is so intent on giving you hoot inducing lip smacking villain the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter natch that it completely casts garcia frank connor by the dullsville wayside desperate measures appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist and the movie head scratcher of send off confirms this there is some good to be found amongst this mess particularly in the acting department cast against type michael keaton understated menace is highly effective although he not given much believable to work with andy garcia plays off taut emotional chord joseph cross as garicia ailing son is surprisingly unsentimental and marcia gay harden lends solid support as doctor who becomes major player in the unfolding chaos this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending but most is lost it goes without saying that desperate measures needs an operation of its very own

ever watch very young child try and tell joke that is beyond his or her sophistication it full of stops and starts and usually the punch line is ruined felt the same way watching drowning mona skip stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy there are some slightly successful attempts at humor but they only serve as window dressing there is running gag about the town verplanck being test town for the then new yugo everyone drives yugo differentiating their cars with personalized license plates even the police chief drives one there is certain sublimeness to the image of lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets there also is running gag about one of the characters jeff missing hand and how it occurred it pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends it turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend there are some sight gags that pop up as well such as mona tombstone which reads demoted instead of devoted still the core of the story maintains the flatness of still pond the lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona midler each scene with her is the same scream at someone hit someone then scream some more there no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness anyone off the street could have played the role such as it is the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts each one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization there is burly female car mechanic so of course there is forced lesbianism gag mona son jeff marcus thomas is simpleton hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth chief of police rash devito likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter there nothing more to him elle the chief daughter campbell is bland personified dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have child and be married mona husband phil fichtner jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch bob affleck elle betrothed and business partner to jeff is mumbling obvious dullard there is no contrast to any of the characters by having at least one character with some wit or wits to serve as counterpoint to the others perhaps steinfeld attempt at satirizing small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better ostensibly murder mystery drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer who could be anyone due to mona loving manner with everyone on town even that aspect of the film fails throwing in convenient ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things it been while since walked away from movie theater in an angry mood what makes it all the more remarkable is that rarely remember comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it ineptitude
what are we going to do with jim carrey viewers of television in living color know this one man cartoon from such characters as fire marshall bill viewers also know that in living color is skit show and that little of jim carrey goes long way unfortunately this fact was forgotten by the makers of the carrey comedy ace ventura pet detective three writers including carrey worked on the slapstick story which sends self styled pet detective on the trail of stolen dolphin the missing mammal belongs to the miami dolphins who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl for plot porpoises this story works as well as any three stooges short carrey gets to do his official schtick as he snoops around greater miami he leers and sneers craning his neck to funny effect he even does his captain kirk impersonation again all of this is pretty harmless stuff up until the point that you realize that the writers have absolutely no intention of focusing on anyone other than carrey suggested alternate title jim carrey will do anything for laugh export it to france and you may have hit as it stands ace ventura isn even good kid stuff the profanity count alone is too high which is ironic since children are probably carrey best audience the film doesn even have the goofball charm of chris elliott recent no brainer cabin boy sure carrey has his moments but what can you say about film whose high points include watching carrey slink around to the theme from mission impossible ace ventura has one glaring incongruity amid the butt jokes and double takes the script takes great pains to set up an elaborate and rather funny crying game gag and for this intended audience that takes ahem cojones
there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space it just that none of them happen to be actors the stars referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie outer space the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home yes in terms of acting the star power is well more like falling star kinda pretty short lived and pretty much dead lost in space as if you really didn know is based on the 60 sci fi television series of the same name it the year 2058 and earth precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population john robinson william hurt is the scientist leading mission program to colonize foreign planet earth entire existance is contingent upon successful mission but nobody whether it be john family or hired battle pilot don west matt leblanc seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years john family consists of his wife maureen mimi rogers his atypical teenage daughter penny lacey chabert his ingenious son will jack johnson and his beautiful scientist daughter judy heather graham despite everyone reluctance the jupiter spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space unknown to anyone but the audience there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission dr smith gary oldman has been hired by group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour and dr smith has re programmed talking robot to destroy robinson family when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination and now the premise of being lost in space is complete as for the audience you will likely be lost in boredom by this point wondering if the plot like the jupiter will ever get off the ground it hard to tell who deserves the most blame the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script chabert is basically the only one to overdo it sounding like whiny munchkin on helium if you like me were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens you re wrong that just her normal voice in yet another example of friend faltering on the big screen leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming make sense it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod graham is babe thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film hurt the siyah hole of excitement sucks up any energy that might have been left if hurt were available in tablet form he would be prescription strength sleeping pill johnson isn dull he just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody ass all the time want an example of how cool this kid can be how about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family hey don laugh the thing actually listened to the mr rogers would be proud sentiment but alas if you thought character couldn be much worse there was rogers as the epitome of generic or mother as she was known why hire an actress they could ve had beyaz cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it now that would ve had some pizzazz lost in space luckily doesn suffer in every single category that it could have the special effects are crisp clear and at least mildly captivating unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman who plays his evil character with great deal of fun and finesse unfortunately oldman is locked away for most of the film giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy while the special effects are pleasing to the eye they are nothing you couldn find in most modern sci fi films contact for example far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered work of cinematic art with numerous contradictions the time travel aspect was horribly flawed wooden and corny acting worse dialogue and an ending so disappointing you be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens then again with an ending like this film has it obvious sequel is already being considered what an awful note to end on knowing there could be more of this in year or two the attempt to be family oriented is commendable but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups well danger potential movie goers danger this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity
so it thirty years later and oscar and felix are together again that might have been an exciting notion if it wasn for the fact that the odd couple of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies 1993 grumpy old men 1995 grumpier old men and 1997 out to sea grumpiest old men so the odd couple ii the grumpiest old men of all really seems just another entry in tired series the plot is even similar to that of grumpy old men in that lemmon and matthau mismatched characters are brought together by romance between their children oscar son jonathan silverman and felix daughter lisa waltz are getting married and former roommates felix ungar lemmon and oscar madison matthau meet at the airport and decide to share car then hilarity ensues well few chuckles ensue anyway neil simon the award winning playwright who created oscar and felix provides the screenplay which is shock because the script is piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end unlike the original play movie odd couple ii doesn find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters instead it depends upon series of humorous situations oscar and felix lose the car over cliff are caught smuggling mexicans over the border take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands the women are played by christine baranski of cybill and jean smart of designing women and hitch ride with man who dies in the desert the original 1968 movie the odd couple remains classic comedy it introduced the motif of roommate as spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since it was the second outing for the lemmon matthau team which debuted in 1966 the fortune cookie and they made couple more worthwhile comedies the front page 1974 and buddy buddy 1981 before going their separate ways the reunion of lemmon and matthau in grumpy old men six years ago was delightful and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie but out to sea and the odd couple ii are just beating grumpy old horse you can add lemmon my fellow americans grumpy old presidents to that list too let hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do let hope also that we see neil simon name on movies that do it justice this is his first since 1993 lost in yonkers
except for few bright moments of good verbal comedy that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through bette midler and dennis farina play lilly and dan actress and author once married now violently divorced and back together one last time for their daughter molly paula marshall wedding lilly and dan hate each other passionately so passionately that they have sex at the wedding and fall in love again each ditches his or her current spouse of 14 years and runs off with the other molly married now only 24 hours runs off in search of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith jamie denton tries to console the abandoned spouses in molly search for her parents she somehow falls in love with lilly paparazzo joey danny nucci meanwhile the newlywed keith ends up consoling dan wife rowena gail grady in bed the audience saw this with apparently thought that all the adultery was hilarious no dan quayle but thought it was bit creepy the message seemed to be ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and have fun fucking who you wish family values aside there something cruel about all this perhaps this movie would have played well as siyah comedy but the movie is romantic comedy we are supposed to be rooting for these creeps reiner and screenwriter leslie dixon tried to make it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable lilly husband is new age flake who rambles about emotional valet parking so we can write him off as irrelevant dan wife is vain manipulative and jealous so we can write her off as bitch molly husband is career conscious self centered republican politician who thinks she too fat and just for good measure he also fucked dan wife so we can write him off as prick everyone else falls in love but still that somehow doesn justify the actions of the movie main characters he prick or she bitch is no defense the movie is somewhat redeemed by some funny dialog often during heated arguments and by above average performances by midler and farina breaking out of his character actor mold other than that it standard romantic comedy with very substandard gimmick
maybe this mission should have been scrubbed mission to mars film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman there world of difference between artists and technicians the artist has vision to create something new he may not do it well it might be sloppy but it something you ve never seen before good technician can make it look good but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else it going to be just xerox obviously successful films need both skills brian de palma is masterful technician he spent his career copying others most notably hitchcock he usually knows exactly what to do to make scene work but only because he has learned it by rote aside from rare flashes of originality his films are often soul dead in de palma latest he turns his attention to stanley kubrick to tell the truth enjoyed portions of this movie but liked it lot better over 30 years ago when it was called 2001 enjoyed it even more when it was titled close encounters nasa has set its sights for mars when the first crew meets with disaster rescue mission is sent to the kirmizi planet they don do so well either but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut gone rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe and it all so boring there are so many scenes that just don work it difficult to begin when the first crew is few feet away from raging massive upside down martian tornado which looks remarkably like sandworm from dune destroying everything in its path they just hang out watching error the most interesting character and that not saying much is killed off error the alien is laughable error the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable error there some nice eyecandy the face on mars which turns out to be giant metal thai buddha head looks cool three dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic but there so much more that feels as if we ve been there before from 2001 there the rotating space station the blinding beyaz room >from close encounters they solve sound puzzle and play it to the aliens the list goes on the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues even gary sinise and tim robbins can muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing no one seems to care about anything that happens you won either the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr pepper with 20 foot tall logo saves the day they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film
mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival it may not be clear to the viewer why am so negative on this film for most of the running time in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry toward the end of the film think everything that has been built falls apart the film was to be pilot for tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it something else is what he did the film opens with woman played by laura harring about to be killed in car when car crash saves her life she crawls away from the accident with concussion and finds herself bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep meanwhile young vivacious betty naomi watts arrives in hollywood from canada she wants to build career as an actress betty is little surprised to find woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow she does not know who the woman is she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is they fix on name rita for her but are not sure if this right or not meanwhile local director adam kesher justin theroux has problems of his own he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else cammie rhodes melissa george these two threads are joined by third one in which there is strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong there is also strange character called the cowboy monty montgomery adding to the confusion in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits lot of mulholland drive starts out fun lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film he just chooses not to as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason there are no earthworms but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches the film is little long for the subject matter toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes clearly not intended for the tv pilot unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers will not mention them in the main body of the review but give mulholland drive on the to 10 scale and low on the to +4 scale mulholland drive spoiler warning have rated this film fairly low you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film david lynch is in large part dark satirist most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside in mulholland drive think he is having laugh at the expense of the crime film genre what he does with this film is are you sure you want to read this playing off the audience expectations that there will be simple explanation for what is going on the first 80% of the film he tells simple multi thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something the audience expectation is that they will add up but he has given clues that are self contradictory lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories in fact the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until hear better explanation think lynch is merely playing joke there is visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties mad magazine called it poiuyt other sources called it tri pronged bar look at small portions of it and makes sense look at the whole figure and it does not this film is in my estimation the cinematic equivalent of tri pronged bar
ingredients possessed plastic dolls in love plastic dolls having sex starring jennifer tilly voice of brad dourif katherine heigl nick stabile john ritter synopsis this is the fourth film in the chucky series which debuted in the late 1980s basically chucky is plastic doll that can walk and talk because it is possessed by the spirit of slain murderer in bride of chucky chucky longtime girlfriend tiffany jennifer tilly dies and her spirit inhabits female plastic doll through voodoo dolls tiffany and chucky get married and embark on quest to reach cemetery in new jersey where mystical gem might enable them to be humans the dolls stow away in the back of vehicle driven by newly eloped couple so in the side plot the couple suspects each other of being murderer opinion bride of chucky is an attempt at horror with humor but doesn succeed somehow chucky moaning about mid life crisis and how he should have gotten married does not make for very scary chucky and tiffany harping about mid life crisis and how she should have gotten married does not make for very scary tiffany the suspenseless bride of chucky relies mostly on jennifer tilly cleavage to keep attention during the first half and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second half the best that can be said about bride of chucky is that it is sarcastic
watching the movie vowed to subtract half star from the review because the filmmakers included saccharine syrup cute cuddly computer generated monkey if the monkey died the movie got an extra half star alas the monkey showed up at the end unharmed to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs what that means is that lost in space actually deserved stars that pretty generous considering the movie camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek when will robinson jack johnson teaches his pet robot about friendship you are actually supposed to buy it so why such seemingly high rating there are few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage first we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of brand new theater the sound and screen kicked ass nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did and don necessarily mean that in good way also there were more than zero scenes where found myself rooting for the robinsons or getting caught up in the movie tension even liked the computer generated settings usually prefer to see models or sets but the cg was more detailed than ve seen in lot of movies it looks like someone spent little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities also gary oldman is never bad actor even though he is typecast as villain william hurt isn too bad either neither actor had great role but their performances were watchable and perhaps shouldn admit this but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood there is very little swearing or blood there is strong moral message saccharine though it is there is bit of romance whose culmination after hours is real kiss no sex it felt like one of those disney movies that so looked forward to when was six those movies were probably as bad as lost in space but at the time they were manna from heaven that type of moviemaking is lost art now for the bad news worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue it squeaky clean family fun trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction you better hold on to your joystick is one such line and when robinson is called upon to deliver line about warp conduit thingamajigs they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign second worst and closely related is the screenplay the story exposition takes place at press conference which allows the writers to explain what happening with the least amount of creativity effort or interest once the story gets going do concede momentary burst of interest once in while but on the whole the situations that arise are silly and contrived when gary oldman easily reprograms will pet robot to kill the robinsons my friend summed it up perfectly he flipped the switch to evil then there the tone of the movie the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson then it could be an adventure movie they re mostly right except that johnson will wasn good enough actor to carry it off still that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows lack of imagination just because movie is tame enough for kids doesn mean that we have to bow to promise keepers notion of who the center of family many quality family films have been made with non traditional family structure fly away home comes to mind to much better effect and the politics of the time seem bit conservative and regressive for futuristic movie in star wars the rebels were the good guys we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system in lost in space the rebels are the bad guys terrorist force that must be killed crushed and silenced so that our children may live free that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists finally few specific details deserve criticism the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 why why bother saying what year this is just tell us it the future bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 setting specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won be timeless not that this movie was really in the running anyway then there is scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on chair that rises about fifteen feet on pole this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny barber chair and only shows that the future is time when spaceship designers haven learned thing about ergonomics one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed it made lost in space look cool the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and out of context made it sound hip this is overlaid on cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie but if that the best part of the movie can in good conscience recommend it still if you get stuck seeing it as we did you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance think of liking bad movies as child and bring along your bad movie bingo cards
was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night but before that stopped into my video store to rent some movies luckily my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta knew it was going to be bad print with only half faces and poor sound quality but couldn help myself got it well after watching it it indeed was bad print was glad didn dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in bad theatre watching bad movie this movie really sucks it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy for example how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail the songs are bad the acting is bad especially deepti bhatnagar and the direction is the worst of all the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up didn even finish the movie couldn take it anymore note but if anyone out there liked aatish by the same director guess you like this movie it practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff aditya panscholi is the sidekick again was going to give it zero but personally like jackie shroff so loosened up little he looked fresh wore good clothes as always and his performance even though it wasn his best was the only saving grace of the movie
capsule one of the ten worst movies ever made christopher lambert vs evil ninjas in modern day japan and nobody wins the hunted is such bad movie so completely inept and so totally brain damaged that could almost feel affection for it could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting good jolly guffaw out of it if it weren also insanely xenophobic and insulting christopher lambert plays computer parts salesman who on business in japan he meets slinky young woman joan chen and has torrid night of lovemaking with her and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader john lone apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered since lambert is witness he of course the next one to die let stop and think about this for second if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to ninja secret society he have lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock in this movie the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body you know what goof field is that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes klutz no matter what their real dexterity is this is of course only the beginning of the movie problems lambert eventually finds pseudo safety with long haired modern day samurai yoshio harada and his partner yoko shimada who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun they are the two best things in the movie in every scene they have authority and presence and they actually look like they belong here even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows the script doesn know what the hell to do with them lone as the bad guy is zero dimensional the only bad guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him in the hunted this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype what funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes there nice little scene with tokyo cabdriver and girl in pachinko parlor but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful also the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled superior soundtrack get the cd that manages to survive despite the drek it been designed to accompany there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing gory excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for moment and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re couple the whole thing with the movie relentlessly stupid plot by the time we get to the final showdown with lambert getting to wield his own sword which judging from the ham handed editing of one scene was forged in seven hours or so we no longer care we re not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies someone once said that the key to good art good movies good books whatever is to start somewhere interesting end up somewhere interesting and show respect for the audience all along the way this movie bungles two out of three badly
hello kids today the movie studios want to take over my critical review and somehow persuade you that _armageddon_ the summer biggest blockbuster is film for everybody and remember if film is for _everybody_ and if it makes the most money for the summer it _must_ be good right armageddon is comedy with capital it stars bruce willis who has hundred one liners it has tiny rock land directly in the middle of heated argument in new york city and chuckle chuckle one of those new yorkers _survives_ with charcoal all over his face snorkle sniff hiccup and it has steve buscemi as _genius_ who wants to work for an oil rig knee slap isn this just so so funny armageddon also has romance with capital it has tender moment between forbidden lovers ben affleck and liv tyler with with animal crackers and it has will patton as long lost husband trying to reunite with his separated wife and child who thinks he salesman gurgle sniff awwwww and it has steve buscemi spewing more one liners about minors and strippers umm moving right along armageddon also has lots of action with capital not just any action sequence would do it must have _original_ action sequences that are designed to thrill like drill darn it drill and let have inept people destroy the mir space station can you hear your heart beating and steve buscemi goes crazy and starts shooting at people what drama lastly armageddon is out there to save the planet with capital this can be any old thriller we must have an asteroid the size of texas head straight for earth and and we must have beautiful scenic worldwide shots like paris blown up and and we must have peoples of all colors nations and religions join hand in hand for one final hopeful hug the final sequence where muslims in prostrate worship stand up in domino fashion to cheer the victory filled me with such emotional goo that wanted to to to rip the screen into shreds mean mean cheer for ecstatic joy it was over comedy romance action planet okay kids what does that spell seriously folks any film that could take the indie films most valuable talents and throw it all away with bruce willis vehicle hundred million dollar budget but have cheap sets and lousy special effects is bottom line living proof that hell exists and has made multi picture deal with universal in the midst of all the action the terseness the one liners the fake sets the overall waste of time recognized matt malloy playing an underwritten nasa technician malloy give me reading remember him he was principal player in last year _in the company of men_ film that was more powerful shocking terrifying funny and shocking than _armageddon_ could ever aspire to be _armageddon_ cost over $100 million to make _itcom_ cost paltry $30 000 need say more
deserves recognition for achieving the near impossible task of making grander monument to self love than steven seagal on deadly ground capsule review question after the floating baby ruth that was waterworld what in the @$&% were the hollywood execs who gave kevin costner the money to make another post apocalyptic movie thinking in this hour advertisement for his new hair weave costner plays nameless drifter who dons long dead postal employee uniform and gradually turns nuked out usa into an idealized hippy dippy society judging by the costuming at the end of the movie the main accomplishment of this brave new world is in re inventing polyester when he not pointing the camera directly at himself director costner does have nice visual sense and it is undeniably fascinating to see such an unabashedly jingoistic film in the trust no one 90 but by the time the second hour rolled around was reduced to sitting on my hands to keep from clawing out my own eyes mark this one return to sender
starring ben stiller elizabeth hurley maria bello janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz permanent midnight is pretty bad movie though it took me few days to conclude this the film is more masturbatory than bleak with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity he has $6000 week drug habit ultimately as adapted by veloz jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve you are less mystified by his self destructive nature than bored into stupor yourself ben stiller plays stahl young author who arrives in with ambition and nasty drug habit he eventually gets gig for $5000 week writing for sitcom called mr chompers thinly veiled stand in for alf chompers looks just like alf except he mavi marries producer hurley so she can get green card and hooks up with spanish mother liz torres who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons insert proverbial downward spiral here permanent midnight is structured mostly as flashback with recovering addict bello meeting stiller at fastfood restaurant where stiller works the drive thru as part of rehab taking him back to hotel and between bouts of serious screwing listening to his life story ve spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive worse ve been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive as stahl stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect post there something about mary of either the actor or comedy writer what separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk junkies it seems is that stahl wrote book about his idiocy watch stahl shoot heroin next to baby watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack fueled babble stiller gives technically flawless performance the film could double as documentary on how to be junkie but permanent midnight is mostly soulless when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved and then answers it in the form of bello character basically shrink in siyah panties could person care less in the film version of his autobiography of the same name stahl doesn need saving he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie it that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood types known to man stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs is this hollywood california learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead of course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems so basically his drug habit got him book deal movie based on his life and now he apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects so much for the moral of that story temporary midnight is more like it bill chambers september 1998
the camera zooms in incredibly close it focuses on the closed eyes of person presumed dead all of sudden with thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse his eyelids open the camera zooms in incredibly close it focuses on one of the characters desperately running for her life then with thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse she bumps into the killer the camera zooms in incredibly close it focuses on door from where seemingly strange sounds emanate all of sudden with thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse the doors swing open to reveal what inside close up thrill shots such as these seemed to elicit more laughter from the audience rather than genuine fear which is pretty good sign that you re not watching the thriller that the director had originally envisioned rather you adopt the opinion that the characters are so goofy and so unaware of the trouble that they re in that you stop caring about who lives who dies and where the story goes instead you become more interested in how the characters get killed off the four young teenagers who are the potential sacrificial lambs for this movie are helen and barry and julie and ray two couples and dear friends to one another during the summer just after high school graduation they take fateful drive down dark mountain highway suddenly without warning their car hits someone whom the teens presume was killed as result of that collision fearing jail time and possible manslaughter charges if they confess they instead decide to dump the body into the ocean and make pact never to discuss the episode again year goes by and things among the four friends begin to change relationships fizzle future dreams crumble and attitudes change but they can not forget what they did and apparently neither can someone else someone begins to send letters to all four of the teens with the frightening message know what you did last summer the letter writer figure in rubber slicker wielding large metal hook soon makes his presence known and begins to hunt down the four teens it now up to the four of them to try to figure out who the killer is before it too late while this movie has some nice visually eerie effects too much of it impact had to be generated with extreme close ups while the level of suspense was choppy at best there is so much more that this movie could have been but decided to give us nothing but cheap thrills it could have been clever whodunit but discovering who ultimately was the killer made me just shrug my shoulders it could have explored the changed friendships after year of adulthood but seemed to only include that aspect to add 15 more minutes to the film it could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime you re alone and you see shadowy figures moving about you don walk towards them yelling hello once you yell hello you can expect an extreme close up thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse it difficult to be in suspense when you know what about to happen the only redeeming aspect of the movie is that now have neat idea for halloween costume but not sure if the local costume store sells rubber slickers and hooks the horror that experienced from this film is realizing that actually went to see it
goodbye lover sat on the shelf for almost year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may and one look will tell you why it mess and that way before ellen degeneres shows up the film is one of those torrid double indemnity crime stories that in this case required the services of three screenwriters suspect that one wrote sexy thriller one wrote murder mystery and one wrote comedy then director roland joff tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment didn laugh at ellen degeneres much think was supposed to degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse tough talking vulgar cop with bad wardrobe and bad hair either degeneres is wearing wig as most of the actors appear to be or she doesn yet have enough clout to secure hairstylist every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip but her incessant wisecracking is poorly written and merely stupid her reaction to the brutal killing of jogger is at least she died healthy and that one of her wittier asides degeneres sgt rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of wait to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triple crosses it best described this way sultry sexpot real estate agent sandra dunmore patricia arquette is married to jake creative yet unfocused and alcoholic advertising rep played by dermot mulroney sandra likes to act out her deep seated sexual fantasies and jake brother ben the suave as ever don johnson likes to help ben is also coming on to his petite mousy co worker peggy blaine mary louise parker and someone somewhere is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again although there are some genuine surprises the plot twists get too contrived too quickly probably around the time degeneres gumcracking gumshoe appears at least the former ellen star is going for something little different arquette turns in yet another of her stiletto heeled platinum blonde bombshell roles see lost highway true romance while quoting embarrassing lines like not wearing any underwear hope she got paid lot of money to do this here an example of some of the film flat out stupidity sandra purchases used car and disguises herself in kirmizi wig prior to stalking two of the film duplicitous lovers she drives the motorbiking couple off cliff while blaring her favorite the sound of music on her car stereo intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims so what was the point of the wig and the car the sound of music stuff might be reference to the wizard of oz allusions in david lynch wild at heart but if so joff must have forgotten that wild at heart was despicable movie it hard to believe that goodbye lover was directed by the same person who made the killing fields and the mission it not however hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long it should have stayed there
as with any gen mtv movie like last year dead man on campus the movie is marketed for primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points sex and football those two items wrapped in guilty pleasure package are sure to snare sizeable box office chunk initially but sales will decline for two reasons first the football sequences are nothing new nor can they be the sports genre isn mainstream and it been retread to death second the sex is just bad despite the appearance of whipped cream bikini or the all night strip club party there nothing even remotely tantalizing the acting is mostly mediocre not including the fantastic jon voight cultivating his usual sliminess voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes twenty two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years this year he plans to make it twenty three unfortunately when his star quarterback lance harbor paul walker goes down for the count he got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon james van der beek moxon leads the team through its last four games and then must cope with his newfound stardom the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie amy smart and other temptations that abound in football crazy west canaan most regions of the country are not nearly as football crazy as texas and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most similarly the set design is wrong for high school setting the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms radio headsets which never seem to work however and instead require coaches to signal plays manually and even giant bronze statue of coach kilmer these elements as well as the heavy drinking and carousing might be more appropriate on college campus but mtv core audience is the high school demographic this focus is further emphasized by the casting james van der beek of tv dawson creek is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero although he never manages to do anything with the role other stars are similarly young and unmemorable there not much that goes right about varsity blues and there not much to like about it either everything herein has already been done and if it hasn the movie manages to botch it one way or another this is certainly missable
nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink and concussive nudge bombast rama con air the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill fated bar room brawl the prison scenes are accompanied by voice overs in which poe in languid southern drawl describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met if the scene gives you tickle of familiarity it probably should cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim witted and ridiculous and that he going to have to do something to keep himself entertained and thus he slips into familiar surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings cage plays cameron poe as buffed up version of raising arizona mcdonnough cage should have known what he was getting himself into he got paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock and if there one thing you can count on from bruckheimer production even without his late partner don simpson it that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage performance in the rock cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time that sense of discovery has been replaced by wry self awareness while the plot of con air finds poe parolee on board hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home cage goal is different but just as simple to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact audiences too should know what they re getting themselves into with bruckheimer production in fact the marketing people are counting on it no one who loathed the rock for its swear grunt blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded director simon west yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab soda fountain delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture it perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing diabetic coma like insulin con air does the work of gland what he doesn deliver is moment of suspense bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk really _really_ big desk and really _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension they might have done something with con air creepiest set up at desert stop for the plane load of convicts serial killer garland greene steve buscemi wanders of into trailer park where he meets little girl having tea party in drained swimming pool their tete tete is eerie and menacing providing welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi chance to stand out in cast with too many villains danny trejo ving rhames and characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them in fact con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement too many characters too much editing too many dopey punch lines too much of the cheap ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack as marshal goes for earnest cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep his recycled raising arizona performance is means of escape his chase after stuffed bunny continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies it doesn bode well for cage appearance in face off later this month perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over there word for people like you nicolas that word is called recidivist repeat offender

it always bad sign when the core audience of film children are either walking out early or are half asleep when the credits roll at the end of film that about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians cold pea soup of cute animals stupid home alone antics boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression indeed walt disney is rolling over in his grave again cursing john hughes name for making the original live action 101 dalmatians one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time and now its sequel the main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor 101 dalmatians the original made more than $100 million dollars at the box office spawned torrid collection of collectible items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal marts across the country and generally made every kid on the planet want damn dalmatian pup for christmas well it been about four years since then and dalmatian fever is coming back and this time it digitally enhanced here the story cruella de vil glenn close is released from prison due to the cure of her puppy homicide urges by one dr pavlov oh how witty she rejoins the world as dog lover and is assigned to probation officer who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film cruella then becomes ella dog lover until the plot twists like dog with his leash caught on the back of moving truck and she becomes the evil vixen again kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula at this point was envying those kids filing out of the theater how low have glenn close and gerard depardieu as the film villain sunk in the film business it almost laughable in sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon and depardieu how can french guy have bad french accent and never mind the toilet brush haircut the only minutely positive selling point can even think to point out is the talking bird with british accent courtesy of eric idle that thinks he rottweiler now that funny
the animal is marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling it clunky and slow like watching an 18 wheeler trying to accelerate up hill there are certainly better things you can do with your time actually if you ve seen the trailer then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments the story centers on bland marvin rob schneider who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be real officer but he afflicted with loser itis dogs attack him neighbors torment him children bully him and his co workers ignore him truthfully with his bad haircut seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic little richard and giant poodles and his unenthusiastic demeanor we probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun this is actually bad because you can like character if you can develop sympathy for him we never do and it may be just as well that he drives off cliff and plummets to the canyon floor however marvin is found by an eccentric doctor michael caton who uses radical and experimental procedure to save him implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs as result marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on body swim with the speed of dolphin and can run as fast as cheetah imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation with his enhanced abilities he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him however the spirit of the film takes raunchy turn and instead marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic sexual urges goats beware he also chases cats urinates to mark his territory or growls at his enemies what he should ve done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich equally tenuous is its other running joke which involves one of his friends guy torry who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he siyah it reverse racism he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything this element doesn work the first time it mentioned and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence you don have to be as wise as an owl to realize that the animal is tame if there any reason to see this film it to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut remember her she was voted off in week 11 of the 13 week program survivor here she plays marvin sunny love interest while her role required very little actual acting she seemed very comfortable even when marvin licks the side of her face like lapping dog yuck with her adorable disposition radiant smile and playful innocence she could be meg ryan in the making it too bad that she in such mediocre offering
romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant with director peter medak whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays and top notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin they seemed likely to be successful combination those mentioned films however brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not solid well written screenplay call me cynical but the jobs of writer and producer don seem to mix well gary oldman plays jack grimaldi good cop turned bad selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname although the name doesn provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character jack has become addicted to feeding the hole hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money when he realizes his colleagues are being shot he feebly attempts to get out gary oldman performance is disappointingly weak he seems nearly bored in the process he also gets tangled up with mona demarkov russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone played adequately by roy scheider demarkov played by lena olin is tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator can remember seeing character quite like her after being shot handcuffed and thrown in the back seat of car she still manages to cause an accident kick out the windshield with her legs grab suitcase full of money plus some important documentation climb through the rubble land on her shot leg and still succeed at running for safety what woman lena olin performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo wife there is little insight into her character she depressed she makes obvious references she mopes around the house juliette lewis as romeo girlfriend is treated with the same cliche attitudes although ms lewis portrayal certainly didn improve it both women were anything but sexy or attractive poorly developed characters aside the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems it is so discouraging to watch film and want to shout at the main character not to do something for example jack and his friends attend funeral to hang in the background to scope out the mob scene fine jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite fine what does jack proceed to do he brushes his friends off by telling them he isn feeling well then strolls over to the boss why the boss had all ready threatened him falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack toes by the gravesite guess they weren worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral or here another demarkov set up her own death by cutting off her arm with circular saw she proceeded to set the place on fire wouldn the flames burn off the fingerprints aren dental records more important as bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be couldn she come up with better plot and it took her no time at all to get good fitting functional prosthesis lack of attention to detail certainly adds up in film this film doesn even add up the large details there is little or no consistency in the story line not much makes sense the direction lacks cohesion surprising from director whose previous credits are impeccable the moods shift the styles shift and no one can seem to decide if it is serious film or satire of one so while it certainly isn reservoir dogs it certainly isn diva there plenty more to tear apart in this film my advice to someone who hasn seen it to to wait until it comes on video there are some quotable lines that would provide campy evening if not taken seriously it not boring film just not good one or an intelligent one
54 is dull perfunctory uninspired and boring greater writer might have created lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors however would rather cut to the chase 54 is dull perfunctory uninspired and boring there is nothing in it not glimpse of depth nor shimmer of intelligence or insight there is no electricity in any of the scenes or moment of interest in the story or its subplots and it underdeveloped and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they re in this year boogie nights they are so wrong the picture has been assembled by mark christopher based on this film don know how he got job in the business 54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s don know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson brilliant work in every possible way from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography what it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great depth intelligence energy fascinating characters and challenging themes 54 can even measure up to the last days of disco which is flawed but still smart and entertaining it remarkably bad timing say to release film this tedious after couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind have exaggerated though there is one interesting character and one terrific performance that character is steve rubell played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves steve rubell is the owner of studio 54 and if christopher had focused on him then myers could have forced good film out of this wreck all by himself alas we are instead guided to endure the trials of young man named shane ryan phillippe going nowhere new jersey teen who gets job in the club thanks to rubell homosexual impulses it here that he meets his friends the array of uninteresting characters his co worker greg brecklin meyer his wife anita salma hayek and of course the love interest julie siyah neve campbell shane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning and he has reasonably sturdy home life some of the scenes with his father border on interesting while heather matarazzo who plays his sister pushes phillippe off the screen but he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs why his friends push him into drugs is never really explained but the fact that they are friends is questioned only is superficial ways greg gets really mad at shane because he been elevated to bartender status there isn single conflict that takes center stage except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works most of the film is dumb and most of the dialogue is inane there scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie siyah and in the next scene they re arm in arm without bit of development then they re kissing in bowling alley this is five minutes of material thrown into the picture at the last minute well past the one hour mark and this isn long film to begin with campbell is talented actress but she needs role that gives her little depth this one doesn and phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg star making role in boogie nights he seems dumb and misguided and his voice never changes tone guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body but he seems pretty lanky to me he all wrong for lead role but it doesn help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters by the end of 54 shane most notable trait is his stupid fake accent the rest of the performances are wasted hayek is an energetic talented young actress and does almost nothing here meyer is endearing but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard only myers by sheer force of talent manages to rise above christopher wading pool of script rubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance in fact myers is the sole reason to see 54 and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him ve read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail frankly don care it easy to recreate something technical like this fairly skilled production designer and few carpenters can manage such task besides christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible anyway aside from myers performance 54 is complete failure it dull perfunctory uninspired and boring some may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair but they re so obvious to me in any event 54 is pallid without the contrast it doesn even work as mindless entertainment it so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it so don forget those key words dull perfunctory uninspired and boring everything else said was just padding
an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it hollywood existence when think of the screenwriters behind this film picture room full of monkeys the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves all of the monkeys combine their efforts hop in cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark office the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clark desk while flailing his arms and shrieking the director appears to be deep in thought until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims `i love it the writing behind this project is embarrassing for your amusement will explain the plot dr kinder kathleen turner and dr heep christopher lloyd are two of the cold hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute where peculiar studies are going on as the story goes there is an ancient myth explaining that babies ages and under know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences when they move past this phase they become like any other drooling toddler kinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies namely little sylvester sly for short who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission impossible team there is so much crap derived from this premise despite the fact it virtually identical to the plot in look who talking far superior film in any league you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kung fu tactics question it obvious the babies are super smart but why are they able to fight like jackie chan the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers it shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes familiar home alone formula also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90 knowledge quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors the effects in baby geniuses similar to the talking animals in babe are pathetic the editing is disaster and the jokes are never funny the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are `cute suppose they are can admit to smiling few times because the babies were cute other instances though was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever their entire existence is based on punch lines peter macnicol and kim cattrall as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester twin are both miscast then again don suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid meanwhile dom deluise plays fellow who gets hit in the crotch with monkey wrench hahaha would avoid baby geniuses at all costs instead of watching this would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling or perhaps you would consider going diving in shark infested waters anything to avoid this painful movie the final line in the film spoken by the bratty sylvester is `if they think doing the sequel for less than $20 mill they re nuts sequel please have mercy
houston we have serious problem after making mission impossible brian de palma has lot to live up to by making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew he hopes to reach the modern audience and the possibilities are certainly there but the result is great disaster starting in near future with prologue copied from apollo 13 de palma slowly builds up his story the human race has already set foot on mars research expedition has vanished without trace on the kirmizi planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened this is basically the whole plot so it hard to imagine that it can be stretched to hours but de palma manages to do that it is not very good achievement as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space the hardest thing to do is stay awake the film major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is david mamet dialogue while trying to seem natural is distant and simply fake de palma and mamet wanted to combine action with thought provoking plot the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick 2001 space odyssey apollo 13 and godzilla to make time pass the creators have inserted several refreshing scientific details that would not convince half crazed frog it consists of multiple copies and direct ripp offs from several great science fiction films and stories when it finally presents an almost original idea it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity can even call this film predictable since no one with healthy imagination can come up with something like this sometimes it gets so cheesy that you ll start laughing when you re supposed to cry and cry when you re supposed to laugh you ll see enormous sandstorms hear mysterious sounds and last but not least on this constantly surprising tour you ll see an alien it really hard to find comparisons to such an experience and know that ve never said that before thought never would but lost in space is actually better that an achievement in itself director brian de palma has stroke altin with untouchables that became an instant american classic it is for this film that he will be remembered while all his other failures will be forgotten he ll live to fight another day send the actors my condolences since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped and dull characters and both the cinematography production design and art direction are very decent it is because of the achievement of 254 people that rate this film 10 unfortunately their hard work was in vain if you have problems with insomnia recommend you this film if you re not asleep within the first half hour consult your doctor
gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has change of heart by the film end and becomes believer in god instead of skeptic going through an amazing transformation by having christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes someone who can now beat the devil by his faith alone this is after two hours of throwing people out windows and shooting more people than your average serial killer nobody can save this bomb from it own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is positive religious type of film it just pile of dreck an ill conceived exploitive project pyrotechnical film end of days aims to be an apocalyptic thriller it features an idiotic script hack director and one dimensional star who is past his prime which makes this film dumber than dumb plus it not funny not campy or is it in the least bit entertaining it just dreary and unwatchable big budget slasher film arnold plays an alcoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stop satan occupying gabriel byrne body and possessing wall st bank account from destroying the world the film opens in vatican city roma 1979 where the pope is alerted by young visionary priest tomaso looking out at the night sky and seeing comet whiz by who proclaims after looking at his scrolls that the sign for the eye of god which reveals that child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satan baby the anti christ in the hour before the new century begins when satan will fuck her and open up the gates to hell on earth tomaso has some twenty years to find this woman and save her and the world from doom but some in the pope circle want to kill her if found even though the pope insists on having faith and letting her live as he lectures them even in the world darkest days doing evil doesn stop evil but brings on more evil we saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979 which seems to be the logical place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries the chosen woman is christine york robin it is now few days before the new year celebration for 2000 and arnold and his wise cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard wall street turd and when he is fired upon by renograde priest thomas aquinas arnold saves him and through ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot he nevertheless can speak and tells arnold an end of days is coming as prophesized in revelations but satan gets to him in his hospital room and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of the end of the world on his body it is now up to arnold to save the world and find the chosen woman he quickly finds christine and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues people jumping out of windows satan taking piss and dropping match to kill arnold partner as the piss explodes like gasoline satan being fired at resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain and sometimes nothing as if the director forgot which way he wants to have it there is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs including the subway churches and luxury buildings the only trouble with all these high budget action sequences was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value the story was so terrible and inaccurate that it did not have an iota of value or credibility mercifully the movie drags to final confrontation in times square trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000 why is the end of 1999 considered to be the devil number 666 well satan numeral is actually 999 which is upside down of 666 accordingly you just put in front of it and bingo you get 1999 with logic like that this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewer eyes and got away with such febrile explanation of the occult this film should become classic used by film schools in how not to make horror film highly recommend seeing it for that purpose
after enduring mariah carey film debut glitter reminded of bit from chris rock bigger and blacker in response to women saying that they can raise child without man rock says you can drive car with your feet but that don mean it should be done to that say you can give mariah carey movie but that certainly don mean it should be done sure there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there from the beatles hard day night to the spice girls spice world but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous start off with the story which as gruesomely predictable as it is is the least offensive part of the movie the film is inexplicably set in the 80s period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for few chicks in leg warmers worse yet everyone speaking late 90s hip hop slang in what should be 1983 meant to be partially autobiographical carey plays billie frank young singer in new york who struggles to overcome rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother influential club dj julian dice lucky max beesley playing bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro hears her sing on track and decides to make her star in predictably rapid succession billie and dice fall for each other she starts hitting it big dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass and suddenly billie on the roller coaster of superstardom in the meantime billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom won give away the ending but honestly just think of unicorns and rainbows you ll figure it out the movie screams to be made with camp and that could ve been fun but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better what mistake the brief attempts at comic relief as in scene where an effeminate russian sounding director gets wacky with filming billie first music video go over like lead balloons instead the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah most dramatic scenes which brings us to the performances of which there nothing good that can be said mariah is primarily seen with wide eyed deer in the headlights look frozen on her face she actually looks scared during her one love scene but you have to wonder if the writing isn even worse so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey virginal target audience that it probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb even the characters couldn have been written more absurdly they re all members of barbie playset the important film director who swoons billie love to put you in movie making and the big time record executive who takes billie demo tape and says oh ll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning everyone in the film is device and it painful to keep watching just to see another one appear to say more would be waste there so much wrong with this film and it pains me that mariah carey with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she likely to get but then again had to suffer through her movie
young einstein is embarrassingly lame but that didn stop it from becoming phenomenon in australia where it became the third largest box office hit of all time in the warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan inxs and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under personally hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein box office bomb young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious who not only wrote produced edited and directed the film but also starred and did his own stunts his creation is about as stupid and contrived as you expect from someone named yahoo the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein youth whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania remote australian island in addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity albert invents surfing bubbles in beer and the electric guitar yahoo plays einstein as naive and unrefined country hick clown with an insatiable curiosity although yahoo performance is at first endearing the one dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say e=mc2 yahoo has created charming family for albert and the scenes on tasmania are often clever but after the first twenty minutes the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into poor excuse for comedy young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack unfortunately the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing almost every other scene includes blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching movie or music video the instrumental score on the other hand is generally playful yahoo uses such classics as the 1812 overture and the theme from the good the bad and the ugly to great comic effect halfway through young einstein knew for sure the movie was stinker but it wasn until the very end that finally put my finger on why the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies such as young sherlock holmes but from cheesy prime time sitcoms in fact young einstein might have been more at home on network television where its sophomoric humor wouldn raise any eyebrows
susan granger review of america sweethearts columbia sony what waste of talented cast billy crystal and co writer peter tolan have concocted sly provocative premise and as the opening credits roll it obvious that they re attempting an old fashioned romantic comedy the story involves veteran publicist billy crystal who is summoned to orchestrate press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director christopher walken holds megabuck movie hostage in his editing room refusing to show it to anyone he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of possible reconciliation between the film once married but now estranged stars gwen and eddie catherine zeta jones john cusack they ll be so distracted that they won remember they didn see the movie or it wasn what they expected and crystal thought of this long before sony exec concocted the phony critic david manning quote scandal for help he turns to gwen personal assistant sister julia roberts but the laughs are few and far between crystal glib cynical flack isn wickedly funny enough with few amusing one liners after six months under the care of depak chopra like guru alan arkin cusack character too emotionally fragile lacking the necessary charisma zeta jones vain narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one dimensional only hank azaria as zeta jones much macho spanish lover and stanley tucci as studio exec and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth basically we don like these ego driven stereotypical characters let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements and joe roth direction is predictable formulaic and telegraphic on the granger movie gauge of to 10 america sweethearts is contrived shallow as screwball satire it strictly superficial

this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times it is hard to tell what is independent about this film it might as well have been made in hollywood or on home videocam it is the debut film for the director who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s where the mind set of all the characters depicted is grounded but to see it in the 1990s is different story it is old news the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn mean much since their relationship remained undeveloped the introduction of the wise guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour de force performance by the star of the film adrien brody as ray ray is the only son of low level mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield new jersey suburban basement ray sr vincent is now trying to make go of it by running small scale home repair business his son lives with him and works unhappily as shoe salesman dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open business and marry his long time waitress girlfriend joanne sybil the title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman 10b which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film you should be aware that there are lot of things about this film that don make sense its constant brainless chatter between the buddies their uneventful growing pains and the despair of their lives make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them desperate to make his dream come through ray goes to loanshark humorously and menacingly played by james moriarty and borrows 10 grand to bet on sure thing at freehold raceway the horse loses and now ray has big problems as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough there is nothing have seen so far to like about ray he is undependable mean spirited and stupid so when his best friend mike gallagher the narrator of the film gets chance to sleep with his girlfriend who cares the director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do as for ray gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen his buddies the college student mike and the dependable butchie gillan and his old man who he has this love hate relationship with rally to his aid and the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting though adrien brody showed signs that he could be future star because of his intensity and looks he reminds me of sean penn
capsule the much anticipated re adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as dark and little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting but very little intelligence visually there is much to like about this version but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver travels and treat it as an action film that makes it film without much center to +4 pierre boulle author of the bridge on the river kwai wrote planet of the apes monkey planet the novel as social satire it reads lot like fifth book of gulliver travels humans discover planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift island of the houyhnhnms the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet it seems to me there is also statement about human cruelty to animals but perhaps was just looking for that when rod serling adapted the novel into film released in 1968 he added number of serling touches familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling ish the final irony of the original version has become film history without it there could never have been planet of the apes film series can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language that could have been done in the film but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non ape speaking serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and of course there is some justification for that by the end of the film justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending but serling never tackles the all important question of why supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language language they had no opportunity to ever hear few viewers questioned this serious plot hole however and the film has become well respected in cinema history partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith best if not his best when the film success called for sequels the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well intentioned though not very subtle political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s while the first film had little shooting of guns and what was there seemed little half hearted by the second film beneath the planet of the apes there was good deal more violence and from that point on the series had lot of violence and chases the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book burton new version is even less faithful first he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes he has them both be intelligent articulate races battling for dominance of the planet currently in the hands uh make that paws of the apes that could be good story too but it is not planet of the apes as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring in 2029 leo davidson mark wahlberg not this world most expressive actor works on space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes then convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard of oz fashion and drops him on an alien planet yes he survives this storm but then no storm is perfect he quickly finds not greatly to any surprise he shows that on this planet apes rule and humans drool but everybody talks and the language they talk is earth english apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is mystery that needs to be explained about that the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not look at human animal relationships and more one of the master slave relationships outside of sudan and few other countries this is less relevant topic leo is captured to be used as slave but also is discovered by ari played by helena bonham carter ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power she is bent on making the world better place perhaps in previous draft of the script she was called hil ari in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in film she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only couple of sympathetic apes this is further abandonment of the source material the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each place in this reversed society each important in the book we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn this is miscalculation as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win the 1968 script had little subtlety with lines like never met an ape didn like but at least we cared for what happened to taylor the main character most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog this tends to limit close looks at the makeup in general it seems much improved from 1968 the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers who did it for the 1968 version in 1968 chambers makeup was jaw dropper it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion chambers is good but if anyone had chance to best him it would have to be baker today audiences have higher expectations baker visualization is really an improvement these visuals work nicely what does not work is the wire assisted leaps some of the apes make they look like they were inspired by the physics defying leaps of crouching tiger hidden dragon apes spring incredible distances some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only small group of people close up since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in role that required heavy make up the one actor who has shot is paul giamatti it is not that his lines are so good most are silly jokes but he delivers them very well he was always watchable actor but has not yet made stardom as the ape trader limbo he over emotes to overcome his ape make up but does it very well in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov performance in spartacus as an in joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself danny elfman score has nice primitive feel but jerry goldsmith 1968 tour de force score is real classic that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten rate the remake on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale
wish could accurately describe the theme music for part the best way can put it is that it funky know this is an odd question but remember the opening music of police academy citizens on patrol when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song citizens on patrol during the opening credits it just like that anyway part takes place day after the events of part so technically still 1985 this time group of horny teens who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason head up to cabin on crystal lake for weekend of sex and weed it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life which must have been between parts and so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after new batch of murders is beyond me she the lone survivor this time part was originally shown in theaters in and from what can tell from the video it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects jason had long wild hair when he was unmasked in part now one day later he completely bald also it being one day later it can be friday the 13th now can it oh well steve miner is the only director who helmed more than one film in the series [r]
jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today from time to time she blows away audiences with powerful intense performances on the other hand this is the same woman who made her jaw droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis king kong and much as lange would probably prefer movie goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume every once in while she does work that is reminiscent of it if only in quality hush is one such example lange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn such prime example of motion picture tedium the film opens as many so called psychological thrillers do by posing as light drama we are introduced to jackson johnathon schaech last encounter in tom hanks that thing you do and helen gwyneth paltrow picture perfect young couple who are very much in love jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother martha lange the moment first saw martha started looking for fangs soon the wicked witch of the east is plotting way for her son to get helen pregnant this involves poking hole in diaphragm once that goal is accomplished she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives as long as she gets her way martha is perfectly amicable person but when helen defies her it declaration of war hush has three very simple problems it incredibly dumb it incredibly boring and it incredibly predictable at least up to the stupefying ending this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it with the exception of couple of nice shots of snow covered fields and quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow bare buttocks frankly it embarrassing to watch respected actress of lange stature give performance like this it like bad blanche dubois the role she played in 1995 tv version of streetcar named desire meanwhile paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines and schaech attempts passable imitation of an inanimate object as in all psychological thrillers the battle lines are clearly drawn here it mom and against wife with jackson caught in the middle of course since schaech character is poorly developed and badly acted it impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation maybe someone should ask him if he familiar with oedipus martha is of course the evil one how do we know she evil she smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor two sure signs that the devil is at work on the other hand helen is good girl the evidence for this is that she nice to old ladies and treasures locket with picture of her dead parents that about it for character development beyond that point hush is just series of increasingly hard to swallow coincidences contrivances and moronic plot twists however the first 85 minutes are just warm up for the ending which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying can imagine anyone no matter what they thought of the movie as whole liking this conclusion either there was some serious last minute editing or someone left out few pages of the script before the climax disliked hush by the time the end credits started hated it viewers invest something in every movie they watch no matter how good or bad it is cheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable most entries into this worn out worm eaten genre aren especially good films like consenting adults the hand that rocks the cradle and single beyaz female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along in general however they re directed with degree of competence that assures level of sustained tension that not the case with really bad thrillers like this which fail to generate even momentary heart palpitation the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care indeed the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid
synopsis sonny koufax adam sandler is rich childish angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa kristy swanson in bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin jon stewart and adopts year old boy named julian cole and dylan sprouse while kevin is on an overseas trip under sonny supervision julian soon learns to lie to women tell people how he wipes his ass throw tantrums and scream for his god damned treats self centered julian breaks school classmate arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong meanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk food toys and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform not surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonny incompetent supervision and this leads to custody battle opinion it movie about an embittered creep teaching little kid to be jerk and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior that the essence of big daddy but there bigger issue involved marketing movies that are rated pg and pg 13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below on tv film clips advertise these movies as family friendly hit comedies then when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment folks in hollywood are trying to develop preteen market for raunchy stuff but think most american parents would agree that early childhood is time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation to many american mothers there probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about woman ice cold tits
the second serial killer thriller of the month is just awful oh it starts deceptively okay with handful of intriguing characters and some solid location work after baby sitter gets gutted in the suit ably spooky someone in the house prologue parallel stories unfold the first involving texas sheriff lee emery gruesome double murder and the arrival of morose fbi agent dennis quaid on the eve of voting for the local lawman reelection the second pairs hitch hiker jared leto with friendly former railroad worker danny glover they re headed west toward the rockies and away from the murder scene which one is the killer well it doesn really matter cause when writer first time director jeb stuart die hard finally spills the beans you won take his choice seriously anyway the whole thing goes south about an hour in with the tale taking hairpin turns that certainly couldn follow and through the whole thing there quaid playing with the most intense monotony this side of steven sea gal guess glad that didn walk out there some nice train stuff at the end and fun nod to dr strangelove
for original sin the road to the screen has been rocky initially slated for release last november the film was bumped twice finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001 advance screenings of the film were denied to all but few critics generally sign that the studio realizes it has dud on its hands so is original sin really all that bad yes it is but the melodrama does offer some rewards the location settings are gorgeous and there is healthy sprinkling of t&a with angelina jolie providing the and antonio banderas the more importantly the movie is entertainingly bad veteran readers know that as rule don encourage people to patronize lousy films most of the time there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides the let go laugh at the failings of others mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable but things are different this summer quality films to put it mildly have been few and far between so as far as concerned it fair to find our kicks where we may original sin will never join such treasures as valley of the dolls road house and showgirls in the bad movie hall of fame but it ll do until something worse comes along the film adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel waltz into darkness which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film mississippi mermaid opens in turn of the century prison as jolie character slated for dawn execution tells her lurid tale to priest who appears desperately horny the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like this is not love story it is story about love wary of local gold diggers cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas banderas makes arrangements to secure mail order bride from america listing himself as mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold diggers practical man luis chooses frumpy looking lady hoping she will be loyal mate able to provide him with children imagine his surprise when his fianc julia russell jolie turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo julia explains that she sent different woman image because she didn want to be selected solely for her pretty face luis then confesses his deception leading julie to state with great significance we have something in common we are both not to trusted after their wedding luis and julia retire for glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun although the filmmakers insistence on using one of banderas legs to cover jolie crotch makes it look like he trying to climb her luis the stupidest man who ever lived immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up luis must force julia to write to her sister emily who is frantic over her lack of communication shortly after julia complains about the chirping of pet bird it is found on the floor of its cage with broken neck finally when she cleans out his accounts and disappears luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong incidentally if you re afraid giving too much away rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass along the way private detective walter downs played by thomas jane who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie 61 turns up hired by the frumpy woman sister to find out what happened to the real julia luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist having decided that if he can have her he will kill her oh the pathos of it all the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story adjusting their performances accordingly banderas is suitably impassioned while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting and with those lips she can really pout as for thomas jane he starts off acting suspicious and cagey then accelerates to snidely whiplash level of nastiness his most startling moment comes when to prove his power to humiliate he forces luis against wall verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with full on kiss if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape show them this chilling scene and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and laughable potboiler show them original sin

tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss he goes into depression and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual ghetto side of every american city there lawernce attempts to steal his car but to no avail and is dragged along with robbin on trip to arizona there they hold up store are mistaken for two other robbers just like in my cousin vinny and are chased by the police and the other robbers of course there gags along the way usually from lawernce although the film is midly funny and quite watchable there something so horribly familiar about it all this film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop and pratically the same idea as midnight run it full of all the road movie cliches and even has comedy car chase which just seemed so eighties even the credit sequence seemed to be out of steve martin or chevy chase eighties comedy there also isn much chemistry between robbins and lawernce in planes trains and automobiles there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy in nothing to lose there is hardly chemistry at all towards the end the chemistry seems to work but for the bulk of the film there is hardly any the director directs the film in workman like fashion but gets the jokes across and although there is no chemistry between the two leads they give good performances on their own lawerence gives good eddie murphy performance and robbin is alright aswell however robbin performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacob ladder and the player in fact if you want to see robbin do comedy much better than in nothing to lose suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy where he is much funnier nothing to lose does have some funny moments in it however the humour isn particulary sophisticated but if you enojyed dumb dumber you might enjoy this the characters in arizona are funny and there also good scene where robbin asks shopkeeper which threatening approach was better lawerences which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper ass and swearing lot or himselfs which was speaking in deep scary voice but the gags are predictable the lack of chemistry infurating and the ending too far fetched and perfect nothing to lose then is robbin first bad movie and hopefully his last and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film he nearly ruined carrey career with ace ventura when nature calls let hope he hasn ruined robbin or even lawerence with nothing to lose
capsule not as bad sequel as crow or batman robin but still horribly putrid cheesy and ill conceived this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons extended review you know about halfway through this movie realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes you have damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy hong kong style martial arts beautifully choreographed by robin shou who also plays liu kang the fight scenes are both mind blowing and graceful acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep this is what made the original so fun but unfortunately for the sequel we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson instead they got john leonetti the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat not good choice while the fight scenes are brutal and eye popping the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare the acting is sub par which could endure if it were not for the director style the special effects the treatment of the story and characters mr leonetti should go back to lighting in my opinion could say dozens of bad things about him he way overuses slow motion he has no eye for action he can get even mediocre performances out of actors and so on but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping apparantly everybody can now fly hell all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot but not when it happens every few minutes and is done so poorly better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena warrior princess in short they should have gotten paul anderson back or at least let robin shou direct unlike the first one whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic mk special effects are bland fake looking and overall just plain bad counted at least half dozen times that blue screening was painfully obvious had this movie been made in the 80 it would have been ground breaking but in today industry it doesn even look finished now for the _really_ bad parts admit an avid fan of the mortal kombat series the games are amusing diversions an easy way to work off stress and anger the first movie was mindlessly fun thrillride this could have been really cool movie it isn the writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers some of the plot elements are just plain stupid how stupid take for instance how our heroes move around they use giants spheres the roll around underground supposedly at thousands of miles per hour oh boy even worse is the treatment of secondary characters blink and you ll miss em most characters had more depth in the video games if you thought batman robin was bad about this you ain seen nothin yet good 75% of the characters are introduced kick somebody around bit then either die or are forgotten about there no explanation at all for this and for the final blasphemy the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie lasted about minutes and then just sort of ended it almost made me weep to sum it all up rent it on video and fast forward through everything except the fight scenes
in the astronaut wife charlize theron plays young woman with nervous demeanor pixie hairdo and demon spawn unwittingly growing in her belly if only her name wasn jillian the makers of this embarrassing bit of sci fi shlock could have come up with far more appropriate title rosemary species what shame it is to see such gifted actress as theron oscar worthy in the devil advocate struggle with the lamest rip off of screendom classic in recent memory ok maybe the astronaut wife deviates from rosemary baby turf for its set up which finds our heroine terrorized not by satan minions but her possessed husband johnny depp shuttle pilot whose mission mishap leaves him um changed man predictably he and the missus get it on in sequence best described as unpleasant his evil seed impregnating her with twins and realizing that great bowfinger line about alien love theron advocate character faced similar dilemma the horror there resonating strongly astronaut provides only artificial anxiety last year equally noodle headed species ii spun similar premise about the breeding habits of an extraterrestrial on earth but at least that movie more or less knew it was garbage the astronaut wife is grave and humor free passing its increasingly silly story off as full fledged serious right down to an ambiguous finale that isn even going to satisfy those who ve stayed with it thus far here hint it involves lots of water electrical equipment special effect from the abyss and the tots who doubled up as adam sandler co star in big daddy draw your own conclusions director writer rand ravich coats the proceedings in dynamic sights masterminded by legendary cinematographer allen daviau but too often favors the film visual presentation over the story he trying to tell this bodes horribly for each dramatic development like the surfacing of suspicious nasa official speed joe morton to instigate jill slow and stupid comprehension of the truth his hyper erratic behavior is probably supposed to give wife paranoid edge instead he adds to the phoniness theron and depp are certainly beyond this junk and will get other chances to prove themselves this fall she as part of an imposing ensemble case in the john irving adaptation cider house rules he in the lead of tim burton eagerly awaited sleepy hollow undeserving of such talent the astronaut wife manages to be derivative dull and uninvolving despite its seemingly ripe potential for unintentional laughs in space no one can hear you scream but in movie theatre everyone can hear you snore
for good ten years or so super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene now he has followed in the footsteps of director john woo who launched chow super stardom in the acclaimed better tomorrow by moving to hollywood had some reservations about this move and it would seem was right to have them chow plays hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay debt his final job requires him to kill policeman seven year old boy this he refuses do and runs however he is forced into violent confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers are brought in to do the job cue around 80 minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot outs which take place in various locations some thought had gone into making them bit different but unfortunately they end up being just plain boring the car wash scene found myself laughing at how stupid it looked tut tut the emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music could have sworn one piece was ripped out of bruckheimer movie and not on the content mia sorvino passport forger is dragged into the affay and also provides lame love interest as well as being rather handy with gun director antoine arqua has clearly not observed chow excellent acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter few lines of broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots chow trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale which in fairness is quite good and there not even toothpick in site and as for making chow shoot like cop well that damned unforgiveable to round up the replacement killers is pretty darned lame first outing for chow it would appear he has left asia for 90 minute pop video this is not what we wanted at all considering john woo was the exec producer did he have no say so at all watch the killer again and weep at the difference review by chris hill there room at the top they are telling you still but first you must learn how to smile as you kill if you want to be like the folks on the hill

the swirling sick feeling hit me just few minutes into heartbreakers ray liotta character was making out with his secretary when his new wife knocked on the door of his office while scrambling to collect himself he frantically shouted to her just wait sex er mean sec was struck by wave of revulsion thinking geez didn lines like that die when three company was canceled over the next few minutes as the barely double entendres and lingering cleavage shots grew more numerous realized that the mindset behind heartbreakers predated three company suddenly had an out of body experience as my internal way back machine swept me to the mid 1960s all across america the counter culture was growing like wildfire but there was scant evidence of it on tv while young people were challenging traditional values on the streets frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at home sulking while our parents enjoyed the latest bob hope special women in skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while hope made growling noises and leered at their breasts on another channel dean martin made wisecracks about booze and broads and peter lawford decked out in love beads and nehru jacket purred suggestive one liners as he ogled the go go dancers the adults laughed and laughed heartbreakers reeks of that stagnant mentality from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt vah vah voom breasts to its leaden screenplay which paints women as haughty schemers and men as drooling buffoons too sex obsessed to realize they are being manipulated in addition to liotta and hewitt the cast includes sigourney weaver gene hackman jason lee nora dunn and anne bancroft can imagine what drew performers of their caliber to this project perhaps they thought it was parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the 60s if so they were sadly mistaken the story revolves around mother daughter con team it opens with the marriage of max weaver to dean liotta new jersey chop shop operator having withheld sex until the honeymoon max pretends to pass out on their wedding night the next morning she feigns illness sending very horny dean off to the office where he ends up in the arms of his new secretary just as the two are about to get overtly physical max bursts into the room and catches them the horrified bride dissolves the union garnering healthy cash settlement along the way of course the secretary was really her daughter page hewitt and the whole thing was set up the women move on but an irs agent bancroft catches up with them and demands huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes in desperate need of funds max and page head for palm beach to replay the scam their mark this time is william tensy hackman in hideous make up decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking max starts to put the game into action but page is so repelled by the old man and angry with her mom that she slips off to enact her own score targeting jack laid back young beach bar owner who is worth fortune complications arise when page realizes that good natured jack is stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart as if that wasn enough dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind the attempt to weld romance onto caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior fish called wanda won bother to compare the two suffice to say that everything done right in wanda is done wrong here heartbreakers is soulless inept and at 123 minutes at least half hour too long sigourney weaver and jennifer love hewitt throw themselves into their parts but have nowhere to go with the metallic characters gene hackman is utterly wasted in one note one joke part that has him doing nothing but smoking coughing and waxing rhapsodic about smoking and sex poor jason lee is stuck in the ingenue role and the normally charismatic actor comes off as merely bland ray liotta manages to squeeze tiny bit of humanity and humor into his walking clich but only bit the low point in the film has weaver employing russian accent bad enough to make boris and natasha wince while doing half assed slapstick with broken off penis from statue bear in mind though that this is merely the worst segment of movie made up of nothing but low points if you remember bob hope specials with fondness this might be your cup of tea as for me going to watch fish called wanda now and try to forget ever saw heartbreakers
american pie alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summer attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute couple ness and zany comedy it about an a+ student biggs as paul who gets scholarship to some college in new york city who sticks out like sore thumb and falls for dora suvari ditzy heroin chic goth chick who has no ambition or self respect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed around just like hick boy paul is so we ve got fish out water formula mixed with meet cute romantic comedy which ideally should make for good movie unfortunately the atrocious screenplay and boring direction by clueless auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to screw up everything about the film these characters are totally unrealistic and unbelievable it as if everyone under age 30 is stoned raver there no background or details to anyone or anything it just bunch of cartoon characters running into each other not to mention the story itself which is virtually non existant and contains so many plotholes it like swiss cheese even the basic editing is bad if you re looking for romantic comedy stay far away from this one because it is neither romantic nor funny saw this in packed cinema on opening night and the audience barely laughed at all if you ve seen the commericials you ve seen all the funny parts which are all from the first five minutes
last summer feature length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of unanimous critical panning based on the famous 60 television show the film was an enormous box office flop and huge disappointment for warner bros year later the studio is up to their old tricks again with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild wild west but it sounded promising the same tag team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld who both contributed to make men in siyah such financial success is at the reins again and co star kevin kline is attached to the project as well as substantial budget to spice up the special effects mean what could possibly go wrong the answer is just about everything wild wild west is cinematic abomination film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given proper chance to get out of the gate there are lot of fancy special effects and handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make lasting impression but the script is so deliriously uneven the entire movie so off course that no human being or technical achievement has chance to salvage it at square one we have bizarre case of casting will smith plays james west renegade cowboy who was originally played by beyaz actor robert conrad in the tv series my guess regarding the casting of african american smith is simple one the actor cozy summertime release big bucks for all those involved smith is very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material but this is not an ideal role for him he too much of joker heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role and frankly that sounds lot more plausible what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self assurance in his eyes you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be huge hit at the summer box office the plot involves west and cross dressing government agent artemus gordon kevin kline who are assigned by the president to recover group of kidnapped scientists the trail leads to the diabolical dr arliss loveless kenneth branagh man with no lower body who speaks in dry witty southern accent loveless has taken the country top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns one such weapon is an 80 foot mechanical tarantula bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular seamlessly blending computer generated imagery with the western surroundings unfortunately all of these effects seem so detached from the story and can do little to support the film plot deficiencies which are undoubtedly the main problem wild wild west is running gag that never truly works most of the jokes usually care of smith die on arrival if it one thing that could possibly be the saving grace it the performances and even they are mostly off kilter and poorly delivered kline is admirable but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest because she is viewed as little more than that window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon branagh an esteemed shakespearean actor and director adds marginal enjoyment to the film but even he is so utterly weird and over the top rarely is film so lost in itself as wild wild west is suppose there always one turkey of the summer season highly anticipated big budget release that manages to completely disappoint wild wild west is such movie and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office perhaps after this audiences will be less assured when they see will smith name stamped on summer movie after such hits as independence day and mib wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume
it probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre the matrix existenz would collide with the even more popular serial killer genre kiss the girls se7en the result should have been more interesting than the cell as the movie opens therapist catharine deane jennifer lopez treats catatonic boy colton james by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that never fully explained after months of therapy sessions in surreal desert catharine has no success to report meanwhile killer carl stargher vincent onofrio has claimed another victim his particular hobby is to kidnap young women keep them in glass cell overnight and drown them he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching video tape of the drowning although carl been doing this for awhile he recently become sloppy and fbi agent peter novak vince vaughn is closing in fast not fast enough though to keep carl from sticking another woman tara subkoff in the cell or to catch him before he suffers schizophrenic attack that leaves him in coma from the videos in carl house peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction to save the kidnapped girl peter has to find the cell before the end of the day and comatose carl not talking so off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl mind and find out where the cell is in time the focus of the cell in on the ornate interior of carl mind but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality for the most part it style without substance in his own mind carl is decadent emperor in flowing robes ming the merciless as well as frightened boy jake thomas abused by his father all in all the mind of psycho killer turns out to be strangely dull place and kept wishing could fast forward to the next development singh is best known for directing music videos particularly rem losing my religion and the cell seems very much like really long really slow mtv video with the sound deleted singer lopez seems to think she in video as well she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting the premise had great promise the computer generated world within carl mind could have been bizarre surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic the first room catharine enters in carl head shows this promise she finds horse standing in center of the room suddenly sheets of sharp edged glass fall into the horse dividing it into segments the panes of glass separate pulling apart the pieces of the still living horse this scene is twisted disturbing and thought provoking because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder another element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of psychopath their minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharine own psyche like sidney lumet the offence or michael mann manhunter the cell could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out repressed darkness in the investigator however catharine character is hardly developed at all and lopez has no depth to offer the role bottom line don get trapped in this one
synopsis an aging master art thief his supplier and young buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be or are they in this convoluted mess involving risky heist during the millennium comments this movie was boring plain and simple entrapment should not have been boring it stars sean connery who can still carry an action film despite his age catherine zeta jones likeable enough film presence and ving rhames ultra cool star of pulp fiction and mission impossible it takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears current hot topic in the news in its storyline which is set at the end of 1999 it has some genuinely well staged action sequences so what went wrong plenty unfortunately the major problem with entrapment is its script it has been there done that feel to it nothing seems particularly inventive or original so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags it runs nearly two hours the screenwriters for example periodically use countdown to the millennium as means of transition between scenes days to the millennium this device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci fi film strange days the characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth surprise revelation is made entrapment in other words relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character true motive is resulting in convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion the star power here is quite strong but the viewer can help but feel the actors are wasted in this production sean connery is given such mind numbing lines as never trust naked woman ving rhames character seems like an afterthought he not developed at all the camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zeta jones tight wardrobe this in and of itself is not bad but after while it has juvenile feel to it at least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that they re exploiting the female body entrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot development sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her in tights arc and pivot around laser beams the tagline for this movie reads the trap is set it sure is on those who spent money to see this movie entrapment really isn that bad it is watchable would suggest however one waits until this is on cable or television to see it
the first image in final fantasy the spirits within is computer animated close up of human eye it beautiful piece of work remarkably detailed and quite convincing when the picture pulls back to reveal the owner of the eye however things change the young woman has mesmerizing hair although it hangs too artfully even by movie standards to be believed the facial features are more detailed than any computer animation seen to date but the result is more reminiscent of very well crafted doll than anything human she is pretty but bland and not nearly expressive enough to come off like person all the characters in final fantasy are like that of the core group the younger beyaz men and women are all athletic attractive and indistinct like applicants for tv reality show the siyah man is taller and burlier and the aging scholar is bald with wrinkles and beard none of them appear to be based on individuals they all look like the products of general descriptions given police sketch artist it gets worse when they talk and move why is the sarcastic voice of steve buscemi he of the great twisted face and snaggleteeth coming out of the mouth of some dreary ken doll why for every fluid physical gesture do we also see herky jerky puppet style motions more to the point who decided full length computer animated movie featuring hyperreal their term not mine humanoids was good idea final fantasy is based on phenomenally popular video game ve never played with story straight out of japanese anime which more often than not leaves me bored and depressed if you re fan of either please spare me your letters as will focus solely on the finished film and not its source materials with an expression challenged cast final fantasy mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit the result is ugly confusing and boring note the following reveals the basic plot if you want to have fighting chance of making any sense of the movie suggest you read it earth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls most of our planet is devastated with humans living in few protected cities while the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies aki ross voiced by ming na and her mentor dr sid donald sutherland believe in more organic approach they operate on the notion quoting straight from the press kit that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified and contained aki and dr sid collect series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form wave of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force the waves will in effect cancel each other out and disarm the foreign contagion they have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave they are on desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out are you still with me there only little more aki is infected with the alien force dr sid has developed method of confining the contagion and keeping it from killing her but the defense wall won hold much longer already the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams aiding aki and dr sid are the deep eyes group of hard as nails types that would have felt at home with the troops in aliens capt gray edwards alec baldwin heads the task force that consists of wise guy buscemi tough woman peri gilpin and gentle giant ving rhames throwing monkey wrench into the plans is the requisite dumb ass in this case general hein james woods who wants to use the zeus cannon to bomb the aliens back to the stone age even if it destroys earth as well so there you have it like most of the anime ve seen the plot combines apocalyptic settings lots of shooting and fuzzy spirituality all wrapped up in save the earth bow but bored with apocalyptic settings understand why so many live action films employ them they re cheap but animated films can show anything so why wallow in an industrial trash heap the action scenes and shoot em ups don satisfy either the humans move oddly and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast can bring them to life in fact their efforts merely emphasize what we re missing aki is especially disappointing with her lack of expression and flat delivery she looks and sound like brunet version of weena the eloi girl from 1960 the time machine drab color choices and aliens that appear to have been created in jell molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces students of computer animation may be fascinated with the technology behind final fantasy the spirits within but found it sub par across the board futurama does more effective battle visuals the kids in south park are far more expressive than these mannequins and any old episode of the contemporary version of the outer limits does better doom and gloom sci fi so who needs this not me
plot token director alan smithee steals the only copy of his film trio from the studio after they complete the final cut without him he threatens to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision critique wow really can remember the last time movie sucked on so many levels the comedy in this film is pathetic obvious and dated oj simpson jokes galore the plot is uninteresting boring and bad the structure of the film is annoying repetitive and pretentious the acting is pretty bad especially jackie chan who can act to save his life the cameos are lame and seem forced and the ending blows chunks all in all this movie believes itself to be clever humorous and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood but comes across as boring stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans but this one bites the big one see it if you like to watch really bad movies otherwise skip it because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it luckily for us all this mess only lasts about 80 minutes and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays lead faced detective by the way is there any reason why the studio or the producer couldn have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock that was left over who knows who cares this satire sucks the bag little known facts about this film and its stars ironically the original director of this film arthur hiller also requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the dga alan smithee moniker this was after the film production company cinergi pictures preferred the cut made by producer writer joe eszterhas to his the original script of this film included arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis eszterhas announced through the media during post production that cinergi pictures didn have the money to pay for soundtrack he said that he would finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it to him he received 200 cds and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned artists listened to all that was sent at least couple of tracks from each record and compiled the soundtrack this film practically swept the razzie awards in 1999 given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year with no less than the worst picture award the worst screenplay joe eszterhas the worst supporting actor joe eszterhas the worst new star joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer and the worst original song wanna be mike ovitz as written by joe eszterhas
plot rich guy who doesn believe in love orders mail order bride for himself that very evening the couple is married and fall madly in love soon thereafter but what this one of them might not be the person they are pretending to be wow sin indeed critique easily one of the worst movies that ve seen all year too long too boring too predictable and too ridiculous for anyone interested in watching good movie what the hell were they thinking when they made this thing it no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about year this felt like really bad tv movie of the week with some nudity stuffed in from time to time just to wake up the audience have you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies one that you just couldn help but switch back to from time to time just to make sure that it wasn part of some sick joke well this movie is exactly like that only it isn joke it isn on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it say again what the shite were they thinking okay so where do start first of all the trailer of this film gives away the movie main plot twist the betrayal so for the first half hour of the film you re basically just sitting there watching these two lovers go through the motions until the betrayal occurs whoopee big surprise second of all angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part why well it like this not for one second do you ever believe that she is not nasty backstabbing woman mean it like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining well the same goes here every look in jolie eyes screams psycho then of course you have the case of the patsy husband man who just can seem to figure out anything in time mean how boring is that for the audience you re watching this guy screw up time after time after time and somehow we re supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude no thanks and if we don care about him and we really don care about her she beeyatch and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film well ll tell you the only thing that was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled no suspense no chemistry between the leads no real love or passion no sense of surprise plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending so why am even giving this film rating of three points well it actually pretty simple liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of jolie boobies that two points right there and another one for antonio ass hairless just for the record everything else in this movie was pointless boring and just plain stupid try imagining soft porn movie but without the plot that pretty much what you ve got here low point in the careers of both stars oops almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue god oh mighty make it stop where joblo coming from american psycho 10 cruel intentions 10 eyes wide shut 10 fatal attraction 10 playing by heart 10 under suspicion 10 what lies beneath 10 what women want 10 whipped 10
not great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie earlier this year nora ephron wrote and produced one of the year least likeable comedies called hanging up featuring bunch of annoying women ironically lisa kudrow played one in that film as well who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves ick real sweet stuff but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer with film entitled battlefield earth seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film even if it was on cheese factor as everybody and mean everybody else pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time yipes another beauty so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with movie co starring the ever versatile lisa kudrow uhhhm you guessed it not much plot in order to escape major financial difficulties local weatherman hooks up with his ball picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery but as more and more people find out about their scheme more and more people demand part of their winnings and more and more problems arise critique simply stated didn laugh once during this entire picture for comedy it offered me few smiles bunch of nincompoops as characters miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow in what can only described as sluttier version of her character of phoebe on tv friends this film was not as disastrous as thought it would be but it was pretty close thankfully the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits dancing as the weatherman were left in the film trailer and not in this final cut and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far beautiful this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast foremost was travolta character who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie and for me the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong he didn fit the part just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role cool calculating roughneck with certain hip suave je ne sais quoi in this film he looks like he trying to be funny trying to be bad trying to be good we re not supposed to be able to notice that and when we do at least in my case consider it wrong choice in casting add that to lisa kudrow boring us with yet another one of her patented dumb blonde routines but this time dressed in sexier outfits michael rapaport stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn quite up at the same speed level as everyone else and truckload of empty comedic bullet shells and you ve got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize the only real good thing that could say about this film is that its story was actually half interesting and never really bored me also liked michael moore perverted cousin character and loved and say it again loved the character that bill pullman played give this dude his own movie he played lazy cop man who tries everything not to do any real work he fakes injuries to get off duty tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won have to fill out any forms now there base of humor sadly the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film and there not much else can say about this movie folks on the whole it was lame included slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in pool of unfunny lines and very little of interest for any target audience but get somebody to write up movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and there
the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry cage is legendary retired car thief memphis raines don you love cute movie names who must call upon his time worn skills to save his thick headed brother ribisi from being killed seems murderous crime boss eccleston with fetish for wood insert your own joke hired brother kip to steal ridiculous amount of expensive exotic autos fifty cars to be exact poor kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly if the cars aren delivered in three days bossman has casket carved out just for kip literally if only someone could save him hmmmm wonder what memphis is doing in order to give the film some emotional heft there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of yawn excuse me dramatic tension shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe lindo who looking to send memphis away will he catch him there old flame sway jolie who had her heart broken by memphis years ago will they get back together shortsighted thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother yet resents him for moving away from the family will they reconnect raines old mentor duvall has long since left the life of crime will memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life one more time can you answer all these questions correctly in seconds without seeing the film first ll bet you can following the opening credits which fill you in on the accomplishments of the raines family through montage of old photos we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis he first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive go carts in later scene as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control all the while making breakfast metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions just as pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it big brother memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it looks like everything might turn out alright after all you know this because the music swells on the crest of violins that about as strong as the characterization gets which is shame bruckheimer has real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis or maybe it just the cars duvall trots out his ornery but sweet old codger outfit sure he still laughing at taking paycheck for this one lindo projects warm hearted but tightly focused detective that almost transcends the material the biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones who plays mute accomplice of memphis without saying word he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie like blast of nitrous oxide he attacks each scene with straightforward zeal too bad his minutes onscreen are so few somehow bruckheimer manages to attract top hollywood acting talent to high concept poorly written movies gussies up the film with lots of altin hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes every time something clever happens it counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing you re watching movie there innovative usage of siyah lighting that goes from being novelty to part of the plot it counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing driver test imagine the yuks there segment where one of the thieves shows another his cool fake fingerprint trick it countered by the lame semi subplot of car being stolen with bunch of heroin in the trunk the ramifications are never explored then there the ridiculousness of the many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars not only is it stupid but it against the law this is movie made of pretty but tepid car chases strung together by just enough character interaction to move the plot along gone in 60 seconds aptly describes how long it ll take for this marginally entertaining but empty film to leave your memory
first and foremost think this movie comes to grief at the hands of the pg rating it been given for those of us who haven read the james lee burke novel that heaven prisoners is based on do not rabidly go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin and eric roberts feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps gangsters with louisiana accents plots sub plots more plots and well really just want to see teri hatcher naked this is one movie you re going to worry the price of admission over hopeful still well let me share my moment of sheer panic and then the cold enervation of the big let down when semi robed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin what do you think of my butterfly butterfly asked myself what butterfly and then it hit me the scene had been snipped damn you godless pg rating show us her butterfly we want to see the goddamn butterfly so no naked teri hatcher forget about that okay now heaven prisoners is about ex alchoholic ex cop dave robicheaux alec baldwin who trying to discover life anew running bait shop and boat hire business with his loving down to earth wife annie kelly lynch everything dull but hunky dory until plane carrying illegal immigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while they re on their boat the plane nosedives into the water and sinks but from its wreckage robicheaux rescues little pixie faced salvadoran girl whom he and his wife immediately decide to adopt what they don realise is that the plane pilot was also drug dealer and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latter erstwhile colleagues when robicheaux discovers this he predictably against the advice of his wife well meaning dea agent and two gangsters who rough him up begins poking his nose where it don belong we know that the man deserves all the misery he going to get the question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the ride through tedious meandering yet utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your guide as dave robicheaux alec baldwin is fat no seriously this is not the svelte thinking man hero of the hunt for kirmizi october it is an out of shape guy who doesn look too good in roof top chasing scene he also unconvincing in the movie dramatic moments acting with what as far as can tell is steven segal like economy of expression three quarters of the way through the show while you re probably waiting for the next scene in bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to the temptation of the whiskey bottle getting drunk and beating up someone or getting beaten up you ll want to beat on him little yourself on the other hand mary stuart masterson some kind of wonderful fried green tomatoes benny joon cast as down and out stripper who has her fingers broken is quite breath of fresh air with just the right mix of cynicism warmth insecurity and humour to be the movie only endearing character eric roberts as bubba rocque always believable as the woman abusing bad guy who knows how to box see final analysis coincidentally also directed by phil joanou is believable here as the woman abusing bad guy who knows how to box and lest we forget teri hatcher role in all this this being her rather well publicised paid vacation from playing lois lane on tv adventures of lois clark she is totally ridiculous as rocque manipulative and seductive cajun wife coming across as devious as mildly disgruntled au pair who trying to get back at an employer who hasn been giving her enough days off it probably safe to say that her day job beckons and at the end of our day none of this is really worth hrs and 12 minutes of our personal misery the flying inkpot rating system wait for the video little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
it amazing how comedian can have the some of the funniest stand up around but completely fall flat in the movies take adam sandler on the basis of his first two cds they re all gonna laugh at you and what the hell happened to me he the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams but when you put him in front of camera it just isn the same kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted marginal recommendation but his latest film the waterboy is about as funny as root canal seriously willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here in fact found this movie to be more depressing than comedic the first half hour generated not one smile in me with it scenes of emotional abuse towards adam character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players but also by his very disturbed mother kathy bates what is the world coming to granted after the film gets rolling there are few mild chuckles throughout even willing to admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice but not nearly enough to sustain the waterboy for it nearly hour and half running time you re all familiar with the plot because you ve seen it at least million times before everyone picks on the hero until he shows hidden talent and leads the underdog team to victory over the champions in the process not only winning the respect of his teammates but also getting the woman he loves and believe me not giving anything away by saying that sandler team wins if you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie then god be with you the only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobby love interest mean they should be lending their talents to some loftier purpose but they do extremely well with what they are given here kudos to both of them my advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin who made very smooth and successful transition from stage to screen rely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises to make people laugh or maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have like jim carrey did with the recent truman show with the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses he just can keep going on like this
according to popular film opinion film greatness is determined by time take for example casablanca great film even today it still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic another example would be star wars which had very very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about billion times before but as rewatched independence day when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 kinda felt like it wasn as cool as when had first seen it had liked it when saw it the first time was my original view and basically saw it as good escape film but when rewatched it felt cheated thus the curse of the event film independence day is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once except for couple kids the critics in this situation but after while this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one well this kid is the event film in my little analogy and when rewatched independence day not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen but felt insulted the whole time there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren sure if it comedy or hokey drama one scene you ll see hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch the next you ll see bunch of military uptight guys walking around saying corny lines the worst is scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of glen or glenda now this annoying kid problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once he shows he has no balls and independence day has no balls it plays it safe everywhere it throws in ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of star wars mean isn that devil den and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore breasts in striptease they re these octopus men boring freaking octopus men mean come on the aliens in 2001 were more interesting and you didn even see them basically the plot is straight from movie from the 50s aliens come to earth and we wonder if they re hostile or peaceful okay it an interesting topic but it not handled greatly now they aren and somehow computer geek jeff goldblum figure out they re using our satellites as countdown to destruction yep these aliens are not only heavily armed they re stupid too they also use the same kind of computer as we do but that comes about later the president bill pullman who under attack for being wimp decides this would be nice time to be belligerent and he decides he ll stay in the beyaz house which the aliens have covered don care if it bob freaking dole in the beyaz house get him out of there don care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol just get him out of there later on he stupid and wants to fly in the attack on big alien ship think it time for impeachment for this guy he more senile than reagan on pot then there cocky pilot will smith who is the only person to survive the counter attack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51 the film only sign of being brave his girlfriend stripper sharing subplot with striptease in that she has to do it for her son come on she has fighter pilot boyfriend soon to be fiance think she can quit that job and get more respectable job at long john silvers she also the few the proud the lucky to survive the igniting of as well as her dog who narrowly survives there are some bright spots they tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing the best one is when jeff goldblum nicely named david turns on his computer and picture of hal comes up and says good morning dave and they even played it the end of the world as we know it and feel fine at the beginning and judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great he stereotype but just loved the man anyway but there are no real subtle comic moments will gets way too many one liners and he has no one to play off of execept jeff towards the end and the two do great as said this film has no balls it is just aiming for crowd pleaser and that what it is but after couple months we all move on to the next event film while intaking little films and couple indy ones for good measure but at least the indy ones last for lifetime this one short on batteries
by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer it possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending which is an insulting cop out somewhere out there maybe there small cadre of film goers who will appreciate sphere dubious charms but not among them sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by it hard to understand why the rights were optioned sphere is the kind of first class mess that only top line director with an list cast can create with expectations high and how could they not be considering that another barry levinson dustin hoffman collaboration the excellent wag the dog is still playing in theaters something this bad can help but look even worse the last time big name big budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year batman robin and everyone knows how that movie was received sphere starts out little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron the abyss but somewhere along the way it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort event horizon science and philosophy which are used to good effect during sphere first hour give way to mindless confusing action sequences attempts at characterization fall apart intelligent writing which is evident early on is replaced by hackneyed drivel special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness but all that is just in preparation for the ending which is inexcusably awful this is the time honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film there is some promise but it all in the setup we re introduced to norman goodman dustin hoffman psychologist who once wrote $35 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that crashed space ship is discovered when one is found in the middle of nowhere 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee on the team with him are beth halperin sharon stone biochemist who was once his student and lover harry adams samuel jackson mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ted fielding liev schreiber an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology and harold barnes peter coyote the government operative in charge of the mission together the five descend into the bowels of the ocean where they rendezvous with temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact for while sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man meets alien situation the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship apparently from the future offer intriguing possibilities then right around the one hour mark that the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever left of titanic the virtually non stop action begins and once it starts the script becomes superfluous this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension but instead he relies on loud overbearing music strange camera angles and quick cuts to make things exciting additionally because none of the characters are well formed common failing in anything penned by crichton who more interested in technology than people viewers don develop much of rooting interest it makes sitting through sphere frustrating and pointless experience what about that list cast not surprisingly the most energetic performance is given by samuel jackson but his harry isn person he walking plot device spouting occasionally witty dialogue dustin hoffman isn lively or particularly good it ironic that this which may be his worst work in decade has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination for wag the dog sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion automatons would have been as effective then there queen latifa who despite getting fifth billing in the credits ahead of liev schreiber who boasts at least quadruple her screen time has less than handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count like to think that levinson and hoffman recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be chose to make wag the dog as sort of penance the low budget picture was filmed during sphere lengthy pre production phase if that the case forgiveness is granted less inclined to look favorably upon crichton although he has few enjoyable titles on his resume jurassic park and the levinson directed disclosure come to mind even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process crichton credit as producer disallows him absolution he was willing participant in creative travesty no wonder sphere is being released in february in the midst of the early year cinematic wasteland it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic which should plow sphere under on its way to ninth consecutive weekend atop the box office heap
shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen it is both humorous and romantic in very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly and and half hours that it occupies that is however not to say it is good film quality production or anything of the sort shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work the finest sign of this may be the plot in looking back there seems to be little more than thin predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books philip henslowe geoffrey rush owns of the theatres in london it is at the peak of the royal theatre era and queen elizabeth the recently damed judi dench by appropriately enough queen elizabeth ii is very much fan however to directly quote the film he has cash flow problems through long set of events it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts so mr henslowe employs the young playwright william shakespeare joseph fiennes to pen comedic production however the young writer has severe case of writer block and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well he has the title in mind romeo and ethel the pirate daughter even that joke loses steam after while but can seem to put words to paper then as only hollywood could have it through long set of twisted events he meets viola de lesseps gwyneth paltrow and falls madly in love thus curing his writer block there are many other little issues that mr henslowe encounters but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing the first realization that reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that show should not always be credited to it author ironically that couldn be truer here the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner but rather young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love so it is that am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond character name in the credits the acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth theatres joseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though he is tragically unbelievable and comically bad gwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well however the supporting cast does almost save the day geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking they both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links you will also find very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting no armageddon doesn qualify as real acting and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well but not even they could save this sad excuse for film so it remains plagued by poor performances when all is said and done shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained however as the film so kindly pointed out entertainment may be fun but it isn necessarily quality and this certainly isn quality perhaps this may be best compared to john grisham novel as dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work simply put it is far fetched poorly crafted but very entertaining
at times you think edtv would be an entertaining film mean who can resist the story of your average joe becomming celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day but this average joe ed perkuny matthew mcconaughay is sappy lifeless creation that wanders around trying to solve everyone problems and settle his own mcconaughay is awful especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with week beard and torn jeans frankly he had more charm in the devestating flop the newton boys he overacts in every way his overexaggerant body language obsession with kissing women every second he gets the chance and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life and drops to his knee and cries the rest of the cast is very good especially martin landau as ed step father who plays cute role as the close to death old guy that makes all the witty comments jenna elfman is good but little overemotional her main problem is that she keeps getting sucked into bad films can hardly wait and krippendorf tribe woody harrelson as ed brother ray does his usual egg headed role with his comic wit as well he wrote book entitled my brother pissed on me elizabeth hurley is perfectly cast as the easy slut and dennis hopper in quick cameo as ed biological father is nice choice ironically coming after the role he turned down as christof in the truman show ellen degeneres stood out as the executive who after awhile decides the show must not go on much to the opposite of the head exec rob reiner opinion hate to compare this film to the truman show but the fact is was ashamed to see this movie it felt that had dropped from college to kindergarten after seeing truman and ed edtv had no real wit or genius it was typical hollywood extracting the tv part of the movie you have the simple plotline man steals brother girlfriend girlfriend leaves town man gets new slut girlfriend to feel like he can move on slut breaks up with him real girlfriend comes back and voila you have romance got so restless during this movie almost walked out the only reason it doesn drop below grade is because of the fine supporting performances ad2am almost lost my nose and like it like breathing through it jack nicholson chinatown
five years after his directorial debut based on stephen king writings called the shawshank redemption 10 writer director frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king unlike the latter film this one is big long laborious bore plot seven foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers critique this film is slow drawn out boring uninteresting unexciting predictable and topped with couple of one dimensional evil characters its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles the real miracle of my night was the fact that did not fall asleep during this straightforward unimpressive film about guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about of course much like all other death row cell blocks this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be misunderstood except for one cookie cutter crazy guy who is evil personified and let not forget all the guards on death row who also happen to be angels from the heaven above except for one cookie cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates am supposed to identify with anyone in this film or even more importantly am supposed to give rat ass about anyone in this film well if was sure missed that boat because the only thing that ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin furthermore there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone life to present this story in fact the story is empty within itself truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is guy on death row who has special powers to heal and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not wow how interesting the plot utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film we are told that one certain lady has tumor early on in the movie whip out those thinking caps kids hmmm and wonder what will happen to those two cookie cutter evil guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity hmmmm now think hard here boys and girls what crock am guessing that this film was supposed to be some three hour exercise in spirituality but unfortunately for me it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging in fact it was one big bore didn see the point of the movie didn see the point of the story and certainly didn see the point in tom hanks big double chin all in all bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour john coffey give that man an award or something
synopsis small town thug convinces dimwitted high school student to spy on his girlfriend who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on friday night while this is going on the thug the father the boyfriend and kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter comments to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter suspense family drama humor erotica elements of each of these genres exist in the film yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them instead the babysitter is dull lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing alicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer the babysitter her character has absolutely no depth at all and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters fantasies everyone else in the film seems to be in competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends the parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds the father played by walsh fantasizes about the babysitter the mother fantasizes about her husband best friend none of these fantasy sequences trust me are things that need to be seen but we see them anyway complete with cheesy make out saxophone music the thug in the meantime proves that he evil through his annoying habit of smashing half empty beer bottles all of sudden and for no apparent reason the most absurd character however is the babysitter boyfriend who seems catatonically brain dead the thug in manipulative iago like manner though he doesn really need to try hard manages to talk the boyfriend into binge drinking smoking grass running away from cops and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in matter of minutes incredible of course the boyfriend original plan for the evening was try not to laugh to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by salinger if the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful then it fails there are surprisingly few tense moments in this film and nearly all of them come at the final minute by that time however the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them no suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously dream sequence from its inception if the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous then it also fails found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed at times to be played for laughs if the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic then once again it fails the characters are one dimensional and uninteresting finally if the goal of the babysitter was to be titillating the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at in the morning then it fails as well the dream sequences aren erotic they are too brief and outside of one very short scene contain no nudity can completely trash this movie the first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film and the conclusion sports halfway decent fistfight the other 79 minutes though are drag silverstone character at the end of the movie turns to her boyfriend and asks what were you thinking asked myself the same question having spent 99 cents renting this turkey
working in the motion picture industry must be constant source of frustration for front line african american actress like jada pinkett smith despite being one of the freshest talents available pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts low down dirty shame the nutty professor the problem is of course that there aren many good roles available for siyah women take away the likes of waiting to exhale set it off soul food and eve bayou and all that left is chance to be someone girlfriend local whore or murder victim as result for pinkett smith first opportunity atop the marquee she is stuck in stupid formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo actually woo the latest directorial effort from daisy mayer party girl could have been worse than it is the film offers few funny albeit juvenile moments and the on screen relationship between pinkett smith woo and tommy davidson tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags unfortunately huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with triple digit the situations are painfully contrived the main characters are lifted right out of sit coms and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that wondered whether they all participated in some kind of free lobotomy lab experiment woo is spontaneous energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places her latest relationship with testosterone overdosed drug dealer came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear beeper now her transvestite medium friend celestrial girlina predicts that she about to meet mr right and that he ll be virgo later that day woo is given an opportunity to go out on blind date with tim shy man with penchant for neatness and order who just happens to be virgo it not love at first sight however things get off to rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass and they get even worse when the pair arrives at swanky restaurant to enjoy quiet dinner in the one hundred year history of motion pictures there have been ton of bad beyaz movies about mismatched lovers so suppose it only fair that we get siyah effort of the same low caliber as in all romantic comedies we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together the question is are their courtship rituals entertaining in good entry to the genre the audience becomes caught up in the love story no matter how familiar it is in woo the constant reliance upon unfunny moronic humor sinks the project for those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes there huge one in woo involving corvette with broken window that miraculously repairs itself added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top sadly that one of the film most enjoyable sequences and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional despite exuding charm from every pore there little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david johnson script since it misses the mark by so much better name for woo might have been whoops
there is scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been the scene is set in jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944 where one time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets fists stuffed into coat pockets to one side of him residents scavenge for food in the street to the other side german troops beat group of jews jakob however never stops moving it an efficient effective set up for the character who is clearly nobody idea of hero at the outset he is man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them excising his moral peripheral vision the set up is critical because fate will turn jakob into reluctant savior after visit to german commandant office and moment alone with turned on radio jakob learns that russian troops are quite near when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews they become convinced that he must have radio which is punishable offense in the ghetto the good news brings hope to the ghetto the everyday specter of suicide vanishes private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting the ordinary person in question jakob heym is played by robin williams am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his serious roles with every passing year compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams and see how much more mannered he has become or at the very least how much less sensible at choosing material jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions but williams always looks like he struggling _not_ to craft them when he improvises radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10 year old orphan lina hannah taylor gordon he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky oh yes and then there that little girl some viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero fanciful stories for young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful but those scenes aren problematic because they re familiar they re problematic because they re jarring and distracting introducing cutesy relationship into film that shouldn have been about cutesy relationships jakob character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others but there are plenty of others without poor little lina every scene with her feels contrived pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to previously hopeless people it is pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is much grittier production than you might expect from hollywood ized holocaust combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways director peter kassovitz working from jurek becker novel crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople and draws solid performances from armin mueller stahl as once revered doctor and bob balaban as barber drifting into depression there are just too many things going on that prove distracting whether it the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter or williams incongrous presence or sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl jakob the liar deals with too delicate subject for such fumbling and has too compelling central character to waste and after one wonderful early scene you can see the film wasted and fumbled away
first troy beyer wrote the critically panned now she makes her directorial debut writing directing and starring in this sub par film about women talking about sex though not without redeeming qualities this film is bad the basic story follows three single friends jazz beyer lena randi ingerman and michelle paget brewster in their search for love jazz has an idea for local talk show it would feature women talking about sex and dating she and her friends make demo tape of interviews with the women of miami the film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters the fact that they are real provides refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film there are several moments of bad acting corny dialogue and emotional overextension in low budget independent film from first time director these faults can sometimes be forgiven if the screenplay is fresh and solid that is not the case here the script suffers from random plot developments there are four or five of these turns in the plot each one raising the question where did that come from at one point character has lifelong reconciliation with her mother we are supposed to be moved but since the scene is completely un led up to we really don care if she and her mother get along we ve never seen her mother before we never see her again who cares what worse these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy at another point character announces that she can have children apparently this is devastating we wouldn know this because she never talked about having kids before but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her the scene feels like an afterthought its emotion manipulative and shallow these scenes grow worse and worse culminating in an absurd climax two scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that found myself laughing one scene is lover spat between two minor characters the other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax thinking on these scenes it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities but it does first it is original we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups and imagine this film gives me pretty good idea it something don think has been the subject of film second the interviews of the miami women are sincere taken together they form mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners the mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes but each tile is some woman real experience neither the picture of women nor their picture of men is truly representative but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way at some level the stereotypes that emerge can be called true can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their likes dislikes skills and thrills but on the whole it pretty bad and that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting corny dialogue and emotional overextension ll give beyer one more strike and then she out rated almost got an nc 17 for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity
susan granger review of mulholland drive universal focus whatever david lynch is selling not buying from the writer director of mavi velvet and twin peaks comes another dark mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills dazed beautiful brunette laura elena harring emerges and stumbles down hill slipping unobserved into 30s style apartment as the tenant leaves for trip the next morning dewy blonde naomi watts from deep river ontario arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase her aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust meanwhile hotshot director justin theroux whose wife is in bed with the poolman is forced to cast certain actress in his new film and there an assassin mark pellegrino roaming the city the tortuous paths of these various characters and others named cookie coco and cowboy intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because midway through the story lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality leaving huge wad of cash mavi metallic key paralyzed mogul and lot of questions that go unanswered elena harring and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses effectively making the subtle switch the same cannot be said for former dancer ann miller who stiff and self conscious speaking like most lynch players in staccato tones on the granger movie gauge of to 10 mulholland drive is frenzied frustrating originally designed as an episodic tv pilot this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substance is packaged as puzzle with several of the key pieces left out
georges polti once wrote paper called the thirty six dramatic situations in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty six different situations this may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes there nothing new under the sun the faculty the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion there not measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers screenwriter kevin williamson of scream credit gives us horror tale set in middle america ohio one eventful fall making use of cast of unusually stock characters williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day style but rather through the back door parasitic aliens take over the faculty of run down high school and soon have infested most of the student body leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day the lack of gusto is the movie major stumbling block even though the genre has seen movies that have lack for quality such as this they ve been saved by an energetic approach this casts more than shadow of doubt on williamson ability who enjoyed success with the wes craven directed scream but couldn pull anything solid in for this outing or know what you did last summer although he designs the faculty with more of sci fi bent than his typical slasher picture it still comes down to the same results throw the stock characters in steel cage match and see who comes out alive on that level the main roles are played by virtual unknowns only the recognizeable elijah wood deep impact is at the front other than that the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up and comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved but to do that they all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty la dawson creek needless to say the acting is far from top notch nor does necessity ask that it should be there is moment or two of genuine horror but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci fi direction to make any use of it in sum the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off
spice world is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls sure there hint of humor in there every once in while actually there couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls but overall who cares not me if you don know by now the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power yet dress like streetwalkers from lower middle class neighborhood in spice world they ride around in their big tour bus whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews amazingly all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things things they want to do not things they are required to do to keep earning money and they keep babbling about girl power when they should really be talking about cleavage power mean if all it takes is girl power then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits the film is pg but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions you have yourself one raunchy adult film by the way there something in the opening credits which says based on an idea by the spice girls wow they got idea credit certainly wish that was new trend in hollywood giving credit for simply having the thought say girls let make movie the supporting cast fares well roger moore the real james bond mockingly plays the cliche spewing chief of the spice girls and darn it all he fun to watch mark mckenney also is good as screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the band manager richard grant one question though george wendt you think that spice world would envoke one of two reactions in people if you like the spice girls you ll like them even more afterwards and if you can stand them like me then spice world will really make you sick oddly the audience saw the film with roughly 50 twelve year old girls sat in silence for the entire film well not the two who sat directly behind me they kept muttering this is stupid over and over again maybe there is hope for humanity after all [pg]
read the new yorker magazine and enjoy some of their really in depth articles about some incident they will take some incident like the investigation of mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail it becomes real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested and what kind of pressure the investigators are under and just about any other aspect you can think of frequently get the feeling that the article sounded exciting but am being told in more detail than really wanted to know often get to the middle of story and say ok it sounded good but now have invested more time than am willing to spend on this subject film is different medium it is visual medium that slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize frequently am surprised to find out how short film script is and how much of the pages are empty space the magazine article and the film script are two very different media the insider is film adaptation of the vanity fair article the man who knew too much by marie brenner it is too much an adaptation of magazine article slowed to the pace of film it really verges on being tedious at least at times for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused host of unhealthy side effects but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco the tide turned when former vice president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking the resulting pressure to stop the story created small civil war at cbs who were the major people involved what were their motives how was the story almost killed how did it get aired anyway that is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider this all could have been enthralling but it is not the sort of thing that stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well and in the end he failed to make long story short the film needed director who knew how to make long story short the film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview terrorist we get taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace played by christopher plummer there the news team under producer lowell bergman al pacino are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists we have wry irony on who really has clout in the world terrorists can grab the headlines but the tobacco companies have the real position of power incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand russell crowe dejectedly returning from work to his home we discover that he has been fired and his career brought to complete halt unexpectedly he had been very profitably rewarded vice president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family rather than support him his wife liane diane venora demands of him what are they supposed to do for income meanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand they offer wigand $12 000 just to interpret the data wigand severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms he is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman in spite of the secrecy wigand former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role and so the game begins wigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer meanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family the film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants wigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out he and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost legal fight al pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider the story is told slowly and in just bit too much meticulous detail the film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience the musical score by pieter bourke lisa gerrard and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory it puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling also disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace plummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly this film might have been really engaging experience under another director control michael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style rate it on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale
should have known damn it should have known ewan mcgregor codename eye is pointing high tech rifle ly gadget at fat bald business oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in window across the street we get the requisite electro green through the sight view we the audience seeing high tech rifle ly gadget of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target but instead he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy low quality photographs which eye then proceeds to fax and mail to everyone in his target office all right so thirty seconds in was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle camera but was still open minded maybe there really good reason for it ve got reason to believe you see admire lot of ewan mcgregor previous work and he obi wan ke friggin nobi for god sake and director stephan elliot last movie priscilla queen of the desert was quirky little delight there some genuine talent involved here think at the twenty minute mark there was still spark of hope in my heart eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization son still have no idea what this organization was british intelligence national spy ring private investigation who is apparently stealing from his trust fund he has received his assignment from lang through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase when eye tracks his target to an expensive looking secluded house he witnesses mysterious and beautiful woman ashley judd take knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard ok that odd think to myself this could be interesting then she starts to cry and through her tears exclaims merry christmas dad for the first time so begins our tale of obsession or something the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar throughout his entire professional life he has been voyeur so when he falls for someone the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras fine that lovely premise suppose but gosh darn it if you re going to go there you better have some sort of explanation and that precisely where this film fails this is the kind of movie that pisses me off it an abortion collection of half formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end it pretends it is something that it is not surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in high tech thriller here the filmmakers have confused surreal and deep with vaguely unclear and crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors never even for an instant had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in love with this woman who changes wigs and kills people the movie offers only two explanations neither of which make lick of sense explanation number one the obnoxious presence of eye imaginary daughter who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago tells him he shouldn leave ms judd explanation two which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie beauty is in the eye of the beholder whoo hoo that helps thanks bunch case closed that as deep as it gets folks there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes which instead of tying everything together ends up being as profound as clever sixth grade mad lib there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was my personal favorites include the prison matron modeled after austin powers frau farbissina who apparently taught ms judd everything she knows about wearing wigs jason priestley awfully played dirty desert vagrant #1 who tries to emulate dennis hopper la mavi velvet but fails miserably and the cop who sees ashley fleeing an accident scene and then wants to pay for sex but is shot each one in this sad little parade is little more pointless than the last the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space any time one of the frequent location changes occurs the camera zooms in on souvenir snow globe and minutes weeks or years could have passed bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair one character passes glass of cognac to another in slow motion close up awash in lot of bass ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks then laughs maniacally cut to random guy with eye patch iguana out of focus iguana comes into focus wow man when found out afterward that this film was based on novel it came as no surprise to me there are plenty of elements here that if extended and fleshed out more would have made for decent story and wouldn be surprised if found out there was an hour and half of footage cut from this movie lying in landfill somewhere or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director cut not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such thing to find out what was missing the last ten or so minutes featured conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone and this time didn particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was steaming pile of unholy crap the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what was thinking someone near cell phone guy did eventually yell shut the hell up but it was lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen
as bad as mimic was it definitly scared me mimic continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking foreign director who shows lot of creative ingenuity and style and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make movie director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film cronos that movie worked because it took an unconventional story unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create truly scary movie in mimic del toro doesn bother to give us anything original the plot is stupid combination of aliens meets species meets jurassic park the characters have been recycled from few hundred other movies there nothing new in mimic it just bunch of old tricks that rarely work at the end of the movie you re stuck wanting your money back maybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies he forgot to turn the lights on don understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the seven trend and be set in dark dank areas watching mimic was tempted several times to yell at the screen turn the lights on the switch is to your right use common sense just do it you ll be able to see the monster in the corner there scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off it looked like the light operator was having seizure and sorvino didn even notice she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts hmmm think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight mimic has lot of incidental shock tactics boo just kidding and follows them up with the real scare but nothing in this movie scares you the audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments think they were bored too shouldn blame del toro he isn the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make bad movie hong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time the killer and hard boiled then came to america to make the stupid broken arrow french directors luc besson la femme nikita and george sluizer the vanishing followed woo lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies robert rodriguez who directed the terrific low budget el mariachi came to hollywood and directed the horrible high budget desperado don know why foreign director who shows such talent in his country can make good american movie woo finally broke through and made face off but it still isn up to par with his earlier films get the feeling hollywood producer sits in his office chews on big smelly cigar and says to the director welcome to america bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long do you speak english now know you think you ve made good movies in the past but now you re in america so things are little different here just remember what the american audience always wants and you ll be fine they want to see at least one big breasted woman characters that they ve seen thousand times before because change scares americans and you always need cheesy feel good ending to wrap things up if you don make that kind of movie you ll be shining my shoes in no time
darren jason biggs wayne steve zahn and jack siyah have been best friends since the fifth grade like the three musketeers they ve been together through thick and thin but when darren meets an attractive but cold blooded and manipulative psychiatrist judith amanda peet the long time friendship is placed in danger it up to wayne and to rescue their best friend in saving silverman silverman has its heart in the right place but the story by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darren soul based on their experience of friend making major marital mistake the story is centered on the three life long amigos when wayne introduces darren to judith he doesn realize that he has opened pandora box of disaster for himself and judith was once in relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure until he died in kick boxing match since then she has sought new mate someone she can boss around and mold into her own vision enter darren silverman once they realize the magnitude of their error in judgement wayne and try everything they can including threats and bribery to get judith to free darren nothing works until the duo come up with plan kidnap judith and get darren back together with the girl he called his one and only pretty sandy perkus amanda detmer the only problem here is that sandy is about to take her vows to become nun things spiral out of control as judith repeatedly attempts to escape while wayne and play cupid the boys even bring their idol neil diamond into the picture to help resolve things thinking about it this is real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack siyah the pair is able to elicit the film only laughs with their goofy antics and child like behavior they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne the brains of the gang jack siyah has the big guy moves of chris farley giving an amusing physical presence the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material the rest of the cast doesn fare as well though jason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers and gets very little to do though having watched his previous films american pie and loser not sure what attraction biggs actually has amanda peet is caustic as the manipulative judith there is no humanity at all to her character as she single mindedly strives to recreate darren into her mind image she monster that wayne and must defeat to save their friend unfortunately there is no dimension to her character amanda detmer brings nothing or gets nothing as darren one and only lee ermey as the psychotic coach made bad decision taking this role tune meister neil diamond gives good natured cameo perf as the boys idol and savior production values are on par with the rest of the film lackluster and non involving director dennis dugan has track record for broad comedy with films like big daddy and beverly hills ninja but falls flat with saving silverman the 2001 movie year has yet to provide us with good film to sink our teeth into at least with saving silverman we get couple of funny perfs from zahn and siyah too bad that the rest of the film lacks their level of humor kick boxing deaths and conflicted nuns are not the makings of good comedy give it

synopsis blond criminal psychologist sarah chooses to copulate with greasy tony the mysterious puerto rican rather than bearded cliff the wisecracking neighbor upstairs in the meantime someone sends sarah rotting flowers puts her name in the newspaper obituary column and kills her cat comments never talk to strangers colossal waste of time moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at conclusion which should be obvious to the audience 20 minutes into the film one wouldn think that two genuine movie stars antonio banderas evita and rebecca de mornay hand that rocks the cradle and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller saturday night live would be involved in such celluloid backfire as this turkey not only are they in it however but de mornay executive produced it what was she thinking never talk to strangers centers upon sarah psychologist examining the ill tempered max murderer soon to stand trial she receives sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy in her early childhood two men woo her tony the security consultant wins her over so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music lot of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality disorder but the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd and sarah and instead offers several male characters as kirmizi herrings 86 minutes the running time of this cinematic mess thus seem like 86 hours good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah and tony why would the career minded professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with siyah hat called tony that one of the film mysteries which are never answered regardless of motive de mornay and banderas strip down and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism they also manage to go out before copulating occasionally in one of the stupidest scenes of the film tony takes sarah to carnival that right outside his dingy apartment that way they can hurry back and have sex quickly also apparently the weather changes quickly in their locale they re at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex the next day they re out playing in the snow before having sex the filmmakers attempt to produce suspenseful plot interspersed with tony and sarah character development someone is out to get poor sarah though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this starts rotting flowers writeup in the obituary and beaten neighbor are just few of the bad things which happen to her suspense cliche number one also occurs whenever someone is stalked in thrillers by any means if the stalked has pet that pet will die oftentimes to even further the cliche the murdered pet is cat suspense filmmakers for some reason just don like cats sarah in never talk to strangers receives package and lo and behold discovers her mutilated cat within suspense at its very derivative as stated before never talk to strangers is poor excuse for film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting banderas and de mornay bodies as often as possible comedian dennis miller is completely wasted here he not given lines that are suitable for his persona and doesn even appear all that much maybe in way he lucky for that early on in the movie sarah tells tony after meeting him in supermarket that she had been advised to never talk to strangers allow me to advise that you never watch this stinker
sensuous romantic comedy about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out its the kind of stuff ve seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen lope cruz who plays brazilian chef with magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot but who can get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story pen lope was wonderful in pedro almod var all about my mother but here she is so visible in such stale story where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking that she somehow looks ridiculous as if she got egg all over her face the best you can say about her is that she not to blame for this picture being so off this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex is in my opinion worst than raunchy film that delivers what it says it will the story is all about the love motion sickness and cooking ability of isabella cruz who is born in bahia brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents cook to cure her motion sickness her parents tried every remedy until they went to spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure she is able to control it now as long as she doesn drive car ride elevators follow in dancing and is the woman on top when making love in other words she has to be in control of things in her small fishing town she falls in love with handsome macho latin waiter toninho oliveira murilo ben cio and marries him they open up successful restaurant where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it even though he loafer one night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco we don see her in flight so can tell how she handled her motion sickness problem unless she flew the plane she visits her friend apartment monica harold perrineau jr who is cross dresser blending right into the san francisco scene to cast away her love for the irresistible toninho she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell freeing her from ever loving him again her luck changes when local tv producer cliff mark feurerstein gets whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show you can really write the script from here on by yourself as the despondent toninho begins to realize what good thing he had but things continue to go bad for him there is curse he caused on the fishing in his village there is no chef to replace his wife as the restaurant is about to close for good so he comes to san francisco figuring he can charm her again he brings along with him his guitar playing musicians the ones he used when courting her when he serenaded her under her window he sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick the yuppie tv producer chasing after her and sees that she is no longer charmed by him when he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her the ratings go up and he hired as regular on the show the show gets so big that the network honchos come onboard taking it national but they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show get rid of monica because he freak have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses and they change her ethnic dresses to low cut vanna beyaz type of sexy dresses cliff her would be boyfriend acts creepy and sides with the network big shots even though he loved everything she did these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos they were revolting it was an insult to one intelligence sure that not spoiling the ending for anyone when tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up meal that breaks her spell of loving him again if the film wasn terrible enough monica and cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers it was so awkwardly done that it had no sense of truth or humor to it this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film because it doesn look or feel like an almod var film the type of film it aspired to be but more like film that was interferred with from above its more like futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic as it searches for box office heaven
let me just start this review off by saying am huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years am not too fond of ted turner world championship wrestling however and am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for wrestling movie tonight the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs david arquette aptly cast as neandrathal and sean dawkins scott caan who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than flashy show when they finally get to see their hero wcw world champion jimmy king played by oliver platt personally would have gotten wrestler to play king he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair wasted palitaliano in role originally meant for real life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it they embark on quest to find him and help him get his title back when they find him they discover in horror that jimmy king real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv king is drunken atlanta native rather than an english king after convincing king that they don care that his persona isn real gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro after which sinclair agrees to book him in main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw pay per view gee whiz there are so many things wrong with this movie don know where to begin yes do the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff wcw president who thought up this project thinks of wrestling fans he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously got news for you eric nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that this is 2000 you know not 1985 know he ll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn meant to be taken seriously but it is because that how big an ego bischoff has there was documentary made in 1998 wrestling with shadows that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation vince mcmahon screwing bret the hitman hart out of the title this movie storyline is basically comic rip off of that plot with the poor man wayne and garth thrown in eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart the movie main wrestler jimmy king has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age we want bad asses today why make this comedy instead of an emotional rocky style drama know wrestling isn sport but you can still get behind guy who struggles as wrestler and finally makes it in the end in the movie gordie starts up an ill fated romance with nitro girl sasha the lovely rose mcgowan what she sees in that freak marilyn manson ll never understand only to find that she has hospitalized king trainer for sinclair wouldn it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy girl for the bad guy cliche hate that last but certainly not least there was not one single moment in this movie that could not predict would happen nor did laugh once either the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie for these reasons they re the better promotion they have better and younger talent performers and wrestlers they give their fans what they want and don treat them like idiots they re winning the ratings and they re the promotion everybody cares about simply put they could make movie hundred times better and they could do wrestling movie the right way the only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end and if spoiled it for you good saved you from wasting seven dollars
battlefield long boring and just plain stupid battlefield earth film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman in my mid teen years had horrendous re occurring nightmare behind the wheel of car was driving down straight road in the middle of desert no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway no matter what did the view didn change travelling but not getting anywhere each time awoke in sweat terrified you don have to be carl jung to understand that dream powerless to make changes trapped in boring situation with no hope of rescue this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after battlefield earth begins for all of its flash and style ron hubbard science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000 dull and stupid in the year 3000 the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 000 years humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians there no hope the future is bleak then the psychlo make mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler barry pepper who organizes revolution against chief of security terl john travolta and the alien race it an archetypal post apocalyptic plot full of promise considering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen it difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably but it does the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits are we really supposed to believe that after millennium of looking for altin the psychlo never discovered fort knox or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time and gassed up or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don notice that their slaves are missing for days travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he worth and is almost entertaining almost the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person man animal or not would ever utter some of the film _looks_ good but it also looks so familiar race of large hulking ape like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin sound like something charlton heston might be in the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from dune the final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their high tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with it too loud it too oppressive it too slow it too long far too long and on it goes the list of the problems with battlefield earth is endless it difficult to find anything in the film that does work oh yeah the color scheme is nice the real question is how this movie ever got made could it have something to do with the fact that ron hubbard was the founder of scientology and that john travolta is member of the church that might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago but it doesn give us clue as to why first time screenwriter corey mandell atrocious script was used or why the high profile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed major film or why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems the one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costner the postman which begrudgingly admit as guilty pleasure be the big budget science fiction failure battlefield earth has the honor sewed up often reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video that not the case here you can act now and make the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one don hesitate strike now while the iron is cold
hey ve got great idea for movie ok here it is we ll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so what that sounds too boring ok how about this then we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours but half of them are angry looks and half of them are in pain looks what that that still doesn sound funny to you how about if we through in some ewwwww looks still not funny if you answered no that doesn sound funny then ding ding ding you re absolutely correct for richer or poorer is moronic farce about rich married couple played by tim allen and kirstie alley who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant wayne knight best know as newman on tv seinfeld gets them in trouble for tax evasion what ensues is badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell what makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs namely talent backing up the married couple is brad and caroline sexton allen and alley popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else but in reality are on the brink of divorce just as their marriage seems to be hanging from it final thread brad discovers that his accountant bob lachman knight has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton names the irs catches on but since everything points back to the sexton and not lachman there is nothing much to do except run away and join an amish community first time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us couple of chuckle out loud moments and even some decent laughs here and way over there but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you ll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn alley is absolutely unwatchable and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade which inform you was total allen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons nor are they very convincing as an amish couple this entire movie is one bad ill conceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning the amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing it such trite stereotypical script that imagine the actors that were cast noticing that they re all predominantly tv figures were probably the only ones they could get bryan spicer directing doesn help one bit either in fact listing spicer filmography which includes the first power rangers movie and the big screen adaption of mchale navy is more of an insult than sum now that ve pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground will let you in on the best thing about it it bumped seven films up notch on my worst of 1997 movie list that right thanks to this film ranking at number for the year worst six films are now not seemingly as bad and smile like yours previously inhabiting the number ten spot now doesn have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list if you look at it in that respect for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all
even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material as this subpar submarine comedy proves down periscope stars kelsey frasier grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of corrupt officer james coburn plan to get him out of the navy like any lame emsemble comedy the officer assigns him to group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out the fat guy who eats all the time the beautiful woman who doesn belong there lauren holly the second in command who does everything by the book rob schneider the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out harry dean stanton and so on then comes the transparent plotline first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him and that comes courtesy sad sight gag montage that includes guy with mop knocking schneider overboard after the ship is fixed up come the early drills where everyone seems completely inept like the electrician who can connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone finally and this covers the final hour of the movie grammer has to lead his men and holly to overcome the other ships in wargames exercise and he has to be clever rebel to do it in scenes that stretch all levels of believability first they re singing louie louie like bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off then thirty minutes later they re making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off the whole while evil captain coburn is overacting underwater cursing grammer as most people watching the movie probably are too it all predictable without any original humor to redeem it the jokes are right out of mchale navy and other cut rate sitcoms of the past there one scene where schneider looks through the ship pantry in disgust holds one food can up and announces this expired in 1966 yelled back at the screen so did these jokes watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and around the start of the second hour started writing my will the blame can really be placed on the stars though kelsey grammer is good in this he just doesn have anything to work with his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had welcome aboard tatooed on his penis grammer probably did something even worse got really drunk and agreed to appear in movie he knew nothing about same for holley save the penis part who is likeable in down periscope just because she so gorgeous as for schneider whose character is downright annoying there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas although he still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the snl ship my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as formula comedy okay it police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber and after everyone was signed on turned into disaster judging from the video box most other movie critics agree with me the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel jim ferguson guess even jeff craig from 60 second preview who said tank girl kicks butt without ever seeing it didn like this
movies don come much more ridiculously titled than still know what you did last summer but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous the title sort of works as warning more than silly sounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor this horror sequel moniker also contains grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot what you did _last_ summer you actually did the summer _before_ last summer and since knew about it _this_ summer as well as _last_ summer it really illogical to say that _still_ know what you did _last_ summer the filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter still know the longer still know what you did two summers ago or the appropriate stupid people getting hacked to bits that last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart for example if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet even if it was just to locate and borrow cute little dress probably not but that precisely what college student karla pop diva brandy does to best friend julie jennifer love hewitt resulting in the first in long line of phony frights julie you ll recall was one of the sole survivors at the end of 1997 surprise hit know what you did last summer after slasher with grudge to bear it _long_ story began trying to pick off her her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village in this installment the plot picks up as karla wins trip to the bahamas and julie yet racked by guilt decides that maybe tropical getaway will help ease her mind yeah right their island paradise has room of course for one more in the form of the still alive killer muse watson from the first film he sports the same gorton fisherman get up heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity but why he still trying to stay anonymous is mystery this movie never solves though suppose his hook hand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of leisure suit in sense that the movie glaring flaw everybody knows who the bad guy is thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel the murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary but trey callaway derivative still know screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims when julie lays blissfully unaware in tanning bed giving him perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all what does he do he twist ties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays you think he want her gutted now instead of skin cancer victim later even prequel summer lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and few neat shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh the innovative gallows humor that scribe and scream wunderkind kevin williamson injected into know unfolding story is sorely missed replaced with the grating antics of beyaz rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like yo you ll cheer not shriek when he ends up with pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest if know what you did last summer however effective was just the kind of movie that those subversive scream flicks poked fun at then the deadly still know what you did last summer deserves full blown roasting on mystery science theatre 3000
you should have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following the odd couple ii sneak preview they were as happy group of men as ve ever encountered what great movie exclaimed one gent at the urinal everything was so true yeah laughed man standing next to him drive as slow as that one guy did my kids give me holy hell for it and peeing is big part of my day just like with felix chuckled another fellow as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples and prepared to rejoin his wife if you re over 60 and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour below the posted speed limit neil simon the odd couple ii may be just the film for you others will likely be less charitable while the odd couple ii is amiable enough neil simon shockingly lazy screenplay feels like slapped together tv reunion show suffering from wheezing situation comedy set ups and jokes straight out of the borscht belt simon once the toast of broadway has apparently shifted his sights from the great beyaz way to the neighborhood multiplex in branson missouri the contrived story involving the marriage of their kids provides the excuse for reunion between oscar madison and felix unger who haven seen each other in 17 years the former roommates fly into california from their respective homes for the wedding and quite literally run into one another at the airport they take off in rental car for the ceremony in san molina get lost and have series of wacky adventures on the road jack lemmon and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak and oscar the slob while there is an undeniable chemistry between the pair the impact of their reunion is lessened by the fact that they ve headlined three films together since 1993 grumpy old men grumpier old men and out to sea still the two veteran actors are fun to watch matthau whose magnificently rumpled face looks like big pile of laundry with eyes has field day as oscar the crown prince of the curmudgeons lemmon looking pastier than usual is fine as the ever annoying felix who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional allergic honks of phnah phnah despite their bickering the characters have real affection for each other providing welcome respite from the non stop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films together unfortunately matthau and lemmon charm isn enough to compensate for simon hack script which wouldn pass muster even on upn sitcom one contrived situation follows another lathered with enough stale one liners to supply dozen would be comics on open mike night at the local comedy club if someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as was try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements burger king gets one as does the el pollo loco taco joint but budget rent car really hits the jackpot between script references to their business and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name couldn keep count of all the plugs did however keep track of some of the swearing came up with four god damns three shitheads and two fucks the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for film aimed at an older audience but the theater full of seniors appeared to have no problem with them howling like crazy every time the boys let rip with naughty word it sad that writer of neil simon stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise one running gag involves oscar and felix inability to remember the name of the town where the wedding is to be held at one point the men actually spend 30 seconds just free associating riffing off variants of the word san the sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simply embarrassing one of the oldest maxims of film going is beware of movies that use the author name in the title neil simon the odd couple ii is no exception to the rule while the production has enough minor pleasures to warrant tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon it has no business playing in movie theater of course there bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree with every word ve written and would probably whip my young whippersnapper ass to boot one thing for sure though they ll never catch me in car chase
the army comedy genre has never turned out truly good movie if you don count neil simon biloxi blues year after year more predictably cliched military movies come out most recently sgt bilko and none of them ever manage to be anything more than rehash of the last thought stripes would be different with ivan reitman as director bill murray as star and harold ramis as co star and co screenwriter it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army instead it was bunch of unfunny crap in the army murray about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs plays loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him so he does and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell head shaving and marching singing sequences more mind numbingly stale here than ever the characters are even less original ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette all the big name stars in stripes and even larroquette fall victim to the lame rehashed material and are never really likeable murray in particular he only gets few decent lines in although those barely funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters he was even better in caddyshack for crying out loud as with lot of the late 70 early 80 comedies stripes is completely juvenile movie only child would like but is so sex obsessed no child should be able to watch it sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition dear god every few seconds stripes isn the playful kind of sex comedy either most of the time it seems downright misogynistic as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women showers or murray lifts female onto the stove and with an know what you like look on his face says he going to give her the aunt jemima treatment which means shoving spatula under her butt repeatedly you don want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region not enjoying this the woman protests my sentiments exactly
mercury rising has numerous flaws but there is one that really stands out its central plot device is unnecessary that right the major aspect of the film that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy action flicks could be dropped from the beginning and the movie would turn out exactly the same if not better this central device is the fact that nine year old boy is autistic his name is simon and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow alec baldwin wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked supersecret government code slipped into the back of puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film and we are supposed to feel for him because he is poor handicapped child thrown into violent unfair world against his will with only renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of mercury rising suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon character and his relationship with willis but here it is lost miko hughes the young actor who plays simon goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic he walks slowly drawls his words kicks and screams when he touched and has hard time looking at other people it difficult role for an adult much less young child to play and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn playing like he autistic unlike dustin hoffman performance in rain man or leonardo dicaprio in what eating gilbert grape we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting however unlike rain man which used its character autism in unique and interesting ways to build credible and touching story mercury rising could go right about its generic predictable plot with simon being simply really smart but really shy kid hell he doesn even have to be shy in fact the movie might have been more interesting if he had had more active role rather than just being carted around under willis arm willis character art jeffries is disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything he becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out murder scene at simon house where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide of course we know that isn the way it happened happen because we saw an evil square jawed government hitman with mean looking crew cut knock off the parents simon was able to get away and jeffries finds him hiding in secret compartment in closet which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked jeffries who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it knows there is something more and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon this is quite task because that same hitman who knocked off simon parents is crawling everywhere attempting to kill simon at the hospital on the highway and every other place he goes late in the movie jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of pretty young woman named stacey kim dickens who he meets at coffee shop of all the hard to believe aspects of the movie this is the worst can believe in the decency of the human heart but stacey character is far too accommodating not only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery she lets him into her apartment at two clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point the movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences but even here mercury rising doesn rise to the challenge the movie was directed by harold becker who has made some good suspense films including sea of love 1989 and malice 1993 but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion there is one fight on streetcar between jeffries and another hitman played by peter stormare that is so ineptly directed shot and edited that had no idea exactly where they were on the streetcar who was hitting who and where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were the grand finale takes place on the roof of tall building and features harrowing yawn scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building not because he has to but because it more suspenseful that way taken as whole mercury rising is an tepid confused movie that lacks style wit and any traces of sense of humor usually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles but here he is too straight and serious this is because the movie wants to be an action flick and heartfelt drama at the same time but it ends up failing on both fronts maybe the book was better but the way it handled here is perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore
have never been star trek fan and to tell the truth out of the five films in the series that have seen have disliked all of them do however always go into one of these with an open mind and the ninth film in the series star trek insurrection is no exception dropping almost completely the hard core sci fi element of the previous one in the series first contact insurrection tells the story of planet that holds only 600 people known as the ba ku as well as the fountain of youth at the start of the picture the villagers go under attack by second alien species known as the son who want to push all of the ba ku out so that their own race will not die out also attacking the ba ku is data brent spiner robot from the star trek enterprise after returning to jean luc picard patrick stewart and the gang on their space ship no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force so several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the ba ku where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants sultry kind alien woman donna murphy who is over six hundred years old but looks to only be in her thirties star trek insurrection is completely unoriginal and cheap looking installment in the series and is big step down from 1996 first contact which at least appeared to try to make something bit different in insurrection however it plays like low rent episode of the television show due to the small scale generic storyline and an emphasis on one liners rather than excitement the film was filled with nearly non stop comedy and worse yet most of it fell flatter than cartoon character that drops off cliff meanwhile when there were action sequences they were not at all interesting or inventive relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very very slowly this plot device which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays is getting old fast are filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have timer ticking away during the climax another element of star trek films in general is that picard seems to always have to have love interest but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later although donna murphy who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103 minute running time alfre woodard was far superior in first contact she should have returned for this one but don blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movie disappointing and often lifeless screenplay by michael piller star trek insurrection is perhaps the weakest film in the star trek series although have not seen what is widely considered the worst star trek the final frontier insurrection is the type of safe sequel that will bewilder non fans since it is so low tech compared to most of today blockbuster action films although most of these are honestly not very good either and should disappoint the loyal trekkies since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through few more drafts on second thought they probably should have completely thrown the script out that way they could have come up with story that at least had sign of intelligence and freshness
while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation we had yet another shoddy subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks and once again we have one of the worst films of the year the trend of the moment and bear in mind it trend not movie is spawn and if you ve seen the animated series on hbo you ll recall it embodies the lost life of disfigured man an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment he been sent to hell todd mcfarlane the creator of the spawn comic book must have had tough time sitting through spawn for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects style over substance ambience over anything else not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects the story about bewildered individual who must take on group of bad guys and find himself in the process is realized in such sordid incapable manner it becomes indigestible after while every character in this film is lifeless vacuous and seemingly written by depressed college student the story begins like in every superhero movie in this age with man living an idyllic life al simmons michael jai beyaz government agent assassin shares the love of his wife wanda theresa russell and daughter has tongue in cheek wiseass partner terry sweeney and is content with the job his boss jason wynn martin sheen provides him the next element in the film is the part when things go awry and as expected everyone turns the tables on poor al as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant al is befriended by jason and dies in gory and truly sickening scene inevitably it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away hence jason mischievous master mind plan to conquer the world is just commencing its initial stages when al makes pact with satan himself agreeing to command the devil army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again so our pal al has been uplifted to hell and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place his ol partner terry forms relationship with his wife time passes and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city the ghetto where cog nicol williamson teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts his motorbike armor etc this character is merely poor man obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla now the stage is set spawn the new `enemy of evil vs evil and evil takes the cake doubtlessly john leguizamo deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film relief point all this anguish pain half baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo who steals the show and derives joy from his character which is basically compilation of so so one liners and then there martin sheen whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent as the megalomaniac boss his caricature plays like bad dream out of movie scrambled and left in the shelf to rot this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street never thought be saying this but at this juncture charlie sheen career is in better shape spawn is movie in which realism or even an attempt to draw parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable for most of the film the vapid michael jai beyaz consumes his time ogling jumping through roofs and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better it constantly reminded us we were watching superhero movie very bad superhero movie continually the film kept on depending on special effects and sadly this is how pictures are being made perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting it is perceptible that director mark dippe attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton batman did touch the desperation of man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act but bruce wayne had human elements to him he was pensive resourceful and had relationships which made our perspective on him equally human the character of al simmons seems to be longing for drastic change as if he fatigued about being normal and as all superheroes batman superman the phantom they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary none of this is present in spawn the fighting sequences are weakly executed the dialogue is penny dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner as an example of this film vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten and then rescued by spawn so our emotions tend to be little more sympathetic admittedly did laugh once in the film and that when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as bum it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature besides blaming large portion of it on the laughable school system condemn the other part to garbage like spawn movies that present no admiration no captivation no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to and kids will continue to see films like spawn simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one children are not muppets and spawn unapologetically targets children
it not bad thing to update old stories it done all the time in the oral tradition the difficulty with this film is not that the tale has changed it that it dry the new cinderella danielle drew barrymore is not sitting around waiting for her prince to come she woman of the late twentieth century albeit situated in sixteenth century france when her father dies she stays on in his house even though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla anjelica huston she works by day but reads sir thomas more by firelight at night although the story is updated you know the plot danielle meets prince henry dougray scott goes to ball disguised is later found out and they live happily ever after the movie is often like watching filmed play theater in real life is engrossing theater on the screen is usually lifeless there doesn seem to be much going on the camera can be star of films here it co conspirator danielle convictions are compromised socialist and feminist she pretends to be royalty to get her man kind woman her last act in the movie is one of revenge the most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish the fairy godmother stand in leonardo da vinci patrick godfrey is fun to watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle huston is enjoyable in her over the top wickedness in all fairness my companion loved the film maybe it one of those chick flicks that men don like it is certainly date film nearly the entire audience was couples oh well maybe it good for something
if there were subject just screaming to be made into film it was studio 54 the late steve rubell infamous new york discotheque which came to symbolize the taboo smashing excesses of the disco era heyday easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone all set to thumping dance beat so when miramax started production on _54_ last year the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began an edgy film as down and dirty as the club itself written and directed by promising first timer mark christopher and starring some hot young talent salma hayek neve campbell newcomer ryan phillippe and mike myers in his dramatic debut my how easily does the worm turn hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th hour reshoots wrapped only month ago rash of studio imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew especially christopher unhappy and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics at the last minute though miramax did decide to screen the film so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers last name was misspelled on the invitation not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes for media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed myself included and with good reason somehow some way the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism boring although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_ lifelessness _54_ focuses for the most part on tight knit trio of employees at the club coat check girl aspiring disco diva anita wasted hayek her busboy husband greg breckin meyer and most prominently the fresh from jersey shane shea phillippe who enjoys quick rise from busboy to head bartender these characters are about as generic as those descriptions in focusing on the hired help christopher really missed the boat with the exception of the flamboyant always woozy rubell myers in well modulated turn the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers but those of the people who went there to party not necessarily the numerous vip guests but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club famously hard ass doormen and dance among other things the night away with the rich famous and infamous the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow feisty dottie disco and drug crazed granny but she peripheral character at best as such aside from the expected overhead crowd shots there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ what is disco film especially one about the pinnacle of the movement without the dancing even whit stillman _the_last_days_of_disco_ which wasn so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within group of hip to only themselves club hopping preppies featured at least one extended dance scene dancing isn the only thing glazed over in _54_ so is the sex but that may not be entirely christopher fault from what ve heard his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring starting with the shane character he was conceived and actually filmed as wild morally ambiguous bisexual which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54 legend but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out consequently so was the film aside from brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film shane fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie sela ward and an abbreviated bedhopping montage the sexual dimension is just about ignored shane in this incarnation is sanitized to the point of blandness an idealistic do gooder who pines for frequent guest at the club julie siyah campbell worldly soap star with yes heart of altin this tacked on romance would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience they fail on both counts ultimately _54_ failure comes down to three letters as in there isn any to be had for the audience too much time is spent with the boring shane and too little is spent on the club floor where all the action took place anyhow though whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club it should be euphoric height for her the crowd and the audience however the moment doesn get chance to reach that level for it is cut short by moment of forced sentimentality which also mars the film conclusion one of the last minute reshoots strangely upbeat and wistful the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there two of them in fact but _54_ is not one of them they re on cable tv couple of documentaries produced by and vh1 these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings on within it show that there still great disco movie to be made the problem is after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ the subject may have run its hollywood course
hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city the lawyer kevin lomax keanu reeves is not offered job yet he is asked to simply pick jury he accepts the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered job with the firm making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money but gorgeous apartment he convinces his wife mary ann charlize theron to make the move to new york the first case given to him is big test winless case concerning man who sacrifices animals in his basement the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal his new boss and partner in the firm john milton al pacino is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing explaining many of his philosophies on law women and sex and angles the promise of blissful wealthy life kevin next case is dream case given to him by milton himself much to the chagrin to his colleagues defending triple murder suspect who has had history of problems with the law although kevin career is taking off his home life is not doing very well mary ann is starting to have numerous problems she is experiencing severe depression over kevin long hours and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls their faces becoming horribly disfigured kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with then focus all of his attention on his wife not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about possible affair with sexy lawyer connie nielson also working with the firm mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife and gets disturbing news from his mother judith ivey about the mystery concerning the identity of his father he also starts to lose control of his case kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man that man is his boss mr milton truly evil character who just may be the devil himself kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store but how do you defeat the devil why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd do filmmakers really believe that normal courtroom drama doesn fit the bill and they have to juice them up the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in real courtroom which wouldn have been too bad if it weren keanu reeves trying to pull it off give reeves credit for trying hard but throughout the movie never saw the kevin lomax character just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short charlize theron defines the term over the top in her performance as mary ann lomax disappointment in contrast to her good performance in days in the valley the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino but kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil and you can tell he is having fun doing so but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him it pretty standard stuff including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled but have to get something off of my chest in 1986 remember watching movie called wisdom with emilio estevez and demi moore and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that movie could do what like to call guess what it was all dream scenario in wisdom the two lead characters are killed at the end only to have one of the characters wake up from an apparent and say gosh glad that didn really happen considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with well the same thing happens in the devils advocate and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually dream perhaps milton went back in time to try different route for his plan since it failed and he is the devil but the point is that the last 90% of the film didn happen know it stretch after all it is movie and nothing really happened but just get annoyed to get toyed with like that of course the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one as recall wisdom was decent film the devil advocate is not the devils advocate directed by taylor hackford john milton al pacino kevin lomax keanu reeves mary ann lomax charlize theron mrs lomax judith ivey eddie barzoon jeffrey jones christabella connie nielson written by randy turgeon march 18 1998
the spy game is up you can thank charlie angels the movie for that when did banality and pandering become okay just steal from hong kong the matrix and kitschy tv show from the mid 1970s and that movie charlie angels is one of the worst examples of action film homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film ve seen in ages charlie angels is dumb just plain dumb as we all know three of the hottest females on the planet drew barrymore cameron diaz and lucy liu are three super agents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie they all drive fast cars look oh so fabulous even in the morning and don seem to get scratch even when fighting armed men having buildings explode ten feet in front of them or flying through the air in matrix slow motion and while the entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavage busting wetsuits cleavage busting waitress uniforms and cleavage busting wet shirts they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as group of annoying drunk sorority girls the kind who hit on everybody at party the actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of millionaire computer engineer the great sam rockwell who gets kidnapped by mysterious rival computer company of course the rival wants control of his new personal identification system which involves such latter day buzzwords as gps cellular tracking and even mainframe the amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to the angels like battling each of them in many round robin matrix rip off again fight sequences and harboring strange attraction to sliced off locks of the angels hair the coup de grace is bill murray as bosley serving as charlie manservant or more to the point the angels pimp the rest of the movie comprises revenge arc enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables carbon copy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to jackie chan and the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft and the strange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourke long lost brother charlie angels starts off with bang and ends up being soggy burrito left out overnight nothing is difficult plausible or believable in any of the angels actions it feels like the matrix mission impossible and cleopatra jones and the casino of altin all rolled into one diaz is knucklehead barrymore is the dangerous one mean and tough and about as believable as katie holmes in the role liu is just lucy liu looking good in skin tight siyah leather suit the list of movies from which charlie angels is directly lifted is equally astonishing the writers apparently ran the copier all night stealing scenes from armageddon lethal weapon ii all of jackie chan movies the great escape saturday night fever revenge of the nerds payback darkman dr no the matrix as mentioned and even tv friends it shame too because one of the many screenwriters john august was at the helm of last year favorite go then again what can you expect from director known solely as mcg there is no camp value in the film no interesting main characters no invigorating action scenes no reason at all to waste your time except to ogle the hot chicks and enjoy the performances of few supporting players note to hollywood next time let leave the tv shows on the tv
have always been fan of director neil jordan from his early work such as 1984 the company of wolves to 1992 the crying game and 1994 interview with vampire his latest film the butcher boy is return to his roots in ireland but unfortunately it is not successful homecoming told through the eyes of 12 year old irish boy francis newcomer eomann owens this peculiar film follows him as we learn little about his decidedly unstable life his father stephen rea is an indifferent alcoholic his mother fiona shaw is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore francis is the type of boy who always has lot to say but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be little psychotic even capable of brutal murder the premise of the butcher boy is one that could have very well been turned into thought provoking disturbing motion picture but somehow nothing works francis is in almost every scene but we learn very little about him as if the film was distancing itself away from him when suspect we were actually supposed to sympathize with him this is definately not young owens fault however because he gives brilliantly accurate performance and is able to also seem menacing as well the fact that we don get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay the supporting characters are no help though rea is wasted and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son or to anyone else for that matter he usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout shaw has little bit more to work with since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in time of despair but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her and singer sinead connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice the pacing is all off in the butcher boy although the story could have been dynamite it moves at deadeningly slow rate and found my mind wandering every once in while it is also very episodic because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs at one point francis is sent away to juvenile prison and an odd possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between priest and himself but nothing comes of it rather think of the butcher boy as brief diversion for director jordan rather than total misfire he has already proven to be strong director but he lucked out with this latest film what could have been courageous unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy only manages to be an ineffective uninvolivng bore
as you should know this summer has been less than memorable with total of decent films it not surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing with that said you can pretty much predict what my opinion on the 13th warrior will be the film is based on the michael crichton eaters of the dead in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at wife of king after tarveling for many months he comes across gang of norsemen who are forced to pick 13 men to protect town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog so they start picking men and are left without thus ahmed is choosen so far it sounds interesting right not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes after that they basically run around killing that alone shows how much script is needed for film because once your story is introduced you have the rest of the film to start developing it obviously that not the case here even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure you will be disappointed since all the action takes place in fog it is constantly hard to see scene clearly due to those circumstances and to poor camera work can the camera men sit still like to actually watch film in focus but again they failed to deliver that as well the film moves on and on until the point where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you re eating with corny dialogue that the characters laugh at for some odd reason script that goes nowhere dull action sequences predictable ending and worst of all weak characters there basically nothing to like here except for maybe the set designs that the only thing that honestly caught my interest when heard that john mctiernan the director wanted his name kept out of the project that made me wonder why well now know crichton greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product which led to big arguement what there to argue about anyway the film couldn be saved no matter how much they spent or casted seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money wouldn be surprised to see the 13th warrior become hit please do me favor and save your money at all costs or else you will be lost in the fog like the film itself
if were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films might say that review movies that don look particularly good because doing service to my readers by warning them against seeing it if that were true could put banner at the top of my site that reads shay casey seeing bad movies so you don have to but know that bunk you re going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what say so have to tell the truth every once in while get nasty masochistic urge to see bad movie you know the feeling when you re sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have ball trashing mercilessly sometimes think that why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies ever admit it sometimes you like seeing bad movies so do so saw supernova truth be told supernova wasn quite as bad as thought it might be maybe just felt sorry for the actors or maybe thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn started tinkering with the director walter hill final cut causing him to want his name removed maybe becoming softy in any case didn find supernova as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe but it still bad the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel nightingale the crew includes captain marley robert forster his new second officer nick vanzant james spader head medical officer kaela evers angela bassett medical technicians yerzy penalosa lou diamond phillips and danika lund robin tunney and computer technician benj sotomejor wilson cruz there are some attempts at characterization but all that means is that nick has shady past involving drug addiction which puts kaela on edge yerzy and danika have relationship that requires them to make kissy faces at each other every five minutes and benj apparently gay is in love with the computer apparently female don expect any more explanation because you won get it anyway the crew gets distress call from location deep in space to which failed mining operation had been sent during the dimension jump think that what it called but don hold me to it the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal peter facinelli is brought on board he calls himself troy larson making him the supposed son of man kaela once had relationship with then bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening have you seen alien have you seen event horizon lame movie in its own right good then you ve seen supernova post production cuts or not there is nothing original about this screenplay and nothing unpredictable either after all no one going to think for second that troy won turn out to be villain but the bigger problem with supernova is that it can just stick to the simple plot it afforded numerous re writes the script may be credited to three people but it gross underestimate have crammed this lean 90 minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped was there something about limping robot shaped like fighter pilot did the ship computer learn something about humanity what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him and just what does the film title signify if anything as far as can tell it refers to very small plot detail that isn developed just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements character relationships in this film also make very little sense for some reason every person in this film keeps having sex we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes bassett and spader characters start off hating each other fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later they re engaging in some hanky panky when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship of course both female crew members will fall in love with him every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut the most prominent example however may be the fact that when the film starts there are no opening credits furthermore the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits maybe that why the film title is mentioned twice during the end credits right between james spader and robert forster right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you re seeing lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of scene with little to no introduction to any of the characters or situations the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes you know where they explain things and just went from point to point point danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby point tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing doesn make sense since didn understand anything about these characters motivations did care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one by one and he does knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes not whit it shame because this cast contains lot of talented actors looking for something to do they don find it bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces sexual tension more like constipation maybe they re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and whole lot less nice not that we ever find out who that is mind you the climax of their relationship taking place in transport pod is probably the film biggest forehead slapper as troy peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected he awfully one note but it not as if he given any more notes to work with the rest of the cast does even less tunney stands around looking cute then scared phillips broods cruz flirts with the computer then they all die and star blows up or something but really wasn paying much attention by then supernova is pretty awful but cutting it little slack merely because expected less than what got that it if you expect it to be good for whatever reasons you may have you ll probably hate it more than will even the special effects are fairly unimpressive nothing you haven seen before and suffice to say the script isn going to save the film honestly though what do you expect from film with about dozen writers and director who had his name removed and replaced with pseudonym it usually results in bad movie and that what supernova is
for timing reasons having to do with baby sitters we recently went to multiplex and saw undercover blues would give it one half of star for guts anyone in movie this bad would have to have guts later read ny times review that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid had gotten so plump they looked like they had the mumps in the show the script was the worst part they had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh they had lots of great sight gags like two people trying to go in door together and therefore bumping shoulders against the door turner and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on game show the good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet and left buy some tickets and give them to your worst enemies tell them the show is great and smile lot one of the top few films of this or any year must see film excellent show look for it average movie kind of enjoyable poor show don waste your money one of the worst films of this or any year totally unbearable review written on september 29 1993 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer
the obvious reason for producing sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits the rationale is sound but in many cases of this and recent years the sequel is shoddy product that exposed for the cash milking vehicle it really is last year speed and scream as well as this year species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory in some cases sequel can even discredit its predecessor as with the latest neo slasher flick still know what you did last summer whatever uniqueness the original might ve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller julie james jennifer love hewitt and ray bronson freddie prinze jr are back from the original to star in still know reprising their roles in typical fashion julie and ray experience rather predictable falling out at the beginning of the movie leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson matthew settle will and julie hit it off and along with friends karla brandy norwood and tyrell mekhi phifer the foursome heads off to radio station giveaway vacation in the tropics unfortunately things aren so peachy once they arrive and with regularity you could set your watch by the infamous fisherman muse watson is back with his hook it another bloody showdown complete with cliffhanger ending there not much that original about still know and with the market saturated by gen thrillers like this one it unlikely that still know will get any recognition other than that of bad sequel for die hard fans of the genre this will be required viewing material but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original know what you did last summer the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn heightened by skillful scripting or camera work but rather tense string based score and manipulative editing the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue he goes from being scary figure to nutcase in few short and painful moments much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point the whole reason the plot exists julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station is dead giveaway lessening suspense and creating hurry up and wait timing problem and whereas the killer identity might ve been question in the first movie it almost given here which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically three or four teens run automatically from man in rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as the killer they re almost used to it and the performances show it not hewitt nor prinze nor brandy nor phifer give decent show and so in the end it left wide open for third movie and most likely brand new supporting cast god help us
dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson work he always finds clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain with teaching mrs tingle his directorial debut williamson has reached the end of his rope what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here the components are all there including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to but where are the thrills the laughs both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge and what shame that is loved the scream films heck even enjoyed the sci fi goofiness of the faculty kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such big draw at the box office teaching mrs tingle siyah comedy that will leave gaping void in his optimistic followers may put an end to his reign or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting script than to worry about his directing duties still have my faith but fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be forgotten echo of the past the title character of his pet project is vicious uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over the top by british actress helen mirren mrs tingle is basically every student worst nightmare heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard working of her pupils the principal michael mckean is horrified of her and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way mirren performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow siyah comedy that goes down like flat soft drink in other words it poor substitute for williamson best work the plot is big problem here material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann an over achiever hoping to get college scholarship but typical mrs tingle says her history project which she worked on for countless hours is laughable later on while studying in the gymnasium classmate barry watson offers her photo copied duplicate of mrs tingle final exam leigh ann best friend marisa coughlan encourages her to use it alas the old hag herself finds the three scheming and snatches the test and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning in the morning how convenient the three students head to mrs tingle house attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann name things get out of hand and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in tussle the plan is to tie her to bed and try to get some reasoning out of her of course not everything goes entirely to plan besides pointless sub plots involving the football coach jeffrey tambor horribly wasted there is little by way of actual progress there is no urgency to the situation little tension or laughs are involved the humor is completely inconsistent after many of the jokes the theater was so silent could have heard fly sneeze you continue to await some momentum in the story something that could possibly revive the slow pace moment like that never arises williamson also does handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players including the talented mckean and larry sanders vet tambor and the beautiful vivica fox has one lifeless scene as caring guidance counselor and then williamson disposes of her character entirely on the plus side holmes and coughlan are admirable with the latter giving frighteningly believable exorcism impression and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as substitute teacher while everything is pretty lifeless teaching mrs tingle remains watchable there are few promising ideas that pop up now and again but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching she is convincingly evil and fun to watch but even her gifted delivery can save individual scenes that flounder in boredom if there is one word for the movie surrounding her it would be `disappointing basically kevin williamson is his worst enemy here his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated not that his writing here is especially good we will see when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas whether williamson is for real
the tagline for this film is some houses are just born bad so didn expect too much from this but had preserved little spark of ope as entered the theatre thought liam neeson cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont thought mabe it will be fun and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing but by the end of it thought why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones jan de bont these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality here is the story in the monstrously over decorated mansion known as hill house visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor liam neeson into being guinea pigs in fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation among them is sophisticated bisexual cathrine zeta jones cynical dope owen wilson and gentle and emotional lady lily taylor actually the doctor is researching the primordial fear reaction and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens but he gets unexpected help from the house itself it rumbles hums and belches forth remarkable sights portals become veiny stained glass eyeballs fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like sinister mouth filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real placing an emotional wall between audience and screen the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture is that exciting or what the worst thing about it is that it didn have to be bad it based on great book ``the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience the blair witch project that cost less than an old car managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses and with $70 mill budget de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of perfectly lovely piece of terror de bont has style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is in itself frightening he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush but why give him more serious material in the end haunting will only haunt its fledgling studio dream works skg and de bont career as director yet it wouldn be fair to say that everything is bad the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated beautiful mysterious magical and spooky but this is where the good things end the music is blaring the floors moving the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming and all of this every second every moment of screen time is absolutely without life it nothing more than special effects extravaganza visually impressive but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn engage at first you do not know what going on is this part of the experiment are these hallucinations projections of the subconscience paranoia but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening the house is actually possessed it is at that point when all your hopes for good entertainment disappears out of the window for ever sat in anticipation for decent climax and that what got believe hichock once said that it better to wait for climax than to see one this may be true and it might actually work but there is only one problem jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary only stupid they are impossible to take seriously any paralells that you might have heard before linking this picture to kubrick the shining are absolutely baseless shining had class style story acting but most of all talent and originality haunting has only special effects and art direction to boast of and those elements alone are not enough to make it good film casting good actors for small pale parts only makes things worse but guess that no matter what or other critics say or write most of you will see this film anyway even if the tagline would say some films are just born stupid
porter stoddard warren beatty is successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie diane keaton for twenty five years they and best friends mona goldie hawn and griffin garry shandling are about to face marital crises in film most well known for its torturous path to the screen town and country town and country has pedigree befitting it title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry the graduate under the direction of peter chelsom funny bones after years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates the media has been prepped for beatty next ishtar so is it that bad the answer is no but it not very good either the major problem with town and country is that it unstructured and random stoddard is immediately established as philanderer having just bedded flaky cellist nastassja kinski next scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin then mona spies griffin hustling redhead into motel and begins divorce proceedings buck henry cameos as both couples divorce lawyer ellie thinks she overeacting but sends porter to support mona on trip to check out her family mississippi manse the two childhood friends end up in bed together making us wonder why they never become couple to begin with back home their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter cheating on her porter goes off on trip with griffin to sun valley idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he gay the four friends along with every woman porter dallied with all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after although the film begins promisingly resembling woody allen take on new york city wasps too many strands drift off into nowhere the stoddard household is huge containing two adult children josh hartnett the virgin suicides and tricia vessey kiss the girls their colorful bedmates and maid who just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of nocturnal snack the six supporting players are dropped except for an out of nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son porter romantic misadventures with women other than mona are equally mishandled once the marital discord begins the film seems as if it was editted with machete stopping and starting never regaining its rhythm while beatty gets off few tart observations his character is mostly passive and bemused maybe we re supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn initiate his own sex romps keaton ellie has trusting nature that result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of the out of towners and the first wives club while shandling relegated to true second banana status kinski is bland and unmotivated andie macdowell takes weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplay most bizarre subplot which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic wheelchair bound foul mouthed mother heston and seldes are fun as is jenna elfman as sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to halloween party oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film nice look but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like hear my song and funny bones the script is this film weakest link it telling that most of the few laughs come from old fashioned physical slapstick and the sight of beatty in bear suit while town and country isn exactly painful to sit through it mostly just lays there
there have been bad films in recent years mr magoo was by far the worst ever made the spectacularly bad blue in the face the horrible baby genuises and now woke up early the day died it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie the film acting if that what you want to call it is well mediocre to me loaded with sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film bit boy was wrong after escaping from mental institution the thief played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty he turns to burglary to survive robs loan back kills the loan officer and runs with thousands country wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down he ends up in cemetery where he puts his money in coffin to keep it for later comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back ultimately leading to finale that is less that satisfying film which was based on long lost script by ed wood have only one question no dialogue only music and movement where exactly is the point the film moves along at rather slow pace but does have one advantage the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some it opens with fun innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that some of the low points are when the thief steals woman purse and then she faints sandra bernhard as dancer and tippi hendren as deaf woman whom the thief kills to the music of psycho come on people get some new ideas already what even worse is that the film has no plot at all well to certain extent it does but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we re bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen woke up early the day died is perfectly bad film it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make movie even with the huge cast talent the film is waste of my time and certainly waste of yours
it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others myself included would pick seven days in may both those films were tense exercises in chills the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man john frankenheimer but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed each of those films had memorable characters and tense plot they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay the thrills all came from the plot ronin is like film made by another man somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot but we see only tiny pieces of it we get clue here and one there as to what is going on but zeik screenplay is bit obscure the film begins explaining that ronin is masterless samurai when samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death he becomes ronin much like gunfighter in the american west if you miss the opening do not worry this film will explain again what ronin is sam played by robert de niro is the modern equivalent of ronin he is free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of professional killer he clearly was in dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france sam is recruited from montmartre bar by dierdre natascha mcelhone of the truman show an irish woman to be part of an action to steal mysterious metal case dierdre is very tight lipped about what is in the case sam joins team of four others vincent jean reno of the professional leon and mission impossible spence sean bean tv richard sharpe and also patriot games and goldeneye and gregor stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting also along is larry skipp suddeth the group seems to know their business particularly sam but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise their only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team the story is not very easy to follow it is never clear who is double crossing whom and who is working for whom somehow russians who may or may not be the russian mafia and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on certain metal case some very good actors are involved in this film one wonders what they saw in the script the characters are mostly one dimensional professional killers they know their work and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed by the end of the film we never really got to know anybody maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts since these are not very demanding characters to create in addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal as revival of sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy unfortunately there are no deep characters and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it rate ronin on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale non spoiler incidentally the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin also one frequently sees in japanese art the image of man breaking down door with huge mallet this is the first blow of the 47 ronin
the main problem with martin lawrence pet project thin line between love and hate like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is man is that his character is an irresponsible jerk and if that is the case it doesn seem to do anything except justify the woman actions that is especially the case in lawrence darnell wright he is one of those macho guys with women lined up mile long now don think condone this just because male my philosophy is if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on beautiful kind girl you should treat her like princess and respect her darnell doesn think like this he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target beautiful wealthy brandi web played nicely by whitfield who runs successful real estate business is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia king found myself thinking supposed to feel sorry for this guy after all it is largely darnell fault if he is lining up all these women you think he have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day as his mother says it does but he doesn so you get the sense that he not only irresponsible but also pretty dumb you especially get this sense that he dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her put my pants on in two seconds after that now brandi is psycho bitch but it hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage one final flaw though is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with brandi is classy intelligent woman with an mba from harvard who initally resists darnell immature play as she calls it as any woman like her would in real life but all of sudden she says yes but when you listen to darnell four letter word vocabulary watch his actions you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for guy like darnell period much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him lawrence can be good when he wants to but in order to prove it he needs to let other people write and direct his movies look at this movie four writers as result it too long two hours when it could ve easily worked at ninety minutes and it has lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came which makes me think the writers didn get along all of which isn necessary there are some bright spots though whitfield regina king della reese and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts and they help it out lot and there are some funny parts like for example the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property but they re just not enough to sustain the film
capsule lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for terminal illness potentially interesting idea made stagy and boring claire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that was waiting for someone to sneeze just to break the ice it perfect example of what my wife calls an movie where means so ing earnest movies like this need wit and brashness to be absorbing claire is one strained speech after another written delivered with all of the energy and spontenaity of dmv clerk claire takes two women claire and noel both writers and throws them together in the same cabin at women only writer retreat claire wrights light comedy while noel is scholarly authority on porn and sexual behavior obviously the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about and for the entire one hundred and twelve insufferable minutes of this movie that all they do talk the movie sets up its microscopic plot with beat dead horse into glue obviousness the evening talks at the camp are chaired by motherly type named maggie self professed lesbian and when noel owns up to also being lesbian claire looks like she been hit with sockful of wet sand the movie then quickly degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance and claire looks out over the water reflectively ugh the most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads all of this of course leads up to scene of complete inevitability claire and noel in scene that should have come an hour earlier because then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about what just happened we never get hint about how any of this has changed anyone only how they felt about things that didn even happen yet the problem with claire is not lesbianism as such but the leaden way it handled why is it that any serious better word would be adult or at least thoughtful examination of sex in movie almost always winds up producing movie that unwatchably boring the way this movie deals with lesbianism we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids many other movies have used the same subject in ways that are thousand times better more engaging more creative more intellectually and artistically interesting look at john sayles lianna or the interesting and little seen desert bloom both of them have more life and vibrancy than claire what this movie needed was good swift kick in the pants
the great actor james woods once said and paraphrasing if sex isn messy then you re not doing it right truly profound statement and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre just replace sex with your mad slasher film for those uninformed souls the mad slasher genre or sub genre is melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of plot that follows an identical outline usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens la halloween urban legend is mad slasher flick but one that is so sanitary bloodless and nudity free that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful though not overly talented cast it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special for film makers gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in stale fright free horror movie as stephen king once said again paraphrasing if you can scare your audience gross em out if you can do that make em laugh alas urban legend succeeds only at the latter though not by intention actually find the fact that this film became minor success $40 million domestic box office gross more frightening than anything in it it seems that audiences tastes have been whittled down to such degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills but how can anyone with three digit iq argue that it provides them unfortunately these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations one idiotic super hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don need to do anything more than promise good time without the added pressure of delivering if anyone disagrees would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin wild wild west and godzilla but forget all that it goes without saying that mad slasher films or any other exploitation off shoot will be made without an ounce of craft especially considering the sheer volume that are produced allow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film the lack of enthusiastic exploitation these flicks aren harnessed with any lofty aspirations so why not break free and give your audience bloody good time sadly out of the literally hundreds made would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while and urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three despite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend setting alone offers myriad of promising possibilities it takes place on college campus which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer you see the campus is community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface all those young people are growing up together going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows so naturally some weirdness is expected all the better for that elusive crazed killer coupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around and the introduction of little exploitation into the proceedings should be relatively easy task but alas urban legend is not only idiotic and clich full it way too clean slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity little gore and much stupidity this is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than dunno exercise it the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses running like the wind prey yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques it the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud noise jump scare thing yes the audience jumps momentarily frightened but wouldn anyone if loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated quiet room lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when caught glimpse of the killer apparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers in scream it was ghost mask scary enough in know what you did last summer it was fisher man rain slicker in the middle of summer no less and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody the villain wears an oversized parka with fury hood ooh scary intended to conceal his her identity for urban legend humbly suggest donald duck costume though must admit urban legend does have winning premise for what could have been somewhat entertaining exploitation film the film killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends you know like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they re coming from inside the house won spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used after all the film does offer fine 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough sad to say it doesn include my favorite urban legend fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and very unhappy gerbil now that would be scary before leave you would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film the first being the lack of craft the second the lack of exploitation its characters all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people ve ever spent an evening with only jared leto looking like carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day and alicia witt as the resilient heroine avoid vexatiousness the most annoying of the bunch is tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum as supremely irritating lout so irritating actually cheered his painful death and am not cruel person ironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film if viewed as vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining after all this is movie that features the kind of faux hipsters can stand getting slaughtered which is at least better than watching an entire film about people can stand not getting slaughtered
the premise of turbulence is sure very familiar to us all we ve seen it before in passenger 57 executive decision and countless other flicks that are good in there own way you know terrorists take over plane ask the police on the ground for what they what and so on turbulence starts out with convict ray liotta being accused of crime you think there is no way he could have done it he so open and kind he is taken in and is subsequently transported on commerical plane to la this is already problem there is no way that convicts would be transported on the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on anyway it is christmas eve and everyone is waiting to get to la and spend christmas eve there well convict one manages to stop the flight in its proverbial tracks and liotta still as calm as ever takes the other convict out he also has eyes for lauren holly flight attendent and seems to grow closer to her the plot stops here didn like this movie because it seemed to be rip off of every other airplane movie ve ever seen at one point mr liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in the shining serious it was like they stole for every other movie down to the only reason did not give this stars is because it had some okay stunts don even bother
movie laced with good blend of action comedy and heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way creating dismal and unsatisfactory product eighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed minus half of its original duo the late john belushi and nearly all of its original charm dan aykroyd reprises his role as well as his co writing credit as elwood blues the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on self proclaimed mission from god along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago as we begin elwood is being released from state penitentiary along with the news of his brother death in prison years ago completely on his own elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away but elwood isn completely without family it seems he has half brother of sorts not real brother mind you just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudo father curtis cab calloway from the first film who has also passed on despite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata kathleen freeman to do otherwise elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band working as police commander cabel chamberlain joe morton has an immediate disliking for elwood who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mother affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet following elwood around is the lonely orphan buster evan bonifant who quickly learns to become mini elwood when bartender mighty mack mcteer john goodman joins the group the blues brothers band is complete and once again the group travels the country crashing cars blowing things up and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock meanwhile cab personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next to next of kin >from this point the movie turns into series of music videos with few bits of acting in between those hoping for an interesting and or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of story only the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours for those people it may be worth it for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting but when the story does intrude upon the festivities the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes musicians turned stiff actors and the pointless 10 year old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin james brown eric clapton and whole slew of others are the high points of the film but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors blues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really really love this kind of music you might kind of sort of like this movie many many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny and if you don have passion for very deep blues rock you ll be bored out of your skull much of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd self serving vanity project but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this none of the excitement is passed on to the audience and seeing three guys in three piece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long unfortunately those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film
here sit at my computer about to write my review of the recent action comedy bait starring jamie foxx and david morse this is review don even want to write because just be laying the same criticisms on it that would with any other so generic and predictable it beyond ridiculous piece of hollywood fluff if they re not going to give us the audience just little credit and put something together with half brain why should waste my time and mental energy criticising it last summer took this same approach with my review of the mummy in that review just quoted phrases my reviews of other sub par movies think shall do the same thing here but with few less quotes not all are applicable hope this goes to show you what think of bait and why you can find out all you need to know about it without having to take wild guess it genuinely unfunny and the other audience members only laughed once during the entire two hours unoriginal and unthrilling it not so bad to the point where it fun to watch because of its badness and it no so bad you absolute loathe it and are pained by watching it it just such cliche in and of itself that uhh lost my train of thought anyways here those quotes enjoy getting an audience attention right from the beginning plays major role in how today films work we want to have something exciting to watch not slow build up of story god forbid and this film plays right into the mainstream hands review of armageddon it clear the film doesn want to waste time on reality and thus the attempt to establish plausability the most minimal amount necessary comes across as half assed effort supporting characters and shady sup plots are introduced but as is the case with films made up of large cast of characters only handful have any real significance there fine line separating homage from plagiarism review of godzilla 1998 unfortunately as is the case with most modern thrillers once the film showed potential for authenticity and intelligence the cliches and action sequences take over review of the jackal chad movie page is back after heavy renovation reviews of nearly all mainstream movies playing today get my reviews of everything playing at your local cineplex so you can better make an informed decision on what to see don forget to vote on my poll and sign the guestbook
tv buffy finds herself on the other side of the supernatural spectrum in simply irresistible sarah michelle gellar that never ceasing crusader against never ending evil every tuesday night on the wb network here plays down on her luck chef suspected of dabbling in witchcraft after her flailing restaurant receives help in the form of magically scrumptious meals taste test results some vampire slaying though out of place would have really livened this excruciating movie up simply irresistible is actually quite easy to deny disaster of culinary and other proportions pretty much from the opening on gellar amanda finds herself falling for harried henri bendel exec tom sean patrick flannery of powder around the same time she discovers an uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking secret ingredient that arouses both his interest in her and the public in her tiny tribeca eatery all this love and sorcery have lot to do with the telekinetic crab that also figures into the story tale that at times plays like an american spin on 1993 mexican classic like water for chocolate several differences one like water didn have telekinetic crab and two like water was good film simply irresistible on the other hand is about as challenging as an easy bake oven amateurishly staged scenes cancel each other out in their badness from an embarrassing seduction in literal vanilla fog to an impromptu dance sequence where tom and amanda do their best fred and ginger though fred and ginger never took part in anything this garish the intrusive musical score distracts from the flat dialogue at regular intervals but it not like you re were going to miss much in fact take away the few instances of salty language and this has made for disney channel written all over it but majority of simply irresistible resistibility factor has less to do with the afore mentioned overkill than the bland leads tom and amanda are so thin and ambiguously defined that there just no fun rooting for their inevitable happily ever after nor do the otherworldly powers that serve to bring them together make sense so we re left with ho hum relationship based on enchanted eclairs it not going to last long people perhaps sensing this the filmmakers have piled on weird supporting characters for acting vets like betty buckley dylan baker and patricia clarkson but they don go anywhere either in fact nothing in simply irresistible goes anywhere save for gellar and she doesn go somewhere so much as you wish she go _somewhere_ like to better movie already proving major talent with relatively few big and small screen roles she the sole reason this overcooked souffle isn completely fit for the garbage disposal looking smashing in her todd oldham designed duds and investing much more in her perfunctory part than she ever gets in return it certainly dish best not served in it current condition but one can only guess that without gellar simply irresistible would be strictly unwatchable
the 13th warrior reeks so badly of melodrama and poor acting that it carries worst scent than canine least appetizing residue the best part of the film would be close contest between the closing credits and brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely beyaz and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the projector my vote goes for the ending credits where you can start trying to put the awful experience behind you ibn fahdlan antonio banderas is an important official who is banished from his home for sleeping with another man wife he encounters group of norse warriors who convince him to join them on mysterious journey to be taken by 13 men fahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last warrior in moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that numerous persons at the screening attended broke out into laughter the movie proves to be new low point for banderas who acting seems closer to that of his role as the lover and caretaker for dying gay man in 1993 philadelphia than that of warrior in the film supposed pay off scene he exclaims was wrong these are not men line intended to be the most memorable quote of the production unfortunately banderas delivers it in fashion that makes chevy chase career look like oscar material the film based on michael crichton best selling novel eaters of the dead was shot under that name some three years ago and after numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony but the plot is incredibly difficult to follow at the same time the 13th warrior makes you think about numerous questions questions like why do the characters always have perfect lighting on them even when it is pitch dark why does no one ever have blood cover both sides of their face but rather just one side and finally will the manager give me refund 90 minutes into the 103 minute film man invites of the warriors come with me there is woman who can help unfortunately there is nothing that could help this film the most appropriate ending would have been for the 13 men to join hands form chorus line and break into rendition of springtime for hitler
ve heard it called jaws with claws and that fair summation of the plot though that tag line does little to quantify quality director stephen hopkins blown away predator and screenwriter william goldman maverick misery would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build bridge to the 20th century they ve stacked the deck with two big stars val kilmer michael douglas bigger production design beautiful photography by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond and score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music the movie doesn make lick of sense though either as an epic or as your basic boo fest in fact some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that you may think you ve stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater 3000 the movie how about the three guys with rifles who trap lion and then can even hit the damned thing or the ham on wry acting of michael douglas who chews more scenery than the animals ever do or my favorite lions so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops
billy crystal reappears in yet another high concept comedy he tries to infuse some life into it but it gets bogged down with sentimentality and lack of sophistication sammy billy crystal is struggling agent at the end of his ropes he separated from his wife serena kathleen quinlan and down to his last serious client in low budget film shooting in romania but in turn of bad luck sammy wrecks his car only to be mysteriously saved by giant gheorghe muresan but this giant has heart of altin he leads solitary life helping out the monks at local monastery his only longing is for his long lost love lilianna joanna pacula who has since moved to america sammy seeing golden ticket convinces max to become an actor represented by sammy of course and come back to america and so sam and max bounce from pathetic job to pathetic job with sammy dangling meeting with lilianna as carrot before max nose but slowly sammy deceptions begin to haunt him but will he develop conscience before the innocent max becomes disillusioned the humor in my giant isn the world greatest mostly it falls under the category of boy he so big and that can only go so far no matter how hard the talent tries still its slightly amusing parts are longed for when the movie gets bogged down in sappy moments the film best moment and that not saying much is bit part by steven seagal playing himself between executive decision and this all of seagal best roles have been cameos maybe he should consider change of work steven seagal the character actor gheorghe muresan isn natural actor at all and his thick cotton mouthed accent certainly doesn help in fact the only thing he adds to the role is his immense stature originally the concept was designed several years ago for andre the giant andre also had hefty accent but he displayed knack for comedy in the princess bride something muresan should have studied for some pointers why does billy crystal continually get caught in these pathetic comedies he proven that he can be much funnier than these formulaic films allow him to be and yet like glutton for punishment he keeps coming back that doesn mean we have to
movies can do the two big es very well educate and entertain in the best of all possible worlds they accomplish both on the kirmizi planet they fail entirely in the near future manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth this film does remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be after some mumbo jumbo about an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie does the ground crew of people you couldn care less about is trapped on the surface without food water or air and stalked by deadly rogue cyberdog the one potentially interesting character carrie anne moss spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to computer attempting to graft 2001 esque space mysticism with terminator robot horror first time director antony hoffman can seem to figure out what going on neither can we didn he have anyone who could step back from the shooting and make sure there was coherent story couldn he have used the money saved by only having to pay half dozen actors to hire scriptwriter there are so many mis steps every opportunity to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction why introduce the theme of faith vs science if the crewman who could comment on it disappears early only to die _offscreen_ the audience begins the film waiting for something to happen two hours later they re still waiting despite our greatest hopes there is no life on the kirmizi planet

alexander dumas the three musketeers is one of the most often adapted literary works and for good reason the swashbuckler is legend rather than just story perhaps the musketeer new film that reimagines the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix is one adaptation too many it just awful spiritless silly and unforgivably boring transforming the timeless classic into mish mash of old as time clich and incoherent repetitive action sequences this time artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers who can even pronounce his character name as boy he watched his father get killed by febre tim roth lackey of power hungry cardinal richelieu he vowed to have vengeance after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman he goes looking for his enemy on his quest he embroils himself in struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government the royal musketeers have lost their gusto what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal own guards only few loyal swashbuckers remain among them athos and portos who are only figureheads in this movie together with artagnan they fight to extricate the queen catherine deneuve from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant oh and as an afterthought artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn mena suvari just thought mention that now look don know whose idea this was but whoever is responsible deserves severe tongue lashing have nothing against modernizing classic works of literature at the very least they can inspire viewers to actually read the book but films as dull as this have no positive side effects director peter hyams known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas masterwork the sense of excitement cause and camaraderie instead we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing when the musketeers finally get to holler all for one and one for all could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that felt maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams tone which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the reader digest condensed version of the story that he gives us it as though anything that may have been construed as fun was purposely expunged from the production the joylessness of the proceedings from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes can be felt in every frame chambers can act suvari roth and deneuve can but aren given the chance and when push comes to shove the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious though at least roth gets to play villain without having to wear an ape suit some movies seem sloppy and careless clearly made for quick buck with the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful the film is intricate stylish and precise hitting the wrong note every single time
in this re make of the 1954 japanese monster film godzilla is transformed into jurassic park copy who swims from the south pacific to new york for no real reason and trashes the town although some of the destruction is entertaining for while it gets old fast the film often makes no sense several hundred foot tall beast hides in subway tunnels sports second rate effects the baby godzillas seem to be one computer effect multiplied on the screen lame jokes mayor ebert and his assistant gene are never funny horrendous acting even matthew broderick is dull and an unbelievable love story why would anyone want to get back together with maria pitillo character there are other elements of the film that fall flat but going on would just be waste of good words only for die hard creature feature fans this might be fun if you could check your brain at the door couldn michael redman has written this column for 23 years and has seldom had more disorienting cinematic experience than seeing both fear and loathing and godzilla in the same evening
when first saw the preview for cruel intentions turned to my friend and said dangerous liaisons for kids it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense owing everything it is to stephen frears 1988 masterpiece imagine my surprise to see that writer director roger kumble has given credit to his source material choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits and was impressed in fact was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film which is an appalling excuse for movie it kiddie porn hackwork complete with earthy sex talk and fully clothed hand jobs suppose this kind of movie was inevitable with all the teen high school angst movies coming out there was certainly room for pretentious and laughable movie about bunch of teenagers who think they re smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined cruel intentions is mess in every possible way and it fails primarily in the way expected it to hated all the characters and hate everything they do also hate ryan phillippe so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be phillippe plays check out this name sebastian valmont wow isn that memorable name could just say it over and over again sebastian valmont it kind of rolls off the tongue in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth there is no woman he can have no material object out of his reach he has all the money all the sex all at his fingertips and luckily his parents never enter into his life no in the world of cruel intentions adults don really exist the ones who do are irritating sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister kathryn merteuil sarah michelle gellar the bitch queen of the universe and also the woman every man wants since these two rich kids are so bored they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons kathryn wants sebastian valmont to de virginize cecile caldwell selma blair naive dork chick who has somehow wronged kathryn but it too easy for sebastian valmont he wants to nail annette hargrove reese witherspoon the paradigm of chastity and beauty so sebastian valmont and kathryn make deal which is too explicit to state here but dear god sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove dangerous liaisons is great movie because the characters are all believable and because of its masterful acting cruel intentions is bad for many reasons but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting kathryn merteuil is simply hateful witch girl so loathsome that would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her she is supposed to be mean but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons gellar while aesthetically pleasing is one dimensional and utterly repulsive witherspoon has truly beautiful face but her character isn the moral staple she supposed to be sure she won have sex until she in love is this really moral issue but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than little reprehensible but can forget mr phillippe who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable invulnerable blandness have to give him credit and say that he did in fact manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions and there one point in the film in which he shouts thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone true he is bad but it doesn help that he has no character to work with kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character leaving us with sex crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch the film fails in every other way too first of all nobody talks like this even the intellectuals know don bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering for while the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there no way we can join it cruel intentions also manages to come off as soft porn in more than one scene earlier mentioned fully clothed hand job this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie so if we hate them then what the point of an extended sex scene titillation of course it can even work under the pretense of meaningful love scene because we hate the characters it interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons kumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film many of the scenes have similar tone and there are moments in frears film that kumble imitates almost completely such as the last scene in which [spoiler warning the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers but kids don act like this nobody acts like this in his translation roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy some pretty crucial elements the result is picture of confounding badness kiddie porn mess that thinks it really deep and profound ll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences but that doesn change the fact that it awful
everyone knows that old rule never work with children and animals in this latest horror flick mimic case it never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals instead as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience the film begins in new york where we see children dying from mysterious disease which is being carried by cockroaches dr susan tyler sorvino creates genetically enhanced bug the judas breed however which is designed to kill all cockroaches the bug does it job the cockroaches all die and the terror is gone three years later appears on the screen and we discover that the judas breed is back bigger than ever and ready to kill the spin on this bug however is that it can mimic it predator and in this case it humans that should teach us for squishing all those bugs what should be roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be rather subdued almost boring movie which plods along at very slow pace perhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking and trying to avoid the predator type movie it could easily have become if it is then the director and writers have made the wrong move because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest the director who bought us cronos far superior film directs the film in calm and frankly dull movie there are few exciting sequences instead just lot of people talking if the dialogue was intelligent then it would be all right but it sadly babbling nonsense in fact the script is embarrsingly weak and the characterizations not much better sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come with the script not bothering to develop them there is some action in this film but it directed in such an annoying way it just infuriating to watch the camera cuts all over the place disoreitating the audience and instead of involving the audience in the action it merely alienates them the peformances are if slightly below average sorvino is although she not very good at conveying terror or anything emotion really the supporting cast are all sterotypes with characters such as big siyah security guard with foul mouth geeky scientist with spectacles and what could be the most stereotypical mexican old timer ever their reasonable good fun however mimic then may fail with it story pacing and characters but the film does look good like dark city mimic is definite case of style of content it may be bit too gloomy for it own good but the sets look nice and parts of the film are directed well but looks aren good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre somewhere where it shouldn really belong good opportunity then wasted shame overall rating= review by david wilcock 1998
this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont debut as director 1994 surprise hit speed but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead annie sandra bullock is in the wrong place at the wrong time again she going on cruise with her new boy friend alex jason patric and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger willem dafoe who has bone to pick with the shipping line they sacked him after he got sick now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship safe for compensation that actually is the whole storyline speed could do without dialogues the movie is all about images and remarkable sound don really know why this is called an action movie except for few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies first we are introduced to number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie then desaster strikes sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around looked for the action but couldn find it most of the time she is part of the decoration the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have shot at defusing bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind fire door now we know that she can handle chain saw we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds the bomb defusal of course goes wrong but only the furniture is damaged not our heroes who still are needed jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie helping other passengers and frolicking in the water his initial sea sickness is suddenly gone because there are ship crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger he does pretty good job but can blame keanu reeves for declining this part then there willem dafoe the villain who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein monster he doesn succeed though an untidy appearance isn enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential before he tries again to make us believe he is dangerous man he should practise for while in front of mirror can really recommend speed you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren meant to be funny especially the showdown when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles whole village is treat there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie in keeping with last year desaster movie tradition dog is miraculously saved from certain death really funny and meant to be funny scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie had they looked out the window they wouldn have missed the huge ship racing toward them those of you who still want to see the movie should pick theater with large screen and good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects in an adequately equipped theater it as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate but the ilm special effects can save the movie for all the money they could have done better

8mm written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become bog standard murder mystery nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles who is asked by upper class toff mrs christian myra carter to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe the movie happens to be an mythical snuff movie where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed all mrs christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not welles agrees and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies with video clerk max california phoenix as his guide although the snuff industry hasn really been examined in mainstream cinema 8mm still makes rather plodding thriller which just seems to be bit sicker than most the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away 8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much and apart from few moments most of the action in the film is nothing you haven seen from another standard thriller the cast help towards the entertainment apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona 1987 ever since leaving las vegas 1995 cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot such as in the terrible snake eyes 1998 here in 8mm he boring uninteresting and has dull monotonous voice and in this overlong thriller these virtues do not help keep the suspense up only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving as phoenix is true talent his performance is great break away from the gloom and he just purely enjoyable to watch catherine keener is completely wasted as cage wife although she delivers far better performance than her character deserves her character though is hugely underwritten one of the most wasted characters of the year also fun is fargo peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director as this film is written by the person behind seven 8mm is filled with doom and gloom and no one appears to know how to use an light switch unlike seven 8mm isn too clever and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives lacking the strong characters seven featured 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment but director joel schumacher the completely wrong guy for the job puts style over content and while the direction and look are good it just not very disturbing schumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience and though we are meant to be looking at the dark belly of the porn industry it doesn exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind which misses the point also the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed so cliched it amazing to think it the same film you re watching 8mm is far from an success snuffed opportunity with boring lead character controversial scenes that manage not to be controversial and director obsessed with looks what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is dumb thriller ultimately 8mm is probably worth renting on home video unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like and trust me the rest of the hours are not worth it
your first clue that something isn gonna be quite right with the movie you re about to see it heavily christmas themed and its release date is oh say at the end of february your second clue that something isn gonna be quite right with the movie you re about to see charlize theron one of the movie dubious stars makes an appearance on the daily show in which when asked if her new movie any good she replies with the equivalent of verbal sigh assuring us that yeah it sure is movie all right and there some scenes like those you expect to find in movie and there some action and there other stuff too how to immediately grab my attention open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits then show caption reading six days earlier ya know was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas how to immediately lose my attention follow your opening scene with terminally dull nice guys who don deserve to be in prison scene write line for the one of prisoners like just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad then have ben affleck actually say that line on film and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor for good measure throw in poorly motivated prison riot and have affleck best buddy stabbed aw and just two days before his release too already the cliches are piled on thick and when it rains it pours how to take my attention dash it violently against the rocks and make it so that contemplating my strategy for calling shotgun about an hour before know the credits will roll deny your characters the ability to think have ben affleck for some reason ll never understand pretend he his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend played by charlize theron have gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in poorly planned casino heist the villains big idea kidnap affleck because he used to be security guard at the casino force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are then dress up in santa suits create some diversions and rob the place on paper it seems like the stuff of potential caper comedy but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he looking at the makings for some sort of clever action crime thriller it not like the man isn capable far from it he the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases ve ever seen in last year ronin but he certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr moreau step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible cast ben affleck in the role of the world most generic hero he gets no good one liners he doesn get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as car thief and wants cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie his name is rudy short for rudolph in all likelihood see it called reindeer games get it get it shut up in the past affleck has been at his best as supporting actor and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as leading man step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible gary sinise villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook filmmaker could have some up with he dirty and potty mouthed he got long scruffy hair and goatee and fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them he also extremely inept at what he does he thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises and he trusts affleck character to pull through even after time and time and time again he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him but instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role sinise seems to think he playing some sort of tough smart and smooth criminal mastermind rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script [on side note gary sinise wins this week title award as he the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings last week winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards how to take your bad idea and make things worse include two or three plot twists that instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely this is bad movie and what worse is that except for few moments near the not so stunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad if they done that much at least would have been entertained

the tagline for this film is some houses are just born bad so didn expect too much from this but had preserved little spark of ope as entered the theatre thought liam neeson cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont thought mabe it will be fun and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing but by the end of it thought why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones jan de bont these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality here is the story in the monstrously over decorated mansion known as hill house visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor liam neeson into being guinea pigs in fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation among them is sophisticated bisexual cathrine zeta jones cynical dope owen wilson and gentle and emotional lady lily taylor actually the doctor is researching the primordial fear reaction and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens but he gets unexpected help from the house itself it rumbles hums and belches forth remarkable sights portals become veiny stained glass eyeballs fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like sinister mouth filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real placing an emotional wall between audience and screen the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture is that exciting or what the worst thing about it is that it didn have to be bad it based on great book ``the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience the blair witch project that cost less than an old car managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses and with $70 mill budget de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of perfectly lovely piece of terror de bont has style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is in itself frightening he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush but why give him more serious material in the end haunting will only haunt its fledgling studio dream works skg and de bont career as director yet it wouldn be fair to say that everything is bad the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated beautiful mysterious magical and spooky but this is where the good things end the music is blaring the floors moving the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming and all of this every second every moment of screen time is absolutely without life it nothing more than special effects extravaganza visually impressive but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn engage at first you do not know what going on is this part of the experiment are these hallucinations projections of the subconscience paranoia but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening the house is actually possessed it is at that point when all your hopes for good entertainment disappears out of the window for ever sat in anticipation for decent climax and that what got believe hichock once said that it better to wait for climax than to see one this may be true and it might actually work but there is only one problem jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary only stupid they are impossible to take seriously any paralells that you might have heard before linking this picture to kubrick the shining are absolutely baseless shining had class style story acting but most of all talent and originality haunting has only special effects and art direction to boast of and those elements alone are not enough to make it good film casting good actors for small pale parts only makes things worse but guess that no matter what or other critics say or write most of you will see this film anyway even if the tagline would say some films are just born stupid
the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of traveler as anywhere but here there isn one thing about this mother daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest it relies on contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives as for some reason they couldn figure it out for themselves if the film looks familiar that is because the slums of beverly hills 98 went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances in which they were fortunate to have much sharper script to work with alvin sargent script was weak and annoyingly claustral wayne wang the joy luck club inept direction made weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn convey pushy mother adele august susan sarandon forces her 14 year old daughter ann natalie portman to leave small midwestern burg to go cross country with her to beverly hills the daughter resents her twice divorced unstable but exotic schoolteacher mother bullying her to be an actress as means of escaping humdrum life the daqughter doesn even like the used altin mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio so it becomes question of who knows best as the ladies fight it out between them until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner adele dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn look that good as she lands job in slum school has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids and settles into job she hates in order to financially survive daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there during one of many arguments with her free spirited mom they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed she runs away only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop michael milhoan who offers her wise counsel with the cop zen wisdom passed onto the daughter she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla during their stay in beverly hills she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even high school rich boy admirer eliot corbin allred reader but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality as everything seemed staged and unemotional when she learns her cousin benny shawn hatosy who happens to be her best friend dies in traffic accident back in wisconsin she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasn clearly shown why she wants to stay there and for that matter it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams guess what the filmmaker is trying to say is that mom is bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one able to recognize mother faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself mother has series of setbacks like being dumped by her dream boat dentist bochner she met on the beach and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part but mother learns that her daughter has grown up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do this of course results in the corny ending showing that mom heart was always in the right place only she went about it in the wrong way this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing

walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox anastasia but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about disney recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas the hunchback of notre dame and to lesser extent hercules with anastasia fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window some may say so what it just kid movie well if you have young kids beware as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of corpse rotting rasputin zombie whose body parts continually fall off in disconcertingly real way consider yourselves warned nevertheless the animation is quite stunning at times don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout occasionally rivalling photographic quality and yet in other scenes the hand drawn material seems of the saturday morning tv crowd which leads me to wonder was this rushed to market to combat disney the plot as anyone who had read history before knows concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916 not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened as for the plot go rent disney candleshoe you ll see 60% of anastasia there
here something to chew on what the favorite food of big cheesy looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of luxury liner in deep rising the obvious answer to this question is cardboard because that the depth of the most fully developed character in this painfully generic creature feature deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by computer in fact considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas perhaps it was the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh both human and non human been scattered in all directions we learn some bloody trivia as well such as how sea monster spraypaints in kirmizi it drinks human being then spits out the liquefied remains and what it does with half digested leftovers suppose deep rising gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre but it doesn do much for me on the surface and that about the only level at which this film can be analyzed deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens titanic connection since james cameron directed both in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue in cheek mayhem of tremors deep rising somehow misses both marks by wide margin the film is not humorous tense or exciting in fact it downright boring and despite being half the length of cameron current box office champ deep rising feels like the longer movie is it really necessary to say anything about the plot probably not since it easy to guess but ll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants synopsis the film opens by introducing us to gang of bad guys on board mercenary ship in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics there finnegan treat williams the boat pilot who supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff joey kevin connor the inept sidekick who supposed to be lovable and funny but is really just irritating and hanover wes studi the mastermind and use that term lightly of the operation their goal attack cruise ship clean out the safe then sink it using some illegally acquired torpedoes the problem is by the time they reach the argonautica the titanic like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste aside from beautiful jewel thief famke janssen and couple of crew members there no one on board the reason soon becomes obvious the ship has been taken over by bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles the cast which is led by treat williams is primarily comprised of has beens and probably never will bes two exceptions wes studi best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans and djimon hounsou amistad cinque williams once can miss prospect in hollywood has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for lead role is film like deep rising and his inability to create charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career famke janssen who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye is the perfect bland match for williams given her limited acting abilities it likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes unfortunately bra defeats the purpose of having her in wet tee shirt for half of the picture meanwhile kevin connor who has entirely too much screen time exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching blackboard these days audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer generated special effects this is lesson that writer director stephen sommers who previously helmed the live action jungle book needs to learn the days of jurassic park when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen are past now movie goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic visuals that are so well incorporated that it impossible to tell where they end and where reality begins in deep rising the monster like everything is artificial and unconvincing unfortunately the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre although to be fair deep rising is particularly bad entry even once this film has sunk out of sight the knowledgeable viewer knows it won be the last of its kind like the slimy slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies more are waiting just around the corner in ambush and that consideration unlike anything on screen is truly horrifying
this is an adaptation of wells acclaimed novel the invisible man the actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue the director is paul verhoven that plus quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer should be enough to lure us into the theatre the problem is to keep us there can imagine anyone who would like to see this movie second time working on top secret military project sebastian caine kevin beacon an eccentric genius that calls himself god has discovered the secret to invisibility the first two faces are completed now it is time for the next logical step human caine volunteers for this risky experiment but when he is made invisible something goes wrong while his ex girlfriend linda elisabeth shue desperately tries to find something to return him to normal he learns that invisibility is more of prison than superpower but that not the bad thing an unexpected side effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania he is naturally given couple of modest superpowers just enough for him to survive immolation from flame thrower and an explosion of about quart of nitroglycerine soon every sense of decency is forgotten the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien rip off where caine is walking like half finished terminator spooking scaring and killing everybody though it based on novel called the invisible man the title has been ironically changed to hollow man that sums up the film very nicely this is very silly production laughable actually apparently verhoven imagination doesn stretch too far for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls locker room undetected it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie being invisible gives you the opportunity to be who you are to do what you want without being influenced by society in many ways it gives you an illusion of having life without consequences the nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about all that the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man but since this is modernization in other words dehumanization he doesn stop there he becomes rapist and then of course murderer you ll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place shue talent is barely seen josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully his face is not seen for the most part of the film and the only way he exists is as disembodied voice there are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing in the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place being probably the best technical achievement since jurassic park they are absolutely amazing we observe the layers of skin muscle tissue and bone being peeled away as body is slowly rendered invisible we see beating heart inflating lungs and veins pulsing with newly pumped blood there are couple of inventive shots with smoke fire air and water but are few scenes like that worth attending movie for what is truly disturbing is that with great book talented actors and grand budget this could have been so much more pretty much like jan de bont twister haunting paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary he was responsible for several good films basic instinct and starship troopers and some incredibly bad films showgirls total recall but he has never made anything that was great in way hollow man fits perfectly in this collection it not better or worse than verhoven average film he proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues and so instead of depth and chills verhoven inserts some of his trademarks stupid dialogue and lot of dull action with blood and naked bodies he even throws in some of the worst of film clich the slowly advancing fireball the villain who comes back from the dead etc etc and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year you ll be screaming nooooo and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion and all we can ask is why the answer is simple though hollywood is movie producing machine the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money it has to be about telling stories not marketing them it has to be about transporting us to different place to dazzle us with magic and cleverness to make us care to make us think and feel verhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is proof of that it all flesh and bones but no soul void where its imagination should be
eddie murphy has lot riding on harlem nights as the movie writer director executive producer and star murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails but at the same time he ll receive all of the credit if it succeeds should you sacrifice your hard earned cash to support murphy risky gamble well that depends on whom you trust more me or eddie murphy here what murphy thinks think the audience is expecting good time they gonna get sexy they gonna get funny they gonna get drama they gonna get all of that think it the best movie ve done paramount radio network here what think harlem nights is charmless unoriginal disappointing and almost without question the worst film of the actor career haven seen best defense and guess who to blame the movie problem is not murphy direction harlem nights is fairly good looking film no the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled murphy awful script is the culprit let count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in motion picture yes he even outdoes his own work in raw practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word and after 15 minutes it gets irritating murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast richard pryor redd foxx michael lerner and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from script riddled with stereotypes each of them shines occasionally but basically what we have are good performers stuck in bad vehicle the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life which is really neither here nor there but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 000 movie screens across the country it another matter altogether you re forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff for instance murphy punches della reese in the stomach and he shoots jasmine guy in the head this is mean spirited movie folks lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as common whore but only because she doesn have any scenes with murphy thank god he might have run her over with bulldozer murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date the loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film murphy would rather give his character spiffy wardrobe than spiffy personality sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair the plot is shameless rip off of the sting if you re going to make another sting movie you ve got to do something original murphy tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem circa 1938 fails to add anything new to the formula to get laughs murphy makes fun of stuttering you know comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped murphy idea of drama is scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life for what for shooting reese little toe off needless to say murphy shows little if any promise or imagination as screenwriter in all fairness however few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie danny aiello is fun to watch as dirty cop on the take aiello stands out in the large ensemble cast he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such nasty character racist detective with mob ties aiello zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice another bright spot is arsenio hall who has hilarious show stopping cameo as cry baby gangster hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy in fact hall ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movie unfortunately his character is completely irrelevant to the plot murphy should have given hall much bigger role of course ve already mentioned that didn care for murphy character but have to admit that did love his neckties they are simply spectacular almost worth the price of admission
because no one demanded it david duchovny in romantic comedy at last both his romantic magnetism and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot which could be fodder for valentine day episode of the files bob rueland david duchovny loses his wife elizabeth joely richardson in car accident at the same time grace briggs minnie driver is in the hospital waiting for heart transplant grace gets elizabeth heart and it leads her to bob it the romantic equivalent of all those horror films where someone gets transplant from serial killer and then is driven to slaughter people four writers are credited with contributing to the story that doesn seem possible despite being solid two hours long return to me adds little to the boy meets girl boy loses girl formula and as result is terribly tedious and slow moving duchovny and driver seem unable to generate any sparks and kept wishing for fast forward button to move their scenes along since driver has managed to work well in romantic roles before blame duchovny he out of his element without the manufactured and static sexual tension of his tv series and ve always thought that the relationship between mulder and scully on the files comes off more sibling like than hot and bothered there something about duchovny that makes me uneasy regardless of the role he playing he comes off as weirdo the only redeeming quality of return to me is its hilarious supporting cast the circle of friends and relatives around bob and grace is constantly playing matchmaker and they generate the only laughs in the movie carroll connor is grace grandfather marty reilly when bob comes into marty restaurant after hours marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status when marty discovers that bob is widower he invites bob to join his poker game and introduces him with the declaration this is bob his wife is dead the poker buddies are just as desperate to find mate for grace and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news also funny bonnie hunt as grace best friend megan and james belushi as megan husband joe married with children megan and joe provide useful counterpoint by showing the mundane results of romance although it rare to see him in movie that premieres in theater belushi delivers his lines with great comic skill rounding out the impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bob best friend and robert loggia as marty brother in law angelo in only the lead actors lived up to the standards set by the rest of the cast bottom line if you are compelled to see this movie watch it on video so you can fast forward to scenes with carroll connor and james belushi
not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream but guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write second draft seriously this idea psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends is great one and wish it could have been pulled off the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue an example that [car crash] must ve been awful for everyone involved you can tell that the writer intended that something little more airy was supposed to have been said just no one figured out what know in slasher movies there isn supposed to be lot of great characterization and myself don mind cardboard cutouts but please don let the cutouts be so damn bland one reason movies like scream star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters aside from jared leto and joshua jackson who aren on the screen long enough no one in urban legend makes the grade alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive not to mention as dumb as post through of the film and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot good thing brad dourif is here but wait he only in the movie for five minutes _and_ he just redoing his good natured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoo nest which brings me to another aspect of urban legend it unoriginality the film most blatantly ripped off is scream another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after craven and williamson great success urban legend tries to deconstruct modern day folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films but it doesn quite succeed it best stab at self reflexivity is poking fun at that girl in the noxzeema ad ie rebecca gayheart we also have another killer taunting his victim on the phone routine in urban legend and quick what movie is this exchange of dialogue from female protagonist why villain why why congratulations to those of you who answered scream and or urban legend like said this movie could ve been great if only silvio had worked or been allowed to work little longer on the script still at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than know what you did last summer
drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl outside the one who the awkward klutz or the spunky do it yourselfer the one who just doesn fit in with the others she has perfected these characters in movies such as the wedding singer and most notably ever after now she back starring in what could be called modern day cinderella fable never been kissed you know it fable because she plays copy editor at newspaper who has her own office as well as secretary trust me on this one no copy editor has seen the inside of private office since gutenberg and don mean steve invented the printing press the premise is simple barrymore josie geller at 25 the youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago sun times is assigned to go undercover and return to high school to do an expose on what today teens are feeling and doing josie she says she was named after the 70s cartoon character was geek in high school so she jumps at the opportunity for second chance this time she thinks she will get it right and be accepted by the in crowd now what kind of adult with good job and successful career would actually look forward to reliving the hell that was and is high school and adolescence these are among the many problems that plague never been kissed screenwriters abby kohn and marc silverstein cannot get handle of josie their script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy blubbering woman child at the least provocation and the fact that an adult would put so much stock into trying to become tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly south glen high school most popular girls leads you to question her maturity and mental stability ok so never been kissed is not sociological expose of today high school scene however certain rules should apply to film and one of those is consistency of character among the movie problems is the ill conceived conceit that josie would seriously strive to climb the high school food chain and in the process lose focus on her assignment any competent editor would have tossed her ass out the door quicker than you could say get me rewrite to be fair barrymore is very appealing but she is given very little to work with she tries valiantly to get firm grip on her character but the script continually undermines her barrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of the script in which she tries to walk talk and act like cool hip high schooler otherwise she is left foundering on cliched sea of teen age stereotypes and situations never been kissed is entertaining and funny in fits and starts it lacks consistency and firm grasp on what it wants to accomplish the movie main bright spot is provided by leelee sobieski as aldys the outsider who befriends new student josie josie sees lot of her former self in aldys yet still abandons her to hang out with the popular girls real mature and that is the main deficiency with never been kissed it illogical unrealistic uneven and undemanding it has some warm and humorous spots but not enough to overcome its many obstacles
come on silent bob we re going to hollywood starring jason mewes kevin smith will ferrell shannon elizabeth seann william scott chris rock jason lee ben affleck directed by kevin smith rated jay and silent bob strike back is dumb movie disguised in smarmy interior kevin smith coming off the wonderful challenging dogma fills it with sub road trip gross out jokes and expects us to buy it because he just oh so ironic but when movie is so self aware it becomes about nothing but itself we can hardly be expected to pay for admission jay and silent bob two new jersey stoners who hang out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot have appeared in almost all of smith movies but if not mistaken have not starred in one until now they find out that there is movie based on the comic book that is based on them being made in hollywood this presents two problems they haven received penny in royalties and nerds on the internet what the internet are talking trash about them what is there to do except go to hollywood and stop this movie from being made on the way they re hitchhiking because who knew you needed tickets to take bus they run into group of hotties who pretend to be with an animal rights group but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlie angels style outfits of course they set jay and silent bob up to look like the thieves so that there is massive manhunt going on during the second half of the film will ferrell who again proves himself incapable of doing anything but sketch comedy shows up as the wildlife marshal inspector who thinks the two have stolen monkey the movie will probably please only smith die hard undiscerning fans everyone else will be critical of this mind bogglingly stupid effort following some the sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years past any appeal the movie has will come from the in jokes most of which think understood but the movie is in to the point of absurdity there needs to be something holding it together other than its own smugness once jay and silent bob get to hollywood the movie abruptly switches gears from gross out comedy to ridiculously broad hollywood satire countless hot movie stars and personalities make an appearance from smith veterans matt damon and ben affleck to wes craven but jay and silent bob strike back resorts to such low brow gags as another scream sequel with monkey as the killer get it they re so desperate for another movie they ran out of ideas and used monkey monkey as often happens with writers who are working below what they are actually capable of most of the really good lines are throwaways while the big painstaking gags mostly fall flat one of the funniest lines in the movie flies by when asked to comment on the clitoris don ask jay responds the female clitoris kevin smith is talented writer though agree that his films would be better off if he let real director take the helm and jay and silent bob strike back holds true to his promise to make more facetious film unfortunately it also shapeless pointless and largely unfunny smith verbal trampoline as ben affleck once called his distinctive dialogue takes back seat to his dubious instincts as populist filmmaker this was supposed to be the movie that didn offend anyone but it offensive because it terrible
let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official and even unofficial james bond series it is so full of self parody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching spoof an omen of what is to come is provided by the pre credits sequence dull affair featuring confrontation between man it difficult to give better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie and the assassin of the title song with woefully terrible lyrics follows and the rest of the movie is even worse the plot might have been pleasant change from the usual rule the world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s but here we get confused mismash about fabled assassin francisco scaramanga christopher lee putting in performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moore 007 there is also flimsy connection with the energy crisis and missing solar cell with 95% efficiency it as much of mess as it sounds bond is helped in his task by mary goodnight ekland whose character couldn possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo during the course of the movie she gets locked in both closet and car trunk blunders around control room accidentally setting off laser and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever maud adams later to star in octopussy is much more stronger and useful character but she hardly features in the movie scaramanga lackey is dwarf called nik nak who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures worse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie there is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in not counting ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists another misguided attempt at humour the solitary car chase might have been highlight but the action is interrupted on frequent basis by redneck sheriff pepper played by clifton james of live and let die fame yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window he is easily the most irritating character in james bond movie even his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history 360 degree twisting loop jump over broken bridge could have been except somebody got the idea to dub mocking whistle tone over the final print on top of that debacle the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga funhouse the only good thing that came out of this movie was that the producers had to make the next film in the series the infinitely superior the spy who loved me great film in order for the bond franchise to survive
since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993 steven spielberg drama schindler list and directed 1993 intelligent searching for bobby fischer his new film civil action should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career what doesn make sense is how such high profile and superb actors as john travolta robert duvall william macy and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project which is both dull and completely ineffective the film which involves small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally charged but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings leaving us with nothing more than poorly done courtroom drama based on book by jonathan hart which was consequently based on true account civil action is set in 1982 in the town of woburn mass where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann john travolta decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children death from leukemia due to unknown causes jan originally decides to drop the case but when he stumbles across to corporate giants grace and beatrice foods who have plants located near the families homes he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which thus goes into the city drinking water suddenly after hearing about the families heartbreak and personal stories he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery even though he is warned by his staff accountant william macy that no money is coming in to them only going out also figuring into the story is jerome facher robert duvall beatrice foods corporate counsel who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20 million offer to settle the case coming from such talented writer director and cast not to mention one of the most interesting film composers danny elfman civil action is an astoundingly empty headed drama one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be relatively uncommercial motion picture zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning watching the film couldn help but notice its similarities with 1997 far far superior film the sweet hereafter which dealt with lawyer played brilliantly by ian holm investigating school bus accident that killed number of children in his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident holm interviews the grieving parents as well as the sole surviving passenger teenage girl which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter young drug addict who has run away from home not only was the plotting similar to civil action but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes considering this it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful sweet hereafter was not only concentrating on the school bus accident but delving deeply into ian holm character and his own personal demons as well as the teenage girl in civil action however have no idea where the running time went since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness we do not get to know the parents very well nor any of the main characters through its whole duration did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta lawyer character jan schlictmann who doesn appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job every scene is tediously related directly to the premise and therefore there was no one for me to care about or root for you ve got to work pretty hard actually to not get an audience to become involved in the parents plight since their children are dead but that is exactly what civil action does to be honest would be fairly hard pressed to state an aspect of the film that actually liked aside from one flashback to when man young son died on the way to the doctor remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes and more than once found my mind wandering could say the performances were good but who fooling who since every character is one dimensionally written no one acting abilities are challenged in any way travolta plays lawyer well enough but that about all he does duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role apparently only appearing to give one liners at every chance he gets and what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture final scene as judge she appears unbilled since it is just cameo but why did she even agree to do it in the first place finally when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role the film left me with another question what was the point abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum where none came before that to begin with civil action seemed to me at least to be an example of how not to make courtroom drama and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with
synopsis al simmons top notch assasin with guilty conscience dies in fiery explosion and goes to hell making pact with malebolgia chief demon there simmons returns to earth years later reborn as spawn general in hell army donning necroplasmic costume replete with knives chains and morphing cape sullen wise cogliostro and flatulating wisecracking violator vy for spawn attention comments when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics where he had made name for himself as first rate comic book penciller on the spider man titles to join the newly formed creator owned image comics new comic book legend was born spawn mcfarlane spawn immediately became commercial and critical success and defining comic book series of the 1990s mcfarlane created hero who was not only original but visually intricate allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max the early spawn issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing with the popularity of spawn and the success of the current warner bros batman film franchise movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn in the summer of 1997 hence new line cinema released spawn live action film based on the groundbreaking series this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book like me numbed by how much spawn misses the mark what happened why is spawn so bad todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in cameo don think however that his presence necessarily hurt or helped the film place the blame in part on the recent hollywood trend fueled by public demand apparently for special effects blow out movies utilizing the latest computer technology these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else character plot dialogue etc spawn reflecting this trend shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics hardly minute goes by in this film without fires explosions knives and chains appearing out of nowhere glowing eyes or constantly transforming demons lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid don get me wrong but because the script and cast aren engaging spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper the surface may capture the eye but nothing exists underneath spawn translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level mcfarlane spawn was tortured hero mercenary by trade al simmons was nonetheless warm man in love with the beautiful wanda having died and journeyed to hell he made pact to return to earth to be with wanda simmons however discovers that his memories are fragmented his body creepy mess and his wife married despite his sometimes violent nature readers couldn help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so when the characters are developed they seem absurd rather than touching the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot general possesses the antidote to supervirus called heat 16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world do not help matters spawn in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman also unwisely spends too much time on villain the violator batman favored the joker over batman john leguizamo like jack nicholson in batman receives top billing in the cast as the violator michael jai beyaz al simmons spawn is second ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him perfect candidate for the violator the film however spends so much time on the violator offensive antics that they grate on the nerves apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film as nicholson was in batman especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn the violator lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny leaving the audience wishing he would leave leguizamo does satisfactory job in the role but he is seen far too often in the film michael jai beyaz relative newcomer to theatrical releases seems to be an appealing actor and he handles his role adequately but we see little of him without various masks on more time needed to be spent on white character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings special note should be made about martin sheen as the over the top obnoxious evil general wynn easily the hammiest performance in the movie it hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much after all he played vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now sheen excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as mastermind villain and comes as surprise considering his extensive career in film many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down mtv style jerky in your face editing is one of them flames for example roll across the screen sometimes to announce shift in setting cogliostro unlikely wannabe guide for spawn serves as poor narrator for the film he goofily tells the audience at one point that how much of [spawn s] humanity is left remains to be seen as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another the music finally assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes to be fair however marilyn manson long hard road out of hell effectively compliments spawn return to earth while filter and the crystal method can you trip like do proves surprisingly fitting theme song for as good comic book as it is spawn did not spawn good movie spawn instead suffers from too much pomp and circumstance and too little plot and character development it receives two stars for its technically well done special effects many other films though have equal if not superior special effects and are much better rated pg 13 spawn seems more violent than many rated movies and probably wouldn be appropriate for the very young
can recall previous film experience where the fairly good time was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota for forty minutes or so was lured into loopy if occasionally over wrought romantic comedy and was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt then rather suddenly was clubbed over the head with nasty bit of violence shortly thereafter was whacked in the gut by another feeling minnesota is film that made me feel violated as though had trusted writer director steven baigelman to bring me cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face feeling minnesota tells the story of topless dancer named freddie cameron diaz who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss kirmizi delroy lindo suspects her of stealing from him red punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper sam clayton vincent onofrio who is far from the man of freddie dreams enter jjaks keanu reeves sam estranged younger brother who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie eye and have sex with her in the bathroom united in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam jjaks and freddie take off together but sam isn ready to let them go without fight freddie meanwhile isn ready to let sam money go without fight and thus begins series of violent confrontations there is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam intense sibling rivalry as boys and their mother tuesday weld sending jjaks away to live with his father it does great job of setting up jjaks unstable life life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family reeves wounded look is just right for jjaks the wedding sequence includes number of nice moments most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which simple question is given very funny spin most important baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy as in scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements will dare on the car radio you would have every reason to expect that relationships both familial and romantic would be the focal point of feeling minnesota unfortunately you would be dead wrong suppose should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which kirmizi threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding but certainly didn expect what got what got was yet another in long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality or rather creating gags about brutality suddenly the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes story about corpse and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another but there is no consistency to the characterizations vincent onofrio turns in manic performance as sam whose jealousy competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks while reeves turns into framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood there are films which have managed to employ radical shift in tone successfully jonathan demme something wild and neil jordan the crying game come to mind but they didn try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment don want to dismiss baigelman successes out of hand he gets fun performance out of dan aykroyd as crooked cop and some well crafted comic moments and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as light hearted caper it _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value and that he can make his two halves into whole feeling minnesota left me feeling used and there not much funny about that
wolfgang petersen latest the perfect storm is like pineapple it only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging if you try to eat the fruit spikes and all it going to hurt quite bit ok maybe that was confusing analogy so here my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick there isn really much of story to tell basically massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on small boat called the andrea gail and gets stuck in the middle of the storm of the century how much time does it take for petersen to tell this story not nearly enough so he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous audiences want to see the storm they want to see fight for survival but what they get is lot of cliched maudlin drivel the last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect but just try lasting the first three quarters have yet to read sebastian junger the perfect storm but from what have heard it is an unforgettable tale based on true story the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version the approach is weak using wonderfully patriotic score by james horner petersen almost hides the in your face banality right away the central characters are introduced the gritty determined captain george clooney the ingenue mark wahlberg torn between his job and his girlfriend diane lane the loving father john reilly the comic relief who always trying to get laid john hawkes the new guy william fichtner who immediately antagonizes crewmate and the quiet french guy allen payne so many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer it is not the all star cast fault just the characters designed for their portrayal allen payne character never speaks in the entire movie not because he is mute but because he never given any lines are we supposed to root for guy whose face and voice we are never given chance to interact with fichtner character is terribly underdeveloped we don know what he doing there where he from or who he supposed to be the remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes hawkes says to female stranger in one scene you know what would look good on you me ooooh real creative as the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters the crew continues to not feel human only when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk the computer generated images of gigantic waves crashing against helpless boat are thunderously real can only imagine if this was an imax film this city kid would surely never go in the water again this is loud jolting entertainment adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film the perfect storm was unfortunately disappointment the maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so guess ll stick to that other survival spectacle you know the one on cbs
highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature beams itself onto russian science vessel well this is the point where the movie strays from becoming decent and original movie and simply becomes predictable sci fi thriller anyhow this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the virus known as man the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated and then hapless crew on tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies the movie is that predictable the story is full of very shallow characters that don do much other than subsist the captain of the tug played by donald sutherland makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age looks to be in his 60 to add to this we re shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific in typhoon no less none of the characters seem to work together at all they are always bickering and vying for some form of control this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in tub and someone is simply creating waves it looks genuinely fake granted trying to recreate typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish also on the topic of flaws the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly why if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics should it not be able to create them move faster regardless the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it as to the actual casting for the movie finally there is nothing to complain about the actors were superb but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe watching these actors act this story out made it bearable if barely the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch mediocre sci fi thriller then you won be too disappointed as the movie is but the latest in genre that was originally created by aliens it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv
this movie is based off the wildly popular video game series of the same name before this film the game had few spin off cartoons which were ok but the idea of doing movie is insane it should have been animated if it should have been done at all instead the people do the best they can with talented cast yet it still fails the plot is completely different from the game plot not complaining about that the story involves the mario bros having plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with rival company eventually they find construction site by their nemesis which happens to be enviromentally un safe so due to luigi john leguizamo girlfriend princess daisy they go and investigate they get transported to blade runner esque world lead by king koopa dennis hopper somehow plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic mega city jumbles in the plot is fine better than the movie deserves the acting is ok this seems to be more of visual film the special effects are good especially on the robotic yoshi however the film drags and is no fun and it leaves itself open to sequel which probably won ever be made this movie begins sort of promising but ends up leaving weird taste in your mouth so if you want to watch sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper then watch super mario bros the movie you could do worse but you could definitely do better street fighter the movie 1995 starring raul julia and jean claude van damme this movie was based off of series of never ending sequels to game called street fighter it has all the characters from the game in reasonable plot it is more like movie than it should be yes it watchable raul julia does good job considering this was his final film while the game had non stop fighting sequences this movie is hodge podge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off plot at the same time does it work sort of the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by bison raul julia guile jean claude van damme takes his troops to attack bison main base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over in short amount of time the movie introduces several characters well it catches your attention but it ultimately seems like showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like there chun li or look at that fire ball ryu did at vega it hits the bases by presenting the characters in plot with good sets but goes no further this movie needed more action in the first place the action scenes that are here are short and not very exciting if you like light hearted action flicks or if you liked the game watch this one it is even worth watching if you want to see raul julia last performance or if you can get enough of van damme other than that you could find better action flicks
studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring cliched individual not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio which they did according to this film are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly that character who is bland ripoff of tony manero would really make good protagonist for the film about it 54 belongs in the elite group of films known as the big disappointments the films that attain so much hype and or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished was heavily awaiting 54 not the least because ve become fascinated with the infamous club which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that been running all summer on vh1 which is weirdly enough much more intriguing and engrossing than this edgy film perhaps more importantly 54 is part of the blossoming subgenre the 70s nostalgia film which has been picking up mighty steam what with boogie nights and the last days of disco coming out within the year and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of certain time period the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period but brought us interesting and real characters like scotty the tragically gay boom mike operator from boogie nights and charlotte the ironically clueless and bitchy co protagonist from the last days of disco not to mention several others 54 deals not so much with the timeline of the studio how it began how it was run how it ended that all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale but more interested in the characters who populated it this is definite plus here film that could have been fascinating hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases economy problems and perhaps worst of all reagan all hit and forced everyone into rude awakening the story of the studio is tragedy in itself let look at how it all affected the people but this film doesn let that happen it gives us half assed protagonist named shane shea ryan phillippe from know what you did last summer who chief character trait is the fact that he from new jersey which also happens to be his chief character flaw guess he dim witted into being part of the scene and soon finds he become bit of rave amongst the studio regulars bit like saturday night fever cept no travolta and no real interest put into him poor poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting but all he is half assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been shane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club like anita salma hayek wannabe donna sommers and her young hubby greg randanzo breckin meyer from clueless who helps shane become bartender and rise to bit of fame although he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster sela ward an exec of sorts he falls in lust with soap star named julie siyah neve campbell and thus the boring romance subplot that all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film the film sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all too necesary personage of steve rubell played by mike myers you heard me rubell the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation but the film thanks to surprisingly strong performance by myers makes him out to be more than that notice the scenes sole shocking scene where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for promotion myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene and couple others that some of us who ve only seen him on tv never saw and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails first time feature director mark christopher proves that he better director than writer though not too terribly much his story is trite and shallow as are his characters and his direction is shockingly flat especially for film about this subject it as if he had great story to tell but instead opted for the easier route the studio recreation is amazingly accurate though and very impressive but his direction is never captivating enough some people say that film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in despite the film tone still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after saw fellini la dolce vita and when watched 54 didn particularly want to stay
in the past tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman and the hilarious ed wood but lately his films just don cut it sleepy hollow has some unique features but the script is terrible mess for those who remember disney fantastic adventures of ichabod crane it is actually superior to this disney version was at least interesting while burton film drags on far too long without any suspense or frights while the stories are similar the new version adds too much to the once likable story and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off ichabod crane johnny depp is now apparently constable who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders the victims are headless and no traces of evidence were found until the murderer reveals himself hence the headless horseman now with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy they must stop the headless horseman from killing spree that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster in the original the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable no one could stop him not even ichabod by the end of the film it had audiences in deep thought burton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere and how to make the main characters heroes he takes no risk what so ever and this is where he fails another pathetic element of the film was the script like said earlier he just stuffed too much in at one time and made it look real sloppy kind of like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims he completely butchered the story to pieces thankfully there are few factors that particularly liked the acting by depp was quite notable he took the nerdy character of the cartoon and simply acted it out in better manner if it wasn for his quirky one liners doubt could have remained awake because quite frankly was getting sleepy just when thought christina ricci was getting to be good actress she winds up doing this it just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up big blockbuster it too tempting to let go even if the script is mush the atmosphere too was quite involving should have just gazed at the sets and the eerie fog rather than actually pay attention to what was going on at least burton films are eye candy even if they are trash the only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads and the fight between the horseman depp and casper van dien other than that wish could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film and just sit back and stare at the scenery by the end can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed this is the biggest disappointment of the year especially when such talented director like burton handles project like this don waste your time or money because your head will feel hollow
plot rich psychiatrist with great home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped by some bad guys who want him to extract some information from the mind of one of his nutty patients of course the patient is not cooperative and the doctor only has few hours to comply with their demands before they kill his daughter pretty good premise no critique if you re not fan of movies packed with plot holes inconsistencies and yes even more plot holes heed my words and skip this hollow thriller and don like saying that either since this film actually had some potential and started off pretty well sure the story is basically just an amalgamation of ransom primal fear and nick of time pureed into one but the whole psychiatrist working against the clock thing actually had me engaged at first but it at about the halfway mark of this movie that the bottom drops out and all that we re left with are lot of questions and very few plausible answers we get the overly smart kid who manages to pull one over on the bad guys we get weak woman with her leg in cast beating the crap out of tough bad guy we get douglas character new york uppedity psychiatrist suddenly turning into an action hero with moves and attitude to boot and what about the film main plot point why would the bad guys still give crap about this thing after 10 years and even more so why would they only give the shrink until the day end to do his part you waited 10 years what another few days or why not set up another heist instead ll tell you why it because we wouldn have bad movie otherwise that why and many many more ugh whatever the case it was just about the time that douglas character suddenly removed murphy character from the mental home and how come she went with him so nicely thought she didn trust him that turned to my buddy and asked when the movie had turned into joke and few bogus chase and action sequences later we were left with long winded ending that did little to answer any other questions might ve still had and actually brought up even more contradictions badly put together this movie features some decent acting some nice cinematography and an initially interesting premise but loses it all in haze of plot miscues which ultimately leave you with little care for anyone in fact if it wasn for brittany murphy excellent portrayal of traumatized teen jennifer esposito embarrassing performance as police woman yeah right watching her delivering lines was the funniest part of this flick but it wasn supposed to be and michael douglas cool regular guy part there would be little reason to remain seated until the end of this picture incidentally can anyone please give me one good reason why esposito character was in this movie in the first place she was completely superfluous and on top of all that by the end of this flick the director seems to have realized how dumb the audience must be to have bought most of the garbage that he been shoveling out for the hour and half prior and decides to add insult to injury by flashing back to an earlier character death when one of the bad guys dies just so we know as an audience that the two are interrelated somehow ooooh thanks mr fleder appreciate the spoon feeding dude yum yum but how about explaining every other plot point in your film that made no sense whatever either way don give rat ass because this movie is dog and that unfortunate because it actually did have some good points going for it see it if you like dumb thrillers incidentally if you appreciated along came spider you will likely enjoy this film as well they both start off with interesting premises only to toss all logic and sense out the window about halfway through where joblo coming from along came spider 10 girl interrupted 10 kiss the girls 10 primal fear 10 seven 10 10
wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world and wish that film makers would use commandments as blueprint on how _not_ to do it writer director daniel taplitz has created bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul searching in this tale of seth warner aidan quinn man of faith who runs into streak of bad luck which usually inspires country western lyrics his pregnant wife drowns his home is destroyed by tornado he loses his job and his dog is crippled by bolt of lightning convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant seth decides to break his and sets out to turn every thou shalt not of the ten commandments into thou shalt and vice versa his wife sister rachel friends courteney cox wants to help seth rachel selfish husband harry anthony lapaglia who tends to break few commandments of his own thinks seth is lunatic thus begins film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion taplitz isn interested in treating seth tragedies as genuinely tragic making it impossible to sympathize with him composer joseph vitarelli provides score full of whimsical woodwinds turning seth sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark quinn performance as seth is all wild eyed fervor without any genuine pain the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought with one through five dispatched in five minute montage the result is character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of high concept movie plot it not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth corporate attorney rachel is given case which is supposed to soften hard heart we see no indication she has while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seth false witness only courteney cox strikes note of reality in solid performance she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve even she can force taplitz to decide whose story this is or what we should have learned about dealing with the struggles in our lives and our relationship with the infinite by the time seth makes singularly biblical reappearance late in the film it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience commandments is bad comedy which could have been decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith and the loss thereof at all seriously
the high school comedy seems to be hot genre of the moment with she all that and varsity blues behind us and several more set for release later in the year the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance however you wouldn know it from the quality of the latest entry jawbreaker this shockingly bitter candy definitely has sour center the most popular and most feared clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma they have accidentally killed one of their own the teen dream liz purr charlotte roldan choked on giant jawbreaker during kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday now the three surviving girls must decide what to do it takes little time at all for the group leader courtney rose mcgowan to decide to cover it up the ditzy marcie julie benz is game to go along but the clique final member julie rebecca gayheart has guilty conscience to make things worse another student the hopelessly geeky fern mayo judy evans greer accidentally discovers the truth the girls cover is surely blown not so fast thinking quickly courtney offers fern once in lifetime chance after quick makeover fern is transformed into vylette the beautiful new girl at school and full fledged member of the popular crowd does this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder or will this finely honed plan crack over time jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation and failing miserably might add it manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations but misses three crucial elements sharp dialogue witty characters and the much needed humor it is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being darkly humorous if it wasn shackled to its dead weight plot the film most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo at this point jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths but then all of sudden the innovation stops the film becomes mired in the murder and cover up plotting which quickly saps what little life and energy there was right out of the film in the film rose mcgowan fares the best as the manipulative clique leader she truly dominates every scene she in not difficult feat in crowd such as this however it character crying out for better movie or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact jawbreaker doesn quite know how to handle its semi likable characters fern and julie either one could effectively end the movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows the lengths to which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters as their motives become murky and unclear the film finally falls to the point that it doesn really matter who wins or loses since all sides have become equally detestable detestable is good word to describe the film jawbreaker it certain that like the murder weapon described in the film title jawbreaker will be triggering more than one gag reflex in the audience
capsule wild jungle woman and an 11 story gorilla are discovered in tibet and taken to hong kong where the gorilla escapes and causes havoc this is laughable 1977 rip off of king kong 1976 itself rip off production values are low and audiences seem to like the film mostly for derisive laughter high to +4 directed by ho meng hua this film is provided to be sort of laughing stock to finish the festival an earthquake uncovers an 11 story tall gorilla in the himalayas hunter chosen because he just broke up with his girl and is at loose ends gets sent to find the ape and finds sort of female tarzan who controls the ape evelyne kraft is the jungle girl in leather bikini that she is pasted into so she always looks on the verge of bouncing out of gorilla actor has no idea how gorillas move and suit is terrible nice miniature effects however has almost music video inside it of jungle girl playing with animals like chi chi the leopard several places there is narrative that is nearly incoherent as if there are missing scenes and the viewer has to guess what happened in the interim actual location shooting in mysore ape shown badly matted behind temple combining of images usually pretty bad incompetent matching of film stocks stock footage frequently used gorilla brought to hong kong by greedy entrepreneur who really abuses the ape before it escapes and tears things up real good
`the bachelor is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see wading through this gooey detestable sludge is quite the chore for even dedicated romantic those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere `the bachelor is painfully clumsy mess strung together with few brief moments of surprising poignancy awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty boy cocoon chris donnell has an effortless charm as an actor most will recognize him as the high flying robin from the two latest `batman films but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile can donnell carry the weight of film on his shoulders perhaps if he found the proper vehicle but `the bachelor falls far short of the requirements the actor just can register with such pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success few instances of adorable humor aside it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is `the bachelor donnell plays jimmie hopeless romantic in his late twenties who progressing in serious relationship with anne renee zellweger jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage the problem is that his proposal sucks big time you can tell things aren going pleasantly because jimmie gets the infamous deer in the headlights look when anne questions his approach and then the plot along with the stupidity of the movie thickens jimmie grandfather peter ustinov dies suddenly leaving video will behind for his grandson who also happens to be his only living relative everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie of course there catch he must get married before his 30th birthday stay joined with his bride for an entire decade and produce healthy children within the first five years the bad news is that jimmie birthday is the following day with anne out of town he must find willing bride to share his riches with and within very limited time frame there are certainly few worthwhile aspects of `the bachelor for one the movie approach is interesting and not dripping with clich another is the colorful cast donnell and zellweger are cute together and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in it own mediocrity ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure and james cromwell is sincere and effective as wise priest dragged through jimmie marital adventures and now the cons the approach may be interesting but in trying an old fashioned method director gary sinyor gives the film synthetic feel the characters are drawn with obvious broad strokes and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable yes `the bachelor is far more frustrating than cute the screenplay is lamely written and the subject matter poorly conceived the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted along with whatever promise the film initially contained potential goes out the window early to suit sinyor `colorful approach but not minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director wishes `the bachelor becomes lost without homing beacon to save it you ve seen the tv spots haven you donnell is madly rushing down deserted street and the caption reads `what is this man running from in actuality he fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune it one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film after seeing the movie believe that the approaching horde could be something else donnell could be running from his angry fans who have just endured `the bachelor and are hunting him down for revenge
topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that mentioned in the devil advocate movies that have brilliant beginning but don know how to end it begins by introducing us to selection of characters who all know each other there is liz who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment prue who is getting married geoff liz boyfriend neil her previous boyfriend ant who has written screenplay for the first hour we get to know these people through everyday activities as they talk on the phone go out to dinner hang clothes on the line the interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them at times the events border on the ridiculous like the screening of the film but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives this doesn sound like brilliant premise for film we just follow lot of people around who are vaguely related but it the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing unfortunately this level of honesty isn maintained with about half an hour to go sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama such disappointment after such brilliant start the actors are all quite good with ms danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive the energy of her character is palpable and is major reason the movie is so watchable lot of the performances are bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film it seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles that is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such shock up till that point was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place while the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility it unlikely in way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film not just the events but also the tone of some of the end is wrong clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it this is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not good film as stated above the first hour is superb and even the end is above average it just takes turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss
beware of movies with the director name in the title take john carpenter ghosts of mars please if the carpenter brand name wasn superglued to the title this embarrassment would surely have bypassed theaters entirely and gone straight to its proper home on the usa network and would have been spared headache the latest from the director of starman halloween and escape from new york is lousy western all gussied up to look like futuristic horror flick the production is set on mars in 2176 where humanity looks for relief from the overpopulation strangling their home world six hundred and forty thousand people in matriarchal society live and work at outposts all over the kirmizi planet terra forming to make it more hospitable for future generations matriarchal society terra forming sounds pretty intriguing eh well don get your hopes up

the event horizon is the boundary of siyah hole and in the future it also the name of spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than the speed of light by traversing through its own portable siyah hole naturally this is the setup for the other event horizon the movie when the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at just outside of neptune the crew of the ship called the lewis and clark has to go to investigate and dr william weir the creator of the event horizon gets to come along for the ride if you ve glanced at poster for this movie you know that supposedly what follows is infinite terror well don know about the terror part but infinite certainly seems to qualify event horizon is mean spirited gory sick excuse for film it starts off as an alien rip off and then degenerates into pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes at least for those first 40 minutes it an interesting rip off of alien that lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie which seems to go on forever it not scary monster movie nor is it psychological thriller it is simply movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore you ve seen this kind of movie before the hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility this is kind of movie for which have no respect kind of movie which had hoped died out years ago it is quite possible for movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore but event horizon takes the low road and the viewers pay the price there are many good respectable performances from fishburne and neill most noticably paul anderson direction is impressive as it was in mortal kombat there are many nice special effects mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero gravity the sets are beautiful to gaze upon and richard jones character cooper is hilarious and extremely likable more so than most characters ve seen in recent movies for the little screen time that he has and none of this can save the movie from being grade level of film the idea of ship that has some sort of life within its walls life that knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers is promising one haunted house story in space isn such bad idea but the final execution is extremely disappointing that not to say that philip eisner here making his feature film writing debut doesn have talent for those first 40 minutes he manages to make tired premise interesting adding in aspects of unique flavor into rip off story and that something that not too many writers can do he even has one scene that though it also tries to sicken the audience has honestly tense feel to it the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space he definitely has something of gift but it not fully on display here certainly will look forward to seeing more from him and hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise but because of what this movie degenerates into have little or no respect and got little or no enjoyment out of it if this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film then agree with laurence fishburne sentiment god help us
there is rule when it comes to movies sequel is never as good as the original there are very few exceptions to this rule and texas chainsaw massacre the next generation is not one of them now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was really bad movie and that this isn even the first sequel to it you have recipe for very painful viewing experience don be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey time to kill and renee zellweger jerry maguire they made this movie before they were stars judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons it wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger apparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day and don blame them they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them unfortunately for them it is horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character while mcconaughey plays guy who wears mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with television remote control hey don say didn warn you to make matters worse leatherface the chainsaw wielding maniac who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers at the best of times has now become full blown cross dresser and spends the entire movie in drag there is plot to this movie but it isn worth mentioning let just suffice to say that group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left to the mercy of remote control man mcconaughey and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving half witted sidekick man can get over just how bad this movie is this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities even the obligatory topless babe shot wasn enough to hold my interest for more than seconds the writing is bad the direction is even worse but both of those things look good in comparison to the acting this is the sort of movie that they should make people in prison watch guarantee you if criminals thought that they would be subjected to this film they would never break the law again
not sure should be writing review of the witches of eastwick because not sure just what the hell pardon the expression was going on in it however can express the most important observation made of it didn like it if had to summarize this film think conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal that the kernel of it anyway tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women feminism the role of the devil modern reformers and friendship unfortunately little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts they re simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace actually think that most of the audience was even more confused than was they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy on the level of ghostbusters and were bit confused to be getting folk tale with philosophical overtones they laughed or tried to laugh at moments that were either barely funny or much more horrible than funny as if that could bend the film away from it rather frightening direction three women cher susan sarandon and michelle pfieffer live in eastwick small midwestern town one night while drinking late into the evening they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives in seeming answer to their idle daydreams wealthy eccentric moves into mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be he soon shows evidence of mystical perhaps demonic power and his devotion to the women merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones even worse when ignored his moods become ugly and he mistreats the women for spurning him anyway the problems all three female characters are fairly uninteresting and several are cardboard stereotypes especially sarandon character we never get inside them never feel sympathetic to them because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland as for nicholson well even the devil needs direction to go in and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie due to the grace of the screenwriter and more importantly nicholson acting he still can be yanked in one direction and then another without making him little vague and then there the special effects not in themselves they weren that good but their overuse was almost positive until saw the credits that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl because of the big name actors in dopy stunts or stephen spielberg after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholson blown down the street stunt nope it another bunch of guys and directed by george miller who has shown great skill with stunts special effects before the road warrior nightmare at 20 00 feet episode of twilight zone the movie but apparently doesn know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act gawds sake guys this is jack nicholson let him loose let him grin demonically skip the splitting earth and fake lightning watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll all could think of was what waste if you re going to use slapstick like that use it up on pee wee herman nicholson does what he can with the role and when he can find his bearings can be extremely good the scene in the church for instance but most of the time he seems bit stiff as if he not sure what he should be doing next and no wonder this script goes all over the map giving you the feeling that it just love to be allegory but it not sure about what maybe if you give it time it ll think of something so what is the witches of eastwick horror movie folk tale comedy statement about women an examination of the religious right or comparitive morality tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me watching someone regurgitate half digested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms people the screen and ultimately the audience in other words mess $2 00 if you like nicholson enough to watch him here maybe 25% of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others
the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes alas it refers to our heroes as it turns out the alien race that sends computer virus to earth via the mir space station thinks of the human race as virus perhaps even cancer that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further after all we have taken up this entire planet and if they let us live for another billion years or so we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one but the human race doesn have much to worry about after all there woman named foster jamie lee curtis out there stopping the computer virus she the chief navigator on sea vessel travelling with her is captain everton donald sutherland steve baker william baldwin woods marshall bell squeaky julio oscar mechoso and richie sherman augustus they re all sailing in typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters lucky for us we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board the evil captain everton thinks he going to take the ship in and get reward he convinces his crew that there going to be big money so they try to salvage the ship soon however when it apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power they realize that something bad must have happened finally they meet nadia joanna pacula who explains their situation computer virus has taken over the ship it creating bio mechanical life forms to eliminate the human race virus is truly dumb action thriller one of negligible intelligence and innovation when considering the entire film you will realize that it lacks single original scene it direct rip off of nearly every james cameron film aliens the abyss and the terminator films are the most plagiarized more importantly it basically the same movie as last year deep rising liked deep rising simply because it funny it knows it silly and derivative virus takes itself seriously and in the most serious manner possible it steals from every good and bad film of the genre showing you countless familiar scenes and sporting cookie cutter plot that any film of the sci fi horror genre could fit with little trimming but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out okay let me get this straight the alien race which is never really explained is basically sentient electricity they need to make themselves physical so they use space station to get onto ship which is surrounded by water but who cares about that on the ship they make bunch of clunky immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people after that they start using the dead people to create half human half machine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around the leader of course is big creature every film like this has big creature at the end but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around virus is indeed cliched film but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn very threatening it established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there on one level virus is almost passable fun it really gory and few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal the director john bruno worked on lot of cameron films there also nice array of actors even though none of them do any acting except for donald sutherland who does lot of very bad acting the bottom line however is this virus is bad movie it rips off lot of good movies that are worth seeing in that order recommend that you rent any one of the alien films simply to admire the qualities of creature that actually threatens our heroes
an american werewolf in paris is failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis 1981 feature an american werewolf in london where the original had comedy the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit coms where the first installment had chills this one has sequences that are inappropriately unintentionally funny in short while an american werewolf in london has become something of minor classic in its genre the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity the film opens with trio of daredevil americans andy tom everett scott brad vince vieluf and chris phil buckman sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do little bungee jumping soon they have company in the person of serafine julie delpy who has decided to end it all she jumps but andy with bungee cord attached goes after her and manages to save her at the price of major headache serafine disappears but smitten andy seeks her out however once he learns his would be girlfriend dark secret he wishes he hadn she werewolf cursed to change into hideous beast when the moon is full and to make matters worse he has suffered nasty bite himself actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie she imbues serafine with spirit spunk and humanity which gives us an emotional stake in the character fate this isn necessarily good thing since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as completely mindless campy entertainment experience delpy injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with better script and better cast surrounding her delpy previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski beyaz and richard linklater before sunrise she was radiant charismatic and effective in both given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here she gets as close as possible to those adjectives it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one miss and if your primary objective is catching glimpse of her in the buff check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts the rest of the cast acts at level considerably below that of delpy which is to say they give performances appropriate for the screenplay tom everett scott that thing you do plays the lead like he in made for tv movie it would be kind to call him bland actors vince vieluf and phil buckman as andy friends are no more impressive julie bowen happy gilmore is suitably fetching as werewolf meat and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has brief turn as another monster meal on the technical side it all bad news the computer generated werewolves look painfully unreal the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits repeated use is made of the werewolf cam an infrared wolf point of view approach that interesting the first couple of times it employed then becomes tedious and the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on screen action they re matched to director anthony waller who displayed confident edgy style in mute witness stumbles with this material never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel as result we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii your sister is werewolf will give waller credit for killing off dog though something that rarely seen in movies these days an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in bad movie sort of way but that dubious distinction ultimately it an unfortunate effort for while it isn unbearable to sit through it isn howl either
depending on who you ask the original sin was either the eating of the apple the act of disobedience against god or the act of betrayal but in case you didn know this don bother remembering it the words original sin never come up in the movie of the same name let alone the concept of it the closest the film even gets to catholicism is in its narrative the story is told by angelina jolie to her priest while on death row in cuba circa 1900 regardless of its senseless title original sin does actually have plot albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war based on the book waltz across darkness boy antionio banderas places personal ad sometime around 1900 searching for wife since this is century ago we narrowly dodge remake of green card only to find that the girl jolie faked her photo and is actually beautiful skipping few moderately useless sex scenes getting the question out of the way yes we get to see angelina jolie breasts again the girl turns out to be con artist swindles boy for his money and heads for the hills original sin then briefly tries to be thriller we see boy go whore chasing saying he wants to find girl and kill her but as soon as boy actually finds girl instead of following what might have been promising or at least not completely fucking boring thriller the film degenerates into the worst dissection of the virgin whore complex since milk money girl toys with the idea of reforming her con girl past all the while avoiding the other man lover that keeps making her start these scams in the first place add insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history literally half of the film is either in slow motion or uses strobe effect and acting roughly the caliber of gun and original sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year don even bother with original sin but if you do go be honest with yourself and admit its pure sex appeal just keep in mind that although this film may not be the most original on the block it much worse than sin this is sacrilege
wizards is an animated feature that begins with narration of epic proportions over siyah and beyaz drawings we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation induced mutation the original inhabitants of the earth fairies and elves return to populate the globe along with their evil mutant counterparts one day and say one day not to be trite but because that exactly how it happened no advance notice fairy queen gives birth to twins one good and one evil the twins grow up to be powerful wizards the good one embracing magic and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology as unoriginal as the premise is was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out there lot you can do in an animated fantasy world after all soon learned however that the fantasy was the expectation of decent film once the transition was made from still art to color animation an entirely different feel takes precedence rather than the epic saga promised by the narration we get goofy looking world of saturday morning cartoon not just the look mind you but all the zany sounds like >honk boing for years blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined however blackwolf now has secret weapon nazis yup adolf hitler the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht okay not the real things but an archival film his minions dug up projected into the sky for all to see it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up before you know it there are dead elves everywhere this is just as well the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn care about any of them they re either silly sappy or both the dialog gets much of the credit for this an example is when avatar nonchalantly says well looks like my brother and begin our final battle not very formidable when he also the guy who says this is the biggest bummer of trip ve ever been on my favorite line was from sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can fight back against the nazi charged evil her response is they have weapons and technology we just have love suffice to say the characters are strictly two dimensional and we therefore don expect anything more than the obvious to happen which it does the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out which is anticlimactic and disappointing please note that it is the action that is unexpected that it is disappointing is not the film couldn settle on particular mood it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity the dramatics which seem to occur at random are overly staged and overly acted detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned ralph bakshi the director makes an obvious attempt to get message across in this film hitler and the nazis were bad so who doesn know this already well maybe children okay so you might say that this is movie for children it not in the scenes where good fights evil there lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they re watching cartoon so is the film for adults if so we probably don need to be bashed over the head to get the point why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know wizards gives us lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes and hitler giving speeches however we don see any reason why they should be considered bad we see no atrocities being committed not even any real battle footage there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich and we re not even given cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place this needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if point were to be made since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere at any time and we must therefore be vigilant however not sure if want to give him that much credit
inspired by the 1958 film house on haunted hill starring vincent price directed by william malone starring geoffrey rush famke janssen and chris kattan rated contains violence profanity and brief nudity synopsis eccentric millionaire price offers $1 000 000 to each of his guests who appear at gathering at former sanitarium the only catch is that they have to survive the night at the establishment an establishment haunted by its former staff and patients comments house on haunted hill is based upon the original 1958 film of the same title directed by william castle and starring vincent price in an obvious homage the millionaire name is price and he sports thin mustache like price used to have this is pretty bad horror film yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining and house on haunted hill is just such film it is surprisingly better than another recent haunted house remake the haunting film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson the haunting had literary pretensions and fell flat on it face house on haunted hill owes its lineage to movie 40 years old and makes no illusion that it crappy horror movie thus somehow it proves slightly more successful can think of another recent film which has had such an eclectic cast it is this cast which lifts this ho hum thriller into borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror price the main character is played by geoffrey rush the academy award winning actor of shine rush seems to be making downward spiral in the movie industry spiral reminiscent of ben ghandi schindler list kingsley ridiculous appearance in the camp sci fi classic species don know why but sometimes it entertaining to see quality actors in bad movies more surprises rising star taye diggs plays stereotypical african american sports figure rather lamely too and singer lisa loeb appears as tv news reporter the highlight of the cast however has to be saturday night live member chris kattan kattan comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor of the former sanitarium while the first half of the film leaves the audience guessing as to what exactly going on the second half dissolves into standard ghost story stuff and loses some of its suspense disappointingly cheesy ending really mars this movie too house on haunted hill suspect has just about left the second run theaters it worth catching on cable next year if you get chance if you have choice pick this movie over the haunting it the better of two evils you could say though more appropriately perhaps it be better to say that it the better of two turkeys
capsule liebes meets tod this was film about sex and death morgue attendant accidentally revives dead woman through necrophilia and brings her into his world which is heavy on orgies this film says something obscure about the relationship of sex and death but imparts no insights to make matter worse this print was poorly subtitled into english from french to +4 an attractive 18 year old dies on disco floor and gets sent to morgue one of the attendants ben jean marc barr is so attracted by her that he attempts necrophilia we see him crawling away after shock in the middle of sex the dead teen has come back to life the morgue attendant was just adding new form of sex to his collection of kinks he was already part of group that gets together for sex the revived teen teresa elodie bouchez joins them moral dilemma of teresa father ben has abused his daughter body but in doing so has saved her life part of this opaque allegory is man saved from suicide who joins in the sexual hijinx also involved is man in the final stages of dying of aids close friend of the morgue attendant he does not get involved in the orgies the subtitles of our print were beyaz often on beyaz background making them often hard to read but don think there was whole lot of meaning there that was lost the title means don let me die on sunday
you know that movie has issues when most everyone in the audience comes out laughing and it not comedy and what strange career path for director chuck russell he starts his career off with decent take on the nightmare on elm street series with his debut as director on installment number three he follows that up with the blob the very next year but waits another six years to do his next piece little film called the mask starring jim carrey and then one more star vehicle in eraser two years after that so then he thought let me wait another five years get weak script jammed with cliches and hope that jimmy smits and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes strange dude and one crappy flick plot six year old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side while the girl aunt wants to well save her from those damn devil worshippers enter one occult expert agent plenty of bobo cops and lots of nuns praying and you ve just about got the gist of things here critique with plot holes the size of my ass this movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich ridden plot with wasted talent cheezy effects bad dialogue and unintentional laughs to boot what good about this movie well rufus sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of creepy runaway children shelter satanist supreme with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around the little girl is also pretty good but unfortunately her character doesn really do all that much and believe it or not was actually enjoying some of the film first half hour which starts off with some promise but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist basinger just drown the film entire basis of believability for some reason it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted and even longer to figure out that every move that she makes is dumb one add that to the entire police force of incompetents save for jimmy smits whose talent agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd mavi would be good career move at least change the clothes jimmy zero scares zero thrills and even less actual drama and you ve got yourself pretty bad movie and why would respected actors like christina ricci and ian holm take bit parts in this movie did they owe the director favor or something together they barely have five minutes of screen time but suppose that ricci hospital room scene might be worth look for some of you horn dogs the worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending which features police officers coming up with the brilliant idea of sneaking up on man house who they know to be guilty of crime uuuhmm how about knocking on the door and arresting his sorry ass officers anyway don usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews but the stupidity of some of these characters is just too difficult to describe without validating it with solid idiotic proof and there was plenty to go around and did basinger lose some of her acting talent during her hiatus from the profession after her 1997 oscar win difficult to say if it was her lines that were really bad or if she just delivered them poorly either way little originality very obvious computer effects little thrills little drama and very little entertainment value certainly bestow the honor of one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film but if you really don mind rehashed gobbledygook of various satanic and kid based thrillers and enjoy watching films that don bring anything new to the table well drink some beers smoke some beans and rent this video because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year
adam sandler vehicles are never anything special but continue to make load of money which really goes to show the sad state of cinema today while good comedies like rushmore to choose recent example gets limited release and doesn make lot of money big daddy got huge release and has made lot of cash it also nothing special and doesn deserve the money it making but digress sandler plays sonny koufax unemployed new yorker with seemingly low mental age his girlfriend makes ultimatum to him either wise up and get responsible or she leaving him by strange set of events koufax ends up with julian played by twins cole and dylan sprouse five year old kid after failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with the child koufax decides he wants to keep the child however social worker mr brooks mostel finds out that koufax isn the real father and wants to take julian back koufax along with his new girlfriend layla lauren adams fight to keep the child big daddy really isn that good many of the jokes revolve around toilet humour and supposedly we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against wall to be funny there the occasional good one liner but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour the film after all these silly gags then suddenly turns sentimental and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous the court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable and not helped by the soppy overacting it poor attempt to win over the audience adam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films except the wedding singer joey lauren adams is much much better and deserves far better film than this trash steve buscemi pops up in funny cameo and his scenes are pretty funny rob schneider is also funny as crazy delivery man the two twins who play julian are they start out rather well but then becoming annoying and brattish halfway through and finally turn all american wholesome goodness at the end of the film where the tear juice is turned up high big daddy is really nothing special and is not even worth it for few chuckles although it is actually well put together with nice direction good production design and even some montages this professionalism can help the fact that the script and characters are trash big daddy is for die hard fans of sandler and that about it
deserves recognition for making this relatively youthful critic feel extremely old and crotchety20 capsule review this is what feel good family entertainment has morphed into in the 90 an hour and half commercial disguised as an unnecessary remake in which the defining image is that of grown man launching volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass between this rocketman and george of the jungle disney has recently eclipsed longtime champion troma as the studio most likely to include fart joke in film as the absent minded professor who invents the titular computer generated goop listless robin williams manages the difficult task of making original lead fred macmurray seem sprightly the only thing that made this film borderline tolerable for me is my newly founded but firm belief that writer producer john hughes is going to spend his eternal afterlife being conked in the noggin by all of the different blunt instruments he used for comedic effect in films like this and the odious home alone series take your kids to see boogie nights instead
any movie that kills emilio estevez off in the first fifteen minutes has something going for it unfortunately this and the familiar theme music are the only worthwhile things about mission impossible directed by brian depalma the first problem is that this film has absolutely no connection with the tv show whatsoever aside from the music the tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork orchestrated by jim phelps allowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world teamwork was the key this film is set up as cross between james bond and depalma blow out where the john travolta character was the victim of real and imagined conspiracies from all directions it was travolta vulnerability that made that film so exciting and claustrophobic in this film tom cruise is basically omniscient believe that and so there no fun going on here whatsoever the story is about as contrived as contrived gets and is full of holes there are basically two memorable sequences one involves breaking into kubrickesque computer room task that could have been made much easier had the characters whit of common sense suffice it to say that the alarm system is disengaged when the computer operator is in the room the second involves high speed train helicopter and the chunnel and does not have to be seen to be disbelieved the actors are all miscast especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife who cannot act and ving rhames as computer hacker who looks lost and embarrased to be in this movie tom cruise is no james bond and jon voight looks more like bobby the brain heenan than jim phelps brian depalma career has been bafflingly erratic at his best he beats hitchcock at his own game blow out carrie body double but this is not his best the screenplay was partly written by robert towne who wrote the best scenario of the seventies in chinatown but this script is perfunctory at best and terrrible at worst the cinematography has comic book red blue emphasis which is nice to look at but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed and this movie even features the old killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving the victim time to think of an escape trick please don spend your money on this it ll only encourage hollywood to make more
movies based on video games such as street fighter or mario bros have never generated much interest at the box office but when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 it did surprisingly well with simple story pulsating soundtrack and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy it got my vote for the movie where expected the least and got the most and if you haven had the opportunity would definitely recommend that you see it on video in the world of mortal kombat based on the popular arcade game dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity the mortal kombat refers to competition fought by human mortals against outworld minions which if won will guarantee earth safety for another generation mk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition despite their victory however gateway has somehow opened and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth outworld warriors include an impressive collection of fighters including shao kahn mintoro centaur sheeva four armed ogre and sindel earth mortal warriors under the leadership of the benevolent god lord rayden includes liu kang princess kitana sonya blade and jax who must fight against outworld forces it an easy enough premise but unfortunately very unfortunately the writers try to do too much with the movie it is only video game after all but the on screen version tries to go beyond it comic book boundaries by adding depth conceptualization of self worth and worst of all love story this becomes very awkward because all of the players are fighters and nothing more they are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act this becomes embarrassingly apparent for example as the movie tries to develop romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana the original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best they spoke little but fought lot thus the movie was easy to digest however mk2 tries to give these players certain amount of depth an element that was lacking in the first movie but the attempt here fails miserably this uneasy feeling is readily apparent for example whenever you hear lord rayden speak not only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic useless advice but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom try reading this half as fast and you ll hear what mean but the movie is not complete fatality fight scenes are well choreographed highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility and players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game although their screen time amounts to nothing more than cameo even if you re not familiar with the video game each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves but it just too little of what movie goers and especially fans of the game will expect oddly the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence and the poor acting results in muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom rent the first one but the sequel is for kombat fans only
if you don think kevin kline in drag is funny wait til you see will smith in drag it even less funny by the time jim west smith disguised himself as belly dancer to bail his captured comrade artemus gordon kline from the clutches of evil dr loveless branagh was unequivocally bored by wild wild west the new summer blockbuster from men in siyah director barry sonnenfeld is the old west really breeding ground for high comedy anyway if your answer is no then you recall rustler rhapsody or back to the future part iii if your answer is yes you re thinking of blazing saddles but that movie was parody of the western genre not nineteenth century romp 1869 jim west is quick draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon under orders from president grant kline again whose impression for all we know is dead on to apprehend legless loveless the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states and sell it back to britain and spain how will loveless accomplish this well by hulking around the desert in an enormous mechanical tarantula of course bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar hayek whose scientist father was kidnapped by loveless joins west and gordon on their gadget filled train gordon first discovers rita in cage waiting to be rescued racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically with west despite the movie hip attitude toward the siyah thing west automatically shoots anyone who calls him nigger before that person can finish speaking the word super at any rate kept waiting for rita to say something humourous but she walking dress up toy her single comic moment is also the best shot of the film she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peek boo flap of her pyjamas jim west is the role that finally stymied will smith whose comic timing has always been hit or miss as episodes of the fresh prince of bel air demonstrate smith better reactor than actor which is why he was so thoroughly engaging in men in black he didn start out hero in wild wild west he required to exude eastwood cool and amuse at the same time and from frame one difficult feat not sure any living performer could pull off smith is ill equipped for example to handle the moment in which jim west performs stand up for some rednecks at his own hanging what attracted sonnenfeld to this material this isn the first time he has adapted tv show for the big screen the addams family anyone but it the first big stinker of his career as director wild wild west is poorly paced bombast full of doa gags ted levine shows up as general who uses gramophone horn for hearing aid levine played buffalo bill in the silence of the lambs he too intense to get an intentional laugh lousy special effects the bluescreening is amateurish foregrounds are never proportionate to the backgrounds and frequent illogic to wit its ridiculous villain so badly wants jim west out of the way that he drops him onto steel platform to do battle with some generic ugly henchmen instead of shooting him at point blank rage with one of the many guns on board the tarantula wild wild west bright spots such as the cool opening credits sequence bai ling all too brief appearance as femme fatale or the brilliant his master voice joke are all part of the film first half which is more clever and enjoyable at least than its second when towards what seemed like the end of wild wild west gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane and west rejects it there was collective groan among audience members it meant we were going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before gordon builds the glider the invention of which would inevitably lead to the proverbial whiz bang finale
if you have ever seen fox tv special car chase programs you ll have good idea about the content of ronin the new action thriller from director john frankenheimer the film involves mysterious briefcase that several groups of terrorist want to get their hands on an irish women dierdre played by the truman show natascha mcelhone hires group of mercenaries to assist her in getting the briefcase among the people she hires are sam robert de niro vincent jean reno and gregor stellan skarsg rd from good will hunting dierdre groups assignment is too seize the briefcase while the current owners are transporting it they accomplish this task but traitor is in the bunch and the briefcase is soon on the run again the briefcase stays on the run as the movie leads the viewer through several plot twists that are badly executed the writer seemed to be attempting to make smart action movie but failed to understand that just because there are surprises it doesn add too the credibility of senseless script the plot twists get no reaction because they come at time where no one cares what is going on after the apparent climax of the film but to add to the excitement as mentioned earlier there are endless car chase scenes they are unrealistic and fail to add anything to the story don get me wrong love car chases but they were overdone and too long here we never do find out what in the briefcase but doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller
the happy bastard quick movie review wild wild west better name for this movie might ve been wild wild waste warner bros in an attempt to get their own men in siyah style of movie had managed to lasso in some big names actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld the duo behind mib success in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster contemporary big screen update to the classic western sci fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad but somehow they ran into problem along the way they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would ve made all the difference story writer wild wild west story and script was compiled by six different people rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in siyah ed solomon if warner bros had gotten him the movie would ve possibly been five times better than what it is heck ten times as is however the story and screenplay is mess filled with dead laughs enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he performing them and complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well here the story us army member james west will smith teams up with creative genius artemus gordon kevin kline to take on ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless kenneth branagh whose lower half was blown off during the civil war leaving him to roll around in steam controlled wheelchair they catch onto plot of his involving superweapon that can basically be considered an 80 foot tarantula although it looks bigger than that hellbent on destroying anything in its path as said the way the script unfolds is complete mess but the acting doesn help either kevin kline is miserable as gordon failing to display even smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado smith seems to be having better time as west although he not nearly as charming as he was in mib branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain perhaps to the point where we can even stand to look at him or his strange beard and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father but mostly she exists just for sexual attention her acting is barely passable but what breath of fresh ass director barry sonnenfeld isn of great help either even though he shows some good creativity at some points his overall urgency for directing is lost it as if he feels he directing tv movie big no no when you re helming what supposed to be big screen hit last but not least there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable at one point smith defies gravity when first boarding kline train he jumps on the back gets launched straight up in the air and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train while it still in motion also he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of lynch mob particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks last but not least why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he not kissing woman as he looking through peephole at the enemy the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects the huge mechanical spider is technical marvel very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show there also good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades but again logic question comes into play regarding their polarity would say sit back and have good time with wild wild west but it really isn possible if the racist and sex jokes don bother you the performances will if the performances don bother you the story will if the story doesn bother you the racist and sex jokes will there no end to the vicious circle go rent men in siyah instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats you ll have better time if you do go keep an eye out for robert conrad in role as president grant bet he wishes he were somewhere else
old soldiers never die they just turn into cliches soldier film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body jungian archetypes these two opposites need each other to create whole but it difficult to integrate both often we ll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and with the help of jung magician sit around imagining grand schemes without the drive to manifest their plans much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness all they have are dreams warriors on the other hand are ready to go to war at the drop of hat and will do combat with every last bit of their energy they don care enough about anything to know what worth fighting for gladiators who live only for the battle this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know but can also illustrate societies america during the late sixties was conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers todd 3465 kurt russell is living breathing archetype chosen from birth as soldier he is raised by the government to be killing machine his childhood is cruelty and competition he is indoctrinated with the big rules never question authority winning is everything strength beats knowledge veteran of numerous intergalactic wars todd is 40 and he obsolete new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger left for dead after test battle with the best of the new killers caine 607 jason scott lee he unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 garbage world obviously our hero is still alive he finds group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health when the peace loving colonists get good look at who todd is they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world they are the other good guys these lovers find that they need warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons todd finds himself in the role of protector what could have been fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra right wing future is ruined by turning the film into cartoon the effects are mostly second rate explosions or jerky slow motion the plot is old hat we don get even glimpse at the society that created the soldiers hardly anything makes sense the film science fares badly with all the remarkable advances we ve made in just 37 years the film takes place in 2036 we re still stupid after conquering the stars for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to landfill light years away even stranger the garbage barges appear to double as time machines virtually all the trash is vintage 1960 there is nothing in the story that is not predictable the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra connie nielsen the woman just little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him it doesn take genius to foresee that her husband isn going to be around much longer is it shock to find out that the film climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine who would you guess wins some of the scenes would work if this were comedy todd first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie nipple poking through her thin blouse later as he sits by his lonely campfire tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion supposedly this clich isn meant to be humorous dastardly col mekum jason isaacs with pencil thin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash responsible for last year quirky and visually enticing but problematic the fifth element director paul anderson sees the film as shane in outer space maybe if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode the movie doesn even work as an action film there is never question as to the outcome somehow the new superior soldiers don prove much of match for todd the acting isn anything to write home about nielsen almost comes across as real person but is soon relegated to background victim russell is buffed up and does credible job but it not much of challenge uttering around 100 words during the film mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space gary busey as todd commanding officer is completely wasted in his low key role everything blows up and occasionally it looks cool sometimes the sets are impressive unfortunately occasionally and sometimes don make film most disappointing is that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote blade runner possibly the best science fiction movie ever made sharp eyed viewers will notice few obscure references to that film peoples says that this is not blade runner sequel but sidequel that takes place in the same universe although that may have been the intent in his original script the result is more like bad television series that the blade runner replicants watch to pass time perhaps those artificial humans would find this entertaining michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and wants to wish everyone an appropriate halloween whatever you like it to be
what is this homicide or bad movie that is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie let me clear things up for you cupcake this isn bad movie it really bad movie so bad it almost good almost but not quite the movie starts off in the 1950 with space aliens sending botched experiment down to earth it is bunch of slug like creatures that kill people and take over their bodies the slugs first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody that is until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986 he and the slugs inside him promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more co eds into slug zombies slightly crazed cop tom atkins and the requisite girl with the face of an angel jill whitlow join these two geeky university students jason lively and steve marshall to do battle with the slugs it more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs the acting is bad with capital the story is worse and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in home movie the only saving grace was the requisite tit shot courtesy of jill whitlow it had absolutely nothing to do with the story but liked it actually it was the high point of the movie for me of course that isn really saying much the story moves around in hap hazard fashion which gives it leg up on some other horror films unlike most movies of this genre there actually is story not great one but it is there this is one in long line of movies from the 1980 that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the 13th halloween and nightmare on elm street movies you could randomly select movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better but night of the creeps might make nice addition to movie horror marathon just don be too upset if you can find it you really won be missing that much
there scene early on in jawbreaker where character utters the unintentionally prophetic line that is so not funny how right she was this pathetic tale of three high schoolers who accidentally kill their best friend in birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry is never even remotely funny or fun or original not content with the too obvious heathers heisting the filmmakers proceed to lift freely from staggering variety of sources including carrie bride of frankenstein mavi velvet and even shaw pygmalion itself recently remade as she all that jawbreaker is pastiche and not even an enjoyable one find it extremely telling that the most engaging part of the film is the credit sequence jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by veruca salt volcano girls serving as blueprint for the rest of the film the song has absolutely nothing to do with the footage we re watching just close your eyes and pretend you re listening to an alt rock station you won be missing anything the blame for mess this big has to be spread around among the principals rebecca gayheart following roles in scream and urban legend should have known better than to take yet another role in yet another teen body count movie pam grier has totally wasted any credibility she might have gotten from her role in quentin tarantino jackie brown and rose mcgowan should just quit acting she has no charisma no presence and no acting skills other than rolling her eyes and looking disaffected mcgowan manages to be upstaged by her real life boyfriend rocker marilyn manson whose fifteen second role here is far more interesting than anything any of the real actors are doing manson sans trademark makeup contact lenses and with an obviously fake moustache looks eerily like nicholas cage who woulda thunk it that crack about direction by committee wasn merely pithy sound bite stylistically thematically narratively jawbreaker is all over the map varying wildly in tone content from scene to scene though credited solely to writer director darren stein one gets the feeling that no two scenes here were actually guided by the same hands if stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this atrocity someone needs to get the man some drugs pronto prozac lithium kava ritalin something anything he quite obviously in desperate need of chemical help jawbreaker is monumental waste of effort and resources and quite likely one of the single worst films ve ever seen to call jawbreaker garbage would be to insult garbage bad flicks for the rest of the year are safe ve already got my pick for worst film of 99 jawbreaker runs approximately 90 minutes though it feels longer than titanic and is rated for language sexual situations and graphic violence not recommended for kids teens or anyone else
can you say dated you can if you ve seen rosemary baby which like the exorcist was thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release mystery science theater 3000 has skewered the bad films of the past but let me tell you it could do number on the good ones too rosemary baby stars mia farrow from the time she was actually good looking as an innocent housewife and her not so innocent husband john cassavettes an actor who takes an easy albeit evil road to success it all seems so harmless in the beginning mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed there also skull in the living room but it only for decoration their elderly neighbors pop in for housewarming all well for about the first hour of this slow moving film until mia eats some of the neighbors chocolate mousse and passes out when she comes to she finds herself in darkened room with bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and big evil man raping her foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen it seems like dream and when she finds herself pregnant she almost forgets about it and everyone helping with the pregnancy the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink good luck charm for her to wear around her neck and the name of an obstetrician who been in the business 66 years meanwhile mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing lot of weight before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries that when you know your health failing the only person in the movie who the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend maurice evans who calls mia up to give her the bad news and immediately falls into coma by about the two hour mark felt the same way rosemary baby is way too long and leads up to payoff that about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie guess someone put spell on this movie
the 44 caliber killer has struck again starring john leguizamo mira sorvino adrian brody jennifer esposito michael rispoli bebe neuwirth rated summer of sam will be remembered as waste of spike lee abilities lee is great filmmaker often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg but here he gets himself into bind his latest effort is case of director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work the summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city it was the hottest summer on record to boot new york first serial killer was on the loose calling himself the son of sam david berkowitz killed people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population so it was understandable that when nyc was hit with citywide blackout people went berserk causing billions of dollars in damage to the city the movie focus is on group of twenty somethings during that fateful summer vinny john leguizamo club hopping adultrous hairdresser his benevolent wife dionna mira sorvino looking young ritchie adrian brody punk who becomes an outcast as well as son of sam suspect gang of small time mobsters and few more minor characters we follow them through their roller coaster lives thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him make him stay faithful to her ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more eccentric and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam first murder looms the night he promises he will strike again local gang with too much time on its hands makes list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects at the top of the list is ritchie vinny an unwilling part of the said group is called upon to set trap for his friend as we watch these proceedings some of which are painfully graphic the dreaded so what question springs to mind from the way this movie is made have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something but as searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find lee touches on so much the media the 70 punk scene the details of the actual killings as well as the characters very personal dilemmas but he doesn bring all of his topics together to form coherent theme or make discernible statement all is not lost if movie turns out to be hollow it can be saving grace for the film to be enjoyable too bad summer of sam doesn get any help here frankly it bore redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn entertain beyond its first half hour there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague leguizamo turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny the script makes it clear that we re supposed to believe that his character is flawed but still good guy you never guess from his performance adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better sorvino gives riveting touching performance in banal movie tempted to think that liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane her character is affecting and her emotions true to heart brody too paints an effective portrait of young guy desperate for attention who gets little more than he bargained for summer of sam has some superficial elements of good film it looks great it has few notable performances and suppose it pretty well directed in purely technical way but it also empty pretentious and boring like last year the thin kirmizi line it movie by director who doesn know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway 1999 eugene novikov&#137
wow film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever amazed that someone thought this was story that must be told on screen many blacks in hollywood complain that they are not nominated for awards based on their race think first they need to concentrate their energy on themselves and stop making movies which makes them look like nothing more than sex crazed buffoons even offended by it bill bellamy is player which means he sleeps with lot of women and lies to them what pleasant main character one day his friends decide that they want to find out how to be player why they decide this one day have no idea how many years have they been friends and why all of sudden would they want to learn anyway bellamy agrees to teach and his wonderful lesson to his friends consists of letting them ride in his car while he rides from house to house having sex with women this is the bulk of the film folks guys riding from house to house one keeps getting out to have sex while the others sit in the car since russell simmons is producer and since the official title of the film is def jam how to be player was ready to be jumping up and down and stomping my feet and beating the person next to me because of the comedy amazingly aside from gilbert gottfried 90 seconds of screen time there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such manner instead of jokes there just an endless stream of profanity and naked breasts and naked breasts aren so bad but naked breasts alone don make good movie be sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well gilbert gottfried character serves as one in his very brief appearance asking for explanations as to what is being said they should have brought him along for the entire film [r]

the summer of 00 wasn very good one for devout cinephiles it offered no blair witches or sixth senses the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient men adaptation and flawed but entertaining shaft update nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of potentially brighter fall movie season that battery charging at least for critics who have to sit through every piece shit that moseys into multiplexes time of year when all those oscar contenders read quality films compete for audiences alas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season it also indie director neil labute first attempt at something resembling mainstream picture and sad to report it resounding failure at least on this web site mess that as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labute previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic went in expecting something decent for betty was gleefully praised it screenplay even winning an award at cannes but exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment are critics so desperate for something unique that they re blind to how derivative the particular brand of uniqueness betty dolls out is for the first time labute is working from script he has not written and he seems unsure of how to handle the material betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction this is another flick featuring pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men enchanting like the wizard of oz of which this film makes several allusions to and heartwarming like [stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie] but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation it labute half hearted attempt to make crowd pleaser and he doesn even seem to have half that heart in it nurse betty concerns soap opera addict betty brilliantly played by renee zellweger who witnesses the killing of her husband del aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of mad housewife by two hit men morgan freeman and chris rock she happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities she blocked out her husband death and thinks she character in her favorite soap reason to love betty sets out on the road to la with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk searching for her soap boyfriend dr david ravell greg kinnear while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit the labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men slipped bit but not much with his sophomore effort your friends and neighbors then fell straight on his ass with bash play he penned that was recently aired on showtime the play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist only labute persistence in wallowing in the horrid things average people do to each other usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are in the play paul rudd as an obnoxious jock delivers monologue detailing how he once followed gay man into bathroom and beat him maybe to death while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim boys will be boys another character schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby what was once so powerful about labute work the casual nonchalant cruelty and selfishness often elements we all have in us amplified to disgusting degree had become so over the top it was borderline comic obviously at this point labute could use dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further but nurse betty isn it he clearly has little passion for what he doing here instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks one of the hit men is huge soap fan and the character of betty would be little more than one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn managed to transcend that tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience nearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down as the two are made to enact soft boiled tarantino esque dialogue they evince little chemistry with rock constantly in over the top rant mode acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling hit man an occupation that represented far too frequently in movies nowadays think rock is great comic yet he hasn been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies whenever he acts and no matter the part it like he doing the damn chris rock show surprisingly at least considering her work in me myself and irene renee zellweger gives revelatory performance building on her baby faced apple pie looks that wide open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests little girl not fully grown into her thirty year old body it the best work she ever done freeman is effective as always though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it the actor plays the role in his usual calm collected manner though the flick tries to insinuate symbolic kinship between his character and betty suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality that interesting but the movie doesn do anything with it other than crash land the sub theme into labored speech in the midst of badly staged gun battle the film has good moments many of the scenes involving very good greg kinnear especially his confrontation with zellweger an almost soothing lyrical score and you know movie in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it but nothing jells it parts good or bad are so disparate as to be opposing the film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film mainstream female forrest gump or an oddball art film but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke betty screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence without which betty wouldn make any progress in the film nurse betty is film driven by coincidence rather than charter like how betty becomes nurse in the film job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim wound because she happened to see how on tv which leads to her being offered room with the victim girlfriend who eventually gets betty into party where she meets kinnear little too tidy don tcha think betty has an interesting theme though it doesn even seem aware of this the current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother with more on the way this is film about women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ironically real life survivor sean kennif has taken part as doctor on the soap opera guiding light instead of exploring this timely matter in way relating to the current tv craze since the film does largely appear to be satire of television albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the 80s than the 00s the film simply uses betty delusions as plot device to get her from point to no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use bit of rest and lot of contemplation
what do you get when you rip off good movies like woody allen bananas and martin scorsese after hours you think you get the best of both films instead you get woo falling in somewhere between def jam how to be player which was awful and booty call which was ok woo is yet another in the embarassing genre of showing african americans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons the whole film plays out as siyah version of after hours as wild woman woo jada pinkett smith goes out on blind date with straight laced tim tommy davidson mayhem follows them for some unknown reason read contrived screenplay davidson puts up with all of woo antics for the entire night which include her destroying his bathroom mirror stealing things from his house violently questioning him accusing and belittling him actually about previous girlfriends causing riot in an elegant restaurant and other various infuriating things that any normal person wouldn tolerate but for the sake of this bad movie sure why not there are few chuckles in the film the best being the scene swiped directly from bananas in this case davidson is running from thugs gets into subway car as the doors are closing starts to taunt the thugs then the doors open back up again good joke but stolen one another chuckle is provided by billy dee williams cameo as himself movies like woo are seemingly released every three months or so and not one of them has ever been hit woo won be one either so why was it made and more importantly isn there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive everyone involved should really reconsider their careers at this point [r]
wild things is way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day provided of course that you re the victim of frontal lobotomy there is in fact no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at movie goers in their late teens and early twenties the most lucrative target group this is film noir for the mtv generation fast paced slick flashy gleefully mindless and hollow to the core wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 ve seen more convincing drama with nearly as much bare flesh on that pinnacle of narrative quality baywatch wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it thriller with real story what it is however is series of increasingly improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists everything in between those serpentine moments is filler flash of breast spatter of blood and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of steven seagal movie the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess just take stab at the most unlikely thing to happen and that will probably be it using this approach was right three times and wrong only once that not good average for production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what around the next corner the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie the hot young cast and the old standby sex both have an abundance of screen time although ll admit that the film erotic content is somewhat less impressive than expected nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu the soft core sex sequences are generic and don generate much heat the lesbian kisses can hold candle to those in bound theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances neve campbell possessing an iron clad no nudity clause in her contract keeps her clothes more or less on the film greatest curiosity is full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower maybe few girls will skip seeing fully clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch glimpse of what kyra sedgwick mrs kevin bacon is familiar with the director of wild things is john mcnaughton whose last effort was the finely tuned psychological thriller normal life that movie featured copious sex pair of real characters and powerful script it difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker but suppose we all need to put food on the table mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here in what is obviously stab at mainstream success his previous wide release picture mad dog and glory was box office disappointment quick cuts and pretty sunrises can even begin to cover up this movie flaws the main character and use that term lightly since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality is sam lombardo matt dillon guidance counselor at florida mavi bay high school student the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan denise richards has crush on him one afternoon she comes to his house to wash his car and when she leaves her clothing is torn after confessing to her mother theresa russell that she was raped she goes to the police station where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette kevin bacon and gloria perez daphne rubin vega they are skeptical about here claims until another girl suzie toller neve campbell comes forward with similar tale meanwhile sam convinced that he being set up goes to shyster lawyer bill murray for help the acting in wild things isn very good but none of the principals have much to work with this is definitely not character based motion picture not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have triple digit but it doesn bother to give any of the on screen individuals even hint of depth the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice but nothing more matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps neve campbell gets to model the slutty look denise richards strikes fetching pose in see through one piece bathing suit and nothing in the film gets rise out of kevin bacon the only one who even remotely interesting is bill murray and he seems to think he in comedy not thriller maybe he got the right idea columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film ending which prompts the question which ending do they want kept secret wild things has no less than three one occurs during the end credits so stay seated all of which are jaw droppingly absurd feat that joe eszterhas the writer of basic instinct and showgirls would be impressed by thanks to jeffrey kimball polished kinetic cinematography wild things always looks great and george clinton score keeps it pulsing and throbbing but no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is this is still trash and like all garbage it stinks
like good action film should metro has action that keeps you involved some action films have action sequences that are so conventional our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts the ghost in the darkness which opened few months ago is film that action was so bland and uninvolving it not only invited my thoughts to divert me it nearly put me asleep but metro is one of the best action films in while it is hip sharp nifty and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy eddie murphy was in bad shape for while and this invites me to mention last year the nutty professor which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be metro happens to be lot better than any film in the beverly hills cop series that is because metro takes itself seriously but doesn prevent itself from having little fun eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible and controlled people the beverly hills cop movies all featured eddie as reckless wild cop always crossing the line by just an inch in metro he plays hostage negotiator so negotiation is his job not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble his character in metro takes himself seriously eddie murphy mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in metro and perhaps it is quite better off that way murphy plays scott roper and as previously mentioned he is san francisco hostage negotiator in the first tense situation in the film we are introduced to roper kind of work as he tries to calm down confused unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up murphy handles the scene seriously without his usual happy go lucky misfit humor the film develops when its villain is established and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda jewel thief and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim metro takes different twists and slight turns and there is one great virtuoso chase scene involving the cable car cars flip cars crash cars turn over and it is done so good in this film was reminded of speed and the speeding bus that couldn go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons there are also some other good scenes in metro that lot of films would rather choose not to have scenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner few little methods of betting and winning of course the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling the scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice too those are the scenes that make up metro which is mainly about eddie murphy maturing as personality the actor that most enjoyed seeing in metro was michael rapaport who plays roper new partner lip reading book skimming genius and master of observation it was not the actor presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of proclaimed genius rapaport is an actor who usually see in the role of the dimwit the really really dopey dimwit hardly recognized him in metro and it was quite joy to be able to see him in role like this feel that respect him more there are two main types of villains in movies like this the ones that are part of the story and the ones that are devices the villain in metro is no more than device but he is darn good villain nonetheless he is played by michael wincott whose voice is pushed out in abraded rasp as if he smokes cigarette between every take wincott makes his villain korda as mean as could be the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down flight of stairs just for kicks like richard widmark in kiss of death and in addition wincott physical appearance and mannerisms in the film actually reminded my of an arrogant friend use to have who is no longer on my good list liked metro and do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy his past roles were the great ones but they were also precursor to the maturing that would later take place possibly from murphy growing as person now having family metro is no nonsense movie it works as buddy movie which it does not overplay it works as dry comedy which it does not overplay it works as suspense film which it does not overplay and it works as an action film where it does have tendency to occasionally go all out but who cares it still remains serious and it does not overdo itself oh and there were plenty of explosions in metro as well how nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those if there is one major objection had to metro it was the length an area where lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes metro is film that lasted little too long but it was still entertaining and it gave me something to do while waited for it to end paul haynes
capsule dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes and now something of landmark for having spawned jillion clones basic instinct worst crime is that it not just bad movie but in many ways an incompetent one as well it stupid in itself and stupid to think its audience is as stupid as it is it supposed to be thriller but the plot is dead on its feet and ultimately arbitrary it only put into the movie to jerk us around it also supposed to be sexy but it instead got the unpleasant rawness of teenager showing younger kids his collections of dirty pictures it ripoff the story opens with rock star being murdered while in the throes of orgasm the biggest suspect is an authoress catherine tramell sharon stone who wrote novel in which the murder was eerily presaged or maybe it the work of copycat these and other plot threads get fed to the detective who on the case michael douglas who has few problems himself like we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor we can measure with stopwatch the time from them setting eyes on each other to the moment they are doing the mattress dance joe eszterhas has written the screenplay and he uses device that he used before in the much better jagged edge the killer identity is kept secret until the movie final shot this isn in itself problem the problem is that up until that point we ve been given nothing to work with every clue in the movie every clue is ambiguous the whole thriller aspect of the movie is shill red herrings dead plot threads violence and kinky sexuality litter the movie like potholes in manhattan streets they add up to zip because they re not happening to people we care about douglas character is foulmouthed and bitter and that it stone character has an iron on smile that never changes the rest are forgettable when we don even have the luxury of giving damn about anyone in the movie who cares what happens in it especially with an ending that is not only unsatisfying but in many ways inexplicable friend of mine once came up with rule of thumb about movie characters if no one in the movie behaves like anyone you know or would care to know just leave one of the nastier things about the movie is the way it treats lesbianism not as an integral part of someone life but as kind of kink something to thrill men with despair whenever encounter this kind of stupidity in mainstream entertainment are we still so culturally neanderthal that the only way to include something like that in big budget hollywood film is as hefnerism

dear god this is fantastically bad film regardless of what say about knock off you can grasp its awfulness from my words you have to see it and experience it for yourself here the kicker though suggest that you do so yes this is bad film easily one of the most incompetent films of the year but it has certain misguided charm that makes it unique kind of disaster to endure in fact enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time despite the dreadful acting and completely incomprehensible story don get me wrong not excusing knock off it reaches an unacceptable level of badness it so incoherent that wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon michael wong paul sorvino and of course jean claude van damme it does however have the entertaining presence of rob schneider and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark as watched it occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness now in retrospect it seems clear that it wasn but it still fascinating kind of mess don like writing plot descriptions it is by far the most boring part of writing review but in this case off the hook there is no way could write an accurate synopsis for knock off for the sake of comparison had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing paid closer attention to knock off and the only thing am able to say about it is that van damme plays dude named ray and is accused by the cia think of selling knock off products knock off products are of course products that look like name brand materials but are generic and cheap don know what any of this has to do with martial arts but there are lots of martial arts in the film ray is good at martial arts so when he has to beat up bad guys there no problem rob schneider plays his sidekick although had no idea who he really was by the end of the film lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once in fact every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do in that order knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense but what strange mess it is it was written by stephen de souza who also wrote die hard and 48 hours can this be the same man don see how unless of course huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time knock off seems to have an interesting premise as far as action films go but there no semblance here for instance van damme is introduced and then seconds later he running chariot race through the streets of hong kong why who knows what are the implications of this have no idea most action films abandon depth in favor of action and this is normally problem knock off however is the first film that would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut the acting is embarrassingly bad rochon in particular delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity sorvino in addition deserves better than this van damme is bad but he charming in that bad way and so can say that he hard to watch although rarely understood what he was saying the only exception is rob schneider who is actually quite funny lot of the time tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison they re all pointless gimmicks though such as shots of the inner workings of knock off running shoe but his action scenes are never boring one particular piece inside of fruit factory fruit factory is well choreographed lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy such as our heroes first encounter with the rochon character but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous hope he did for the alternative is frightening thought knock off has the feel of truly terrible exercise in camp mania if it were boring give it zero stars but it not boring it loud and excessive and completely incoherent it also funny even when it isn meaning to be funny bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn deserve to be fully lambasted recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness but can deny it zany useless charm oh know they re just action scenes looking desperately for real story but they re fun action scenes amongst crowd of laughably inane concepts it fun to admire the awfulness of film like this but that doesn excuse the fact that it is indeed awful
welcome to your oh so typical sequel it tries to be twice as big as it predecessor yet ends up twice as shallow shallow hmm now there an idea maybe if the ill fated cruise liner in this movie had struck shallow reef early on things may have turned out better the first thing that struck me and surprised me was that the camera work for the opening sequence anyway was terrible looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet very different to the original movie the characters well not many of the characters actually had characters but here rundown annie who was the highlight of the the original must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie why because something got to account for her losing that many iq points even though annie wasn exactly rocket scientist in speed here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against wall for instance after successfully using chainsaw to cut hole in door so that group of people can escape noxious gases she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people can get ut till she get the chainsaw out of their faces bang bang bang in point of fact sandra character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules who constantly has to be rescued jason patric all can say is bring back keanu keanu reeves might have the emotional range of tree stump but that one more tree stump than jason has don think he changed facial expressions all movie jason smile for the cameras now frown said frown oh you are bang bang bang wooden just doesn describe this guys performance but it ll have to do the bad guy ahh william dafoe there bright move how can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledged classic body of evidence yes that is sarcasm his wide eyed maniac of character doesn start out too bad but goes steadily downhill as the movie progresses in the end he degenerates to chasing annie around for hostage even though he already has the money and can escape bang bang though like to give this movie double thumbs down there were some nice sequences considering the movie cost over 100 million dollars you hope there be at least couple the real eye popper for me even though it was given away in the trailer bang bang was the sequence where the cruise liner sideswipes the oil tanker this looks terrific and was very surprised to hear that the cruise liner in it was completely computer generated wow don think ve ever seen cg model look so real before the sequence where jason patric in trying to disable the propellers from under the ship is also terrific and the only time during the entire movie where you get that feeling of speed this lack of speed problem affects many sequences such as the oil tanker part it was oh no we re going to hit the oil tanker 20 minutes later oh no we re going to hit the oil tanker 20 min you get the point this movie failed simply because it didn live up to it name there was very little feeling of speed in the original movie the lead characters had to make split second decisions to survive in this movie it felt more like well people we re gonna run into that there island in few hours think might stroll over to engineering and see if can turn off the engines passing the cafeteria on the way can get anybody anything the ending of this movie really is terrible even though it features what ve since found out is one of the most expensive sequences ever in movie it just doesn work at all the part where the liner crashes through the town looks very realistic but surprise surprise it just takes waaaaay too long it seemed to go for 15 minutes before the ship finally stopped one thing that struck me as extremely poor scriptiing was that as the ship crashes through the harbour and town around 25 people are killed by the ship and there only 15 or so people left on the ship so when it stops safe and sound and the characters are all cheering the audience is sitting back and thinking wait sec this is happy moment because bang bang then there was the dog almost fell out of my seat when saw the bit with the dog dodging the falling debris putting dog in peril has become the ultimate hollywood cliche every movie seems to have dog in danger sequence volcano dante peak independence day daylight twister lost world etc etc this movie is perfect example of how not to make sequel director jan de bont should try watching the orignal movie and this one back to back and see if he realises where he went wrong
synopsis the president of company wants to test his self appointed successor who psychotic and thinks it great idea to spend week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after heavy snowfall comments tracks of killer had couple of strikes against it before even began watching it strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotape sticker in siyah marker not typically good sign when you rent film strike two came while the previews played did you ever get sinking premonition about movie quality or lack thereof while watching the trailers that come before it well the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows and they all looked bad definately not good sign tracks of killer itself completed the strikeout about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery to be fair the first half hour or so promises at least watchable thriller wolf larson who bears more than passing resemblance to hugh grant adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the film title james brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten brolin character for some inexplicable reason thinks its great idea to spend some time in cabin practically isolated with lebrock and larson whom he decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company by the time the characters arrive at the cabin this film begins to become tedious apparently brolin successor test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing which don seem like attributes necessary to run business in the city but then again what do know about business do think though that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin its beds and closets have habit of just breaking at the slightest touch larson character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill this leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters which really isn enough to sustain it the film writer must have taken cue from stephen king as scenes from tracks of killer seem lifted out of misery and gerald game larson and lebrock fight and torture each other the tables get turned couple of times while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help some old guy around too just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film the old guy however miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in scene so ludicrous it worthy of chuckle or two outside of that chuckle unfortunately tracks of killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors for some reason become increasing obnoxious if you re in video store and thinking about renting this turkey don make tracks to far superior suspense film like misery
there should be requirement that potential viewer be under certain film iq in order to see mission to mars there are probably quite few people who are going to enjoy it and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind but there are those who will not and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies 2001 space odyssey armageddon apollo 13 the abyss close encounters of the third kind the extra terrestrial alien and aliens why because there is not one original idea in mission to mars all of it is cribbed from other films and in most cases better films if this is the sort of thing you don mind you might like the film of course there are other reasons not to like mission to mars the main one being script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven used their brains in some time and who don intend to start during the film running time mission to mars manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time the plot cribbed greatly from 2001 concerns team sent to mars the first manned trip ever made to the kirmizi planet luke graham don cheadle leads the team jointly formed of americans and russians the team encounters mysterious monolith that emits strange pulse this being nothing like the pulse emitting monolith in 2001 that one was on the moon but when they try to study it giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them all except luke who survives long enough to send garbled message back to the rotating space station which looks strangely like the rotating space station in 2001 rescue mission is planned with husband wife team woody blake tim robbins and terri fisher connie nielsen obligatory pilot with troubled past jim mcconnell gary sinise and extra crew member phil ohlmyer jerry connell along for the ride after some zero gravity dancing they run into problems when one of their engines is blown forcing them to attempt desperate landing aboard supply vessel now stranded on mars with minimal supplies the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home after all that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth mission to mars is one of those films that makes critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it so let start with one of the things that does work director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in few scenes during the middle of the film that it everything else fails the failure isn de palma fault he working from an atrocious script only during the sequence aboard the ship looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in 2001 where the rescue team air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does mission to mars come to life scene where they attempt to save comrade floating away into space also provides some tension until you realize that the entire danger more danger attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film it just contrived way to generate thrilling scenes take it out and the plot isn affected in any way the sequence also suffers from few plot holes as does the rest of the film why is the ship computer which sounds strangely like hal from uh 2001 able to detect hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine why did tim robbins character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside shouldn the astronauts be better trained to deal with hull breach why are the characters such idiots because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them all the conflict is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing long opening tracking shot during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know jim it too bad you can go on this mission because you were determined psychologically inadequate because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together does anyone really talk like this can we find out these things in less grating matter like maybe in flashback the whole film is like that the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what going on they must tell us exactly what we re looking at every time sample dialogue from the film shot of mars astronaut look there mars astronaut you sure that mars astronaut yeah that mars all right astronaut hey are you guys looking at mars that exchange isn actually in mission to mars but wouldn be surprised if it were for all their cribbing from kubrick spielberg james cameron and even ron howard the makers of this film haven learned to do something all those directors did very well show and don tell de palma used to know how but seems to have forgotten this is mentally challenged filmmaking they assume the audience won get what going on so they explain everything five times over fourth graders may appreciate this but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted the principal actors sleepwalk their way through mission to mars never managing to do away with an apparent just here to get paycheck attitude cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines armin mueller stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard decent guy performance and sinise hams it up with wistful facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife played by kim delaney who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in heavy handed monologue about the meaning of life and especially during the stolen from no less than three movies lollipop to whoever names them conclusion which combines endless obvious explanation and sub par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then and of course these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in 2001 who facilitated the evolution of life on earth those aliens were from an unknown world it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy mission to mars but such comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow going leisurely pacing might have helped film with little more substance to it but all of the substance of mission to mars has been stolen from other films and those other films dealt with their ideas in much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters supposedly we re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one totally different from the one character decides not to return ending of armageddon but suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning me alternated between the two there is only one good thing about the way mission to mars finally ends the fact that the movie is over
underwater science fiction stays submerged sphere film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman one of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in movie theater is when cast of fine actors end up in film that wastes their talents you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered psychologist norman goodman dustin hoffman is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of plane crash when he arrives at the site he discovers that there is no plane but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years having written paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship his group as outlined in his report consists of beth halperin sharon stone biochemist harry adams samuel jackson mathematician and ted fielding liev schreiber an astrophysicist unfortunately it turns out that the writing was blow off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then colleagues to the team after all he explains who reads government documents lead by harold barnes peter coyote top secret federal operative the group descends to mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel once there they stroll over knock on the door and explore the still operational ufo discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere when adams enters the sphere the weirdness unfolds storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer my name is jerry am happy flashes across the screen this is unsettling for the psychologist what happens if jerry gets mad he asks barnes is more pragmatic he needs last name because he can put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry then the situation turns bad deadly beasts appear from nowhere gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel lethal sea snakes attack goodman giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading 20 000 leagues under the sea the suspicious scientists turn against each other this has all the makings of first rate thinking man science fiction film however even the finest ingredients don go very far in the hands of chief who doesn seem to care about his product director barry levinson has churned out mish mosh that doesn engage the audience beyond few skillful suspense scenes the first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification it much like speed reading novel and realizing that you missed the nuances it doesn get any better when the action scenes begin while the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles the people are still flat oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them after adams experiences the interior of the sphere no one bothers to ask him what happened their history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited even goodman and halperin ill conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing her psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing there truism that items shown early in movie must be used before the ending but here they are far too obvious when an emergency mini sub is explained you know what going to happen the movie affectations are nothing more than distracting chapter headings that divide the movie have no function the shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos much of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow although some of the disorientation eventually is understandable great deal of it isn even science fiction film must be internally consistent there too much here that doesn make sense are the manifestations real the jellyfish kill queen latifa in throw away role and the squid nearly destroys the outpost but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect scene in the sub suggests that it illusion but earlier episodes indicate that it not not everything has to be explained to death but there are major questions that the film never answers where the ship came from is clarified but how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to even the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll the climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale after pre release audience testing the actors were called back to re shoot the ending it difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse following the recent tradition of lengthy films this weighs in at over two very long hours the weak scenes could have been cut but then there wouldn have been much left the movie was supposedly held up by effects work but there nothing special on the screen we never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm stealing from alien the abyss and the disastrous event horizon this film has learned nothing from them remarkably levinson and hoffman other currently showing film is wag the dog smart and entertaining piece of work this one could have been titled the same sans one word
renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean claude van damme on the action star 1997 pairing with dennis rodman _double_team_ and managed to make what initially appeared to be disaster into slick stylish and somewhat diverting action timekiller tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels _knock_off_ but this time around style neither save script that is at best ridiculous and at worst incomprehensible nor hide host of truly lousy performances writer steven desouza fairly straightforward plotline isn as outre as _double_team_ strange yarn involving secret think tank prison but it makes about as much sense which is little van damme plays marcus ray hong kong based sales rep for jeans company who stumbles upon russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip sized bombs in hk product exports to the dolls electronic equipment and yes jeans it all part of some type of ransom scheme but all remember is and kid you not graphics on cia computer screen showing map of the world bombs detonating and an hat wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter which is what the crowd at the showing attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ while all of van damme films have its share of unintentional laughs mostly due to the stiff acting skills of the physically agile van damme _knock_off_ delivers more than usual though not as many as van damme embarrassing directorial effort 1996 _the_quest_ lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza smoked that badass like roman candle and entrepreneurship babycakes standing out among my favorites but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_ laughs van damme is true to laughable form perhaps even worse than usual early scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co star rob schneider improbably cast as deep cover cia agent posing as marcus business partner and the sight and sound of the still heavily accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider cia superior and lela rochon playing an investigator for the jeans company spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode in rochon defense though her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs exquisite bone structure and perky bosoms the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage tsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_ juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work here though tsui visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise for each nifty trick tsui pulls off such as recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices there are others that are completely superfluous this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context for instance one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in box as he puts his hand in the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in rectangle at the corner of the screen it undoubtedly an interesting visual but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something the test of van damme movie boils down to the action sequences but surprisingly those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired tsui does what he can to make something of them employing freeze frames blurred motion and unconventional camera angles but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza there isn anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger land mine fight in _double_team_ let alone anything remotely close to tsui legendary hong kong works but that given going in if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo stateside success he would do best to break free from van damme before it too late if he continues his involvement with grade movies such as _knock_off_ the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish that is if it hasn already disappeared entirely after this fiasco
upon first viewing of this movie the phrases been there and done that come quickly to mind spy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films the most popular of which are airplane and the naked gun series stealing stuff can be profitable in this industry but only when you steal the right stuff what little plot there is involves dick steele aka agent wd 40 leslie nielsen trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy griffith along the way to it goal goal the film manages to spoof mainly the james bond type films but also manages to hit on films such as home alone and sister act the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny or at the least satirical spy hard achieves neither as it borrows all of the wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films the dick the world is in danger what is it well it big roundish ball floating in space around the sun paraphrasing type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film each time getting progressively less funny what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brother films while writing their own dialogue director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors especially nielsen who can do this quite well than on the delivery and context of their lines much of the time cutting the punchline short the whole film seems to be in race with itself to be over as is evident in the final sequence where there is no comedic denouement after the climax as was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context one of the more amusing was captain of the enterprise james kirk overall thought this was very weak effort while all of the right films to spoof were chosen they used none of the right spoofing methods next time they should spy little bit harder excellent one of kind must see entertaining worth the price of admission fair nothing much special what were they thinking
first impressions critically close to awful film but money wise it has been doing and will continue to do great sometimes funny film that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring an orginal plot that grows old real fast one of the only 90 minute films that ve gotten bored through men in siyah has defied the odds when first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long thought maybe that this was poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas however now realize that not only did men in siyah run out of gas but the film in 90 minutes manages to show off very original idea which summer audiences have embraced that becomes old about 25 minutes into the movie tommy lee jones and will smith play two government agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society the ridiculous plot begins when an alien bug played weirdly by vincent onofrio who was so great in full metal jacket lands on earth to retrieve galaxy that somewhere on orion belt anyway the basic plot revolves around jones and smith to stop this bug from getting the galaxy or higher power will blow up the earth the premise is ridulous but that is not why didn like this film love original plots this one had an original one but director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films whenever saw onofrio bug stomp and eat people in the film it got terribly boring after while while smith wise cracks did fill in the gaps it wasn enough and also cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have sub plot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent they can have contact with any humans really and here see jones at satellite computer watching his lover plant the garden sentimental moment in an alien movie nice try but don think so it doesn work here it just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring we don only have aliens to worry about but now we have jones conscience came into the movie not wanting to see jones conscience but wanting to see real action movie that had lots of aliens in it maybe it unfair that partly judged this movie on what my expectations were nevertheless even though some parts are indeed funny the plot in this movie grew old and boring quick
there are movies that pose question in its first five minutes and spend the rest of the time trying to answer it then there are movies that spend the whole time posing questions and try to answer it all in the last five minutes writer director john herzfeld two days in the valley falls into the latter category weaving together grabbag of seemingly unrelated characters herzfeld tries very hard to keep the audience guessing with altmanesque series of parallel stories hitmen lee james spader and his partner dosmo danny aiello pop guy in bed while leaving his drugged wife becky fox teri hatcher lying next to him showing the audience where on her behind she got nicely pricked an understandeably shocked becky runs out of the house the next morning before hailing down couple of vice cops jeff daniels and wes eric stoltz murder is not vice territory flirting with asian prostitues is but wes would rather play inquisitive detective meanwhile washed up director teddy paul mazursky is about to end his life but before he can do that he must find good home for his dog enter nurse audrey marsha mason who takes the dog and teddy for ride stuffy art dealer allan hopper greg cruttwell has kidney stones while struggling about his fancy house he switches between moaning in self pity and dropping condescending hints about his loyal secretary glenne headly plain appearance don be surprised if you find yourself asking more than once just what the hell is going on you might like that feeling of cluelessness herzfeld does answer all the questions in the course of time and pieces it all rather neatly in the last five minutes the jigsaw puzzle assembled isn stunning by any means though the characters lack the stature or moral complexity of altman real life heroes in short cuts even though they are interesting and funny funny that is if you aren comparing them to the likes of tarantino pulp chcaracters the tie up is tidy but nowhere near the squeaky clean resolution of director name guy who also did last seduction kirmizi rock west two days isn bad movie but there isn much else to it than the screenplay novelty of the linkage of seemingly unrelated characters it ll keep you guessing alright but you won remember the answers five minutes after the credits the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
warning may contain slight mild spoilers rated for intense violence gore some strong sexuality and language starring arnold schwarzeneggar robin tunney rod stieger gabriel byrne running time 132 minutes we go into movie theater boom the lights go down our hearts race we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie we ve been waiting to see for long time comes on we sit there watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is why shouldn have know what was getting myself into again like this past summers hit stigmata end of days may be worse it not like this is any kind of original idea it just throws in some rosemary baby along with the devil advocate little exorcist and some stigmata here and there whala you have end of days movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific sadly but truly again like most recent films all the good parts are in the trailers the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be hit in the first weekend and flop in the next jericho cane arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role is cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan living in gabriel byrnes body and stop him from impregnating christine york robin tunney because if he does and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist he has to do this before it turns into the year 2000 and strangely he trying to fight him minutes before 2000 comes he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger in terrific role and tries to save this girl leading to an ending that satisfying but turns into typical action movie that pretty much it on plot it does have the razzle and dazzle of great action movie and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it parts you have to wonder where all the money went as for arnie good role ok performance think since he is getting little older he is held back lot of his stunts the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film in the trailers it looks like good scary action film and ends up being boring long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions gabriel byrnes who ironically played priest in stigmata here plays satan and gives good performance but again seems held back and not into his character two years back al pacino gave terrific performance in the fun the devil advocate and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also robin tunney great performance as always plays satan main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isn nothing new the direction by peter hyams is at times bit overblown though not nearly as the visual style was in stigmata here we are given great camera work and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just don work in this movie the script written by andrew marlowe has few witty lines but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax was ready to go home only few things work here and those are few of the performances the writing and visual style but the storyline and the finished product don work as well the sad thing is that end of days had so many things going for it the plot could have been more organized the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mind numbing at times it seems like armageddon and started to get old and tiresome hollywood is running out of ideas bad and like ve always said before needs new ones even with its 100m budget end of days is less than pleasing in fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over and easily could have had 70m budget maybe sound crazy but am really looking forward to the new exorcist film and hope that they make it as good as the original we need to get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just to make money at the box office we need to get more films like the blair witch project that could scare people to death while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them and how do know that it is in fact the blair witch overblown effects stupid and thin plot line good performances disappointing umm yup those pretty much describe end of days
my name is jack carter and you don want to know me says our brooding anti hero sylvester stallone take his advice to know this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over terrace and to watch this film is almost as painful get carter is gloomy looking unimaginative film that offers no joy jack carter is as tough as tough guys come he works out of vegas as self described financial adjuster explaining his duties he says people make promises and break them help them remember he has chiseled body full of tattoos he has the weathered look indicative of man who has seen his share of hard times he speaks in hushed but menacing tone of voice in other words this is sylvester stallone acting like sylvester stallone and like most of his previous roles his character is shallow one dimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk tough hassle few hapless people find out what he needs to know and then dispense his own kind of justice with the charisma of pit bull being tough is all that jack carter knows yet even tough guys know when to put family first as the story begins we learn that jack little brother has died in car accident the police attribute it to heavy drinking however jack is suspicious believing that he was taken out he takes break from his vegas duties and tries to see if he can find the truth as he pokes around he runs into several lowlife characters they include shady business partner prostitute dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates and an oily owner of porn website any one of them may know something about his brother death all of them have the means of carrying out the deed but don expect an exercise in sleuthing where well placed clues lead carter to the truth he all brawn and no brains so there are no epiphanies during his investigation instead he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward cycling through this circle of suspects flustered with his lack of progress he cycles through them again and again this all gets tiring fairly quickly by the time the film launches into its final act we re numb from its pedestrian pace oddly as tough guy thriller it starves us for action admittedly there is one nifty chase sequence but this is related to tangential and needless plot carter vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him the story also fails to generate any kind of emotion stallone has the personality of slab of stone and the look and feel of the film is perpetually downcast the weather is constantly overcast or rainy meanwhile most shots take place at night in dimly lit rooms or in dark alleys it just impossible to get stirred about that kind of atmosphere as result get carter amounts to nothing more than flat thriller bereft of clever moments and devoid of any excitement you re better off leaving this guy alone
you would think that this film dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of brilliant british comedy and americanizing it you be wrong since full blame can be placed on the very folks who wrote and created the series rowan atkinson robin driscoll and richard curtis should you ever happen to meet those chaps do me favor grab them by the hair and yell really loudly in their ear what were you thinking have you ever heard the phrase if it ain broke don fix it then walk away the film concerns mr bean atkinson and his visit to america while escorting the painting of whistler mother to an american buyer played by burt reynolds in the type of bit part that his success in boogie nights should hopefully do away with now how or why mr bean is sent on this trip makes no sense and can even describe how the film explains it the point is that mr bean comes to america and causes wacky trouble problems problems problems where to begin first the score music from the tv show has been completely replaced by score that is either at times one note away from the score from beetlejuice or one note away from the score from rob roy then the song choices are totally uninspired good vibrations love wow don put any thought into that guys also bean makes way too much noise in the film the character doesn speak much but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience and maybe the occasional murmur from mr bean each episode was like chaplin silent movie in the film bean is constantly moaning grunting whining etc it annoying and just plain wrong for the character the main problem though is that it just not funny with each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than 30 minutes multiply that running time by three however and the laughs steadily decrease they even have the gaul to repeat jokes from the series sad and creatively lazy as series mr bean only ran for about 13 episodes or so why on earth did atkinson and the gang decide it was time to completely rework everything 13 half hour episodes certainly hadn exhausted all possible situations all can say positively for the film at this point is that it almost appropriate for all ages if it wasn for couple of scenes where it appears as though mr bean is having sex with things and even that isn very positive statement please guys go back to england and go back to television so you ll make me laugh again [pg 13]
robin williams has the rarest of gifts the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style overwhelmingly his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best with the notable exception of flubber so when the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams tell you that not even williams can save his latest project you know it in trouble jakob the liar is confused muddled little movie generically uplifting film with fundamental contradiction the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn realize it williams plays jakob haim jew imprisoned in polish ghetto during world war ii one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of high ranking german officer for his punishment jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of radio broadcast the announcement in english but punctuated by triumphant heil hitler is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob ghetto liberation he thinks the next day jakob tells the news to his closest friend volatile prize fighter named misha liev schreiber who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along soon it is common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has radio hidden in his home crime punishable by death this is absurdly false but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate the danger of course is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger in curiously irrelevant subplot jakob finds 11 year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered and goes to great length to make sure of that just why the idea frightens him is never made clear he and the girl build an uninvolving generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren met the results are far worse than if there was no hope that the film biggest detriment it is based on false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false it never moving because it doesn give us anything to be moved by jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing robin williams doesn inject the film with life as matter of fact he seems little out of it as if crippled by his fake accent he is stragely unenthusiastic his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless hopeless not since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent this isn the robin williams we know and love in good will hunting he became serious actor and won an oscar for it here he is more of wannabe serious actor an impostor jakob the liar will be compared with last year life is beautiful because it is being marketed as holocaust comedy it not comedy it tries sometimes but it rarely works is it melodrama war movie character study no no and no jakob the liar is the kind of movie that can be placed into category not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts
it should have been classic great cast of respected supporting actors an interesting premise of loser comic book characters however mystery men proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999 the jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals the number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having fast paced premise the script tried to deliver series of small jokes throughout the film but without big laugh out loud joke and mediocre small jokes it failed miserably at being entertaining at all the jokes were not funny for number of reasons they had been used number of times before in previous films the best ones which were mediocre to begin with were ruined in the trailer and the expectation of laughing at clever unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film mystery men might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business but with veterans doing this kind of junk it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought thankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie the film follows band of wannabe superheroes living in wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy the fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has successful superhero captain amazing who has recently captured every evil doer in the city captain amazing played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear because of his success in the past is worried that he will lose popularity after freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city geoffrey rush overacting just bit too much to keep himself busy things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured it is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day by the time this section of the plot is finished the interest for what happens if you haven already figured it out is very low there are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention the first scene in the film which shows the wannabes trying to save the day feels like it was seriously edited down right when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folk home by some masked goons captain amazing comes in and saves the day or ruins the movie instead of editing this scene more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr furious ben stiller and monica waitress claire forlani or the vast majority of the film which is the heroes talking at coffee table about how their day was simple rule more silly action is needed in order to make silly action movie work another major problem with mystery men is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances the film depended on its cast to work fluently together like bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion however most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way to pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of hat paul reubens who disappeared from acting to everyone joy returns here leaving very little to be impressed about as wannabe who uses flatulence for weapon all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes fart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of american pie and there something about mary mystery men drags on towards the end to point where anything else in the world is more entertaining anyone with brain knows each one of the heroes is going to be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going to contribute in helpful way so why continue to watch this film is far from worthy guilty pleasure mystery men indeed does this and every time character succeeds another one congratulates him and says knew you could do it mystery men fails in every category it attempts to pass what makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable terrible acting terrible script and terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors unpredictable an overexcited ben stiller shouts out no ben you re the complete opposite
in my review of the spy who shagged me postulated an unbreakable law of film physics every time sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series it is followed by third movie that is bore the cause is probably complacency studio sighs with relief when part lives up to expectations and figures part is sure thing scream provides the latest proof of this rule in los angeles production has begun on stab return to woodsboro the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott neve campbell however life soon starts imitating art and stab cast members turn up stabbed smelling yet another book deal gale weathers courteney cox arquette comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex boyfriend dewey riley david arquette acting as technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer parker posey the actress playing gale in stab elsewhere our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name until she gets phone call from familiar evil voice the late randy meeks jamie kennedy makes surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of trilogy he notes the third chapter in trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and huge backstory to contend with indeed scream tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all the murder of sidney mother maureen before the beginning of the original scream at the scene of each murder in scream the killer leaves photo of sidney mother maureen as teenager in hollywood and even includes note claiming to be her real killer to find out who the killer is our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen missing years when she was starlet appearing in low budget horror films even with that little information you can probably already guess what the killer relationship to sidney is unlike its predecessors scream doesn have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped so that by the end we don even care who the killer is the jaded detective patrick dempsey the kinky producer lance henriksen the driven young director scott foley the ingenue emily mortimer the character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one secret so it quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen the series trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious possibly it the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson who penned the first two or maybe it that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes cliche groaned as an attack on sidney from the first scream was repeated moment for moment in the hollywood set of her home at some point referencing becomes just means to cover up poverty of new ideas scream also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles look for jenny mccarthy carrie fisher patrick warburton puddy from seinfeld roger corman and jason mewes and kevin smith as jay and silent bob to walk through at some point all these bit players put forth more effort than the series returning stars who are probably saving their energy for the long post scream job search another prediction made in previous review has come to pass more movies are copying the blair witch project web strategy scream has three official websites that wink wink pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie the sunrise studios site scream3 com has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the latest stab news there also gail weathers official site galeweathers com and sunrise sucks site that has more stab scandals the studio wants to cover up sunrisesucks com craven and company promise that this is the last installment in the scream series while hope that true don hold out much hope horror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters there halloween h2k in the works even though michael myers was beheaded in h20 and freddy vs jason has been talked about for awhile despite the fact that both characters were killed off there bound to be scream someday even if it starts over with new set of movie star wannabes bottom line they should have called this one yawn
want to be involved in show business one day and refuse to do any sequels to any movie may make because believe they only get worse this movie proves it for me was little worried about the last batman film as thought joel schumaccer taking over from tim burton would screw it up also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne they didn kilmer did good job and the cast was left to carry the movie which they did even jim carrey as the riddler and can stand jim carrey because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles this film is different the cast is still impressive but here not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction he one of those directors who good with actors terrible with camera angles but writer akiva goldsmith doesn really give an impressive cast anything to do the cast is impressive clooney is surprisingly good wayne batman donnell is crafty robin as usual they could ve casted somebody better as batgirl my friend likes neve campbell but silverstone is not bad and thurman is good poison ivy the major problem is schwarzenegger who is terrible freeze his accent is so heavy you can understand what he says and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act and they know it but they figure that if they flex their muscles say limited amount of stuff and kill bunch of guys then they figure nobody ll notice that the trouble with me notice schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney or as much money as he got for this but hollywood thinks he does patrick stewart was the person heard that was considered to play freeze and he would ve been so much better or sean connery but not arnold not an actor but play one in real life schwarzenegger realize that you must be star to play major role in batman film but it would ve been nice if they casted star that had talent for the role akiva goldsmith screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in normal batman film in regular batman film they concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend little more but elle macpherson julie madison is so limited here that we never get real sense of who she is there is talk of fifth batman movie my interest to see it is low but hope it better than this if you don want to waste your time rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster any other
for movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones it is surprising to find the messenger the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess in the early to mid 1400 there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of man or woman the church was dismally dark and oppressive place france was involved in the hundred years war against england there was no strong political leadership in the country morale was low there being little hope for the future it was within this setting that young french girl began hearing voices and seeing visions convinced that these were messages from god she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him the message if he would give her an army to command she would deliver to him the crown he does and she does then once seated on the throne he abandons her to her english captors director luc besson the fifth element may have co wrote the script but he never appeared to have proper handle on the material the inconsistencies of the cast the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes the inappropriate musical score and the lack of vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable his biggest miscue was to cast his wife milla jovovich the fifth element in the title role ms jovovich looks spectacular as joan clad in battle armor astride similarly protected horse if looks were enough to fully convey character she would have been brilliant since it isn she tried and failed to act the part her joan is unbalanced inspiring the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her banner or sword over her head like woman possessed john malkovich being john malkovich fares bit better as the dauphin who joan would see on the throne as charles vii an easily manipulated man his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death faye dunaway the thomas crown affair gives strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphin mother in law and chief advisor the army under joan command are comprised of comical figures more stooges than soldiers the one exception would be tcheky karyo la femme nikita as dunois the man who was leading the attack prior to joan arrival trying to plan systematic campaign he sees his leadership authority negated by joan insistence on following her visions dustin hoffman sphere has small inhuman role as joan conscience which begins speaking to her while awaiting trial dressed like cloaked monk he leads her to doubt herself and her revelations as well she should scriptures do speak of revelation god via his gift of holy spirit is able to communicate to men three of the nine manifestations of holy spirit listed in corinthians 12 deal with receiving revelation they are word of knowledge word of wisdom and discerning of spirits even the scriptures themselves are result of god giving revelation to his holy men who spake as they were moved by holy spirit by revelation but the scriptures also caution us beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world john [kjv] joan end being burned at the stake at the age of 19 the frenzy mob rule and blood lust her inspiration wrought and the death pain or suffering which followed her campaign all point to devilish influence rather than godly one while her conviction and intense believing remains an admirable quality she was as others have been before and since misled by the spiritual master of deception as messenger she was quite effective she was just confused as to whose message she was carrying
possibly the years the most anticipated film and finally it arrives here in the uk it smashed box office office records in it opening weekend and will no doubt do the same here but is it any good in word no ll elaborate further the story is as follows apparently there were two islands with dinosaurs on one where the dinos lived untouched by mankind and the other tourist attraction which failed before it even opened see jurrasic park imgen the company that funded jurrasic park want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island and move them to new attraction in san diago realizing what bad idea this is proffessor john hammond richard attenborough decides to send team to document the dinosaurs so as to rally public support to preserve the island enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there so basically what you have is this two teams one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other trying to document them being forced to work together fighting for survival against the dinosaurs firm intentions on eating them fairly good idea however it let down by one slight problem it crap over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring way too quiclky add to this terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation and you end up very disinterested it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like what for tea and should you cut the lawn later yes you should it shame then really that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is blatant cash in which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park with only few creative and genuinely tense scenes and fabulous dinosaurs the rex have to be seen to be believed there is nothing else to recommend the lost world very dissapointing sequel indeed
holy man boasts sweet gentle comic performance from an unusually subdued eddie murphy and few moderately funny skits unfortunately to get to the good stuff you have to sit through painfully long set up loads of tedious filler interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering and twitching superfluous romantic subplot and quite possibly the most annoying performance of robert loggia career if ever movie screamed wait for video so you can fast forward through all the dull and annoying parts this is it eddie murphy plays robed nomadic pilgrim wandering the land enjoying the moment and spreading his spiritual message chance meeting with ricky hayman goldblum stressed out executive of home shopping channel and kate newell kelly preston no nonsense media analyst results in physical injury to quicker than you can say the odd couple ends up rooming with an extremely leery ricky after some script gymnastics appears live on the air at the good buy shopping network wreaking havoc on the cheesy product demonstrations enraging network owner mr mcbainbridge loggia and becoming national media sensation holy man attempts to be several things at once it tries to satirize home shopping networks but it difficult to effectively make fun of something that is already self parody the film attempts to teach us that collecting material possessions is merely futile attempt to fill the spiritual holes in our hearts but that common knowledge already holy man also tries to present story of redemption as ricky hayman tries to decide whether to exploit good will to achieve financial security or do the right thing at the expense of his career anyone want to place wager on his final decision the one genuine asset in holy man is eddie murphy who gives charming performance sharing love good will and relevant advice to all those around him while beaming his million dollar smile at just the right moments murphy is delightful and the film takes off whenever he onscreen unfortunately he not onscreen enough jeff goldblum gets the lion share of screen time and his tired storyline weighs the proceedings down as his potential love interest kelly preston tries to brighten things up but she transforms from an all business media shark to an empathic softy far too quickly and the abrupt change reeks of contrivance the other principal actor robert loggia wastes his talents in one note turn as ruthless screaming monster structurally unsound and way too long holy man is appealing when murphy is onscreen and dull when he isn instead of dropping your money at the theater for this trifle wait until it hits video and fast forward past everything except the murphy scenes suggests that we focus on enjoying the moment and that the best way to do so
it actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode the phantom menace because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy and no really don feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the box office really don not at all the plot has been done before mysterious unaddressed love letter shows up in small town causing confusion for everyone who reads it the center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen kate capshaw and by the way what is it with bookstore owner main characters in the past year and half we ve seen them in life is beautiful you ve got mail this movie and the upcoming notting hill who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore she immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from and comes to the incorrect conclusion that the author of the note is young employee played by tom everett scott he reading the letter himself assumes that she wrote it for him after while they fall in love well duh kate feels guilty about getting in relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman tom selleck to add to her turmoil her mother shows up blythe danner who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about and her trusted bookstore manager deadpan ellen degeneres quits supporting characters aren called supporting for nothing their purpose isn just to move the plot along they re also supposed to give the storyline backbone to do this they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting rarely can movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed dull cardboard secondary characters especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonist various interactions with them this is the love letter damning error capshaw character is as good as have seen present in recent romantic comedies but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely one dimensional because of that the love letter is awkward and insincere even worse it bore liked capshaw and her helen but everyone else is painfully fake undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist there is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either and besides degeneres wisecracks there little that is even little amusing this is not completely thoughtless film and director peter ho sun chan does good job of portraying helen yearnings and various subtle complexities but it far from profound there isn common theme running through the proceedings thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless really this is harmless little movie it far from an abomination and it not torturous to sit through but bad it is awful it also is the love letter is failure and an inane failure at that 1999 eugene novikov&#137
surrounded by hype high hopes and the promise of an over the top performance by clueless brittany murphy don say word looked full of promise hell when hear that ll never tell whisper on the tv commercial goose bumps run up my spine alas word is filled with little but disappointment kooky mix of girl interrupted and ransom with michael douglas and company collecting paycheck to plod through vapid and dull kidnapping thriller douglas stars as nathan conrad renowned new york psychologist devoted father of jessie conrad skye mccole bartusiak and loving husband to aggie conrad famke janssen after gang of jewel thieves headed by sean bean koster kidnaps his daughter nathan is forced to extract from his new patient the catatonic and violent elisabeth burrows murphy the location of some hidden bank job booty that her father hid from the koster gang decade ago but with hard nosed detective sandra cassidy jennifer esposito doing her best lo impression tracking down koster and his gang of hoodlums the stakes are raised as nathan races against the clock to crack the mystery of elisabeth head in order to get the goods inside the catch nathan only has until five clock to solve the puzzle whoa the suspense is almost too much don say word loses the audience inside of 15 minutes murphy looks and acts like linda blair from the exorcist during the first part of the movie then turns around and reprises like her role from girl interrupted and the only real crazy to be found in the film is director gary fleder things to do in denver when you re dead staggering use of flashback sequences oliver platt famke janssen and even sean bean are decent actors but the stuff they are given here such as bedridden wife fighting off the token siyah guy with her crutch is insulting and demeaning additionally the use of the surveillance cameras and laptops to track nathan every move is downright unbelievable how do ex cons fresh out of the big house afford all this equipment despite its flaws don say word is surprisingly some of the best mainstream film you ll find this month and audiences will lap it up americans love lukewarm half baked thrillers starring big names and accompanied by cheap thrills someone get me my lithium
some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning live action version of mr magoo being prime example the cartoon figure mr magoo the bumbling blind man can be quite funny but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls you are right but there is an even more astonishing selection for director they tapped hong kong stanley tong whose resume consists mainly of handful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan the story such that there is one is about large stolen ruby which looks woolworth reject mr magoo gets it and of course does not realize he has it mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased like home alone but without any class mr magoo can only be described as painfully bad fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity the movie humor is pathetically lame and the pacing is way off when one is stuck in theater for an hour and half watching what claims to be motion picture one looks for some solace mr magoo provides only three such moments the movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character who exudes his usual charm the only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus the sweet little bulldog angus demonstrates more genuine emotions and wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture finally the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked rather than attempt to adapt mr magoo to non cartoon movie nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be human version of the cartoon he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie but was not so lucky hopefully this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not mr magoo runs 37 it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages my son jeffrey age said he thought the movie was good and really funny but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie he said he liked home alone much more his friend maxim age said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense his other friend nickolas age said he give the movie but that it was really silly
breakdown is an moderately entertaining if underwhelming thriller kurt russell and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff and amy taylor taking the scenic route to california through redneck country however while in the middle of nowhere their jeep decides to break down leaving them stranded friendly truck driver warren walsh offers to give them lift to town although jeff rejects the offer he wants to stay with his car amy agrees hops into warren lorry and promptly disappears jeff wonders where the hell she is and when he later catches up with warren and warren says he has never seen amy in his life the plot thickens and jeff goes on chase to find his wife although comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance 1972 and the vanishing 1993 plot wise the latter two are far superior character and script wise kurt russell is as jeff although he can seemingly only pull of one expression which is angry throughout the whole film he looks angry or just pissed off quinlan is again but again she can only pull off one expression which is looking dorky throughout the whole film she looks dorky walsh who sadly recently passed away is fine as warren who we soon find out is kidnapper although his actual character is pretty weak and not really menacing enough the supporting cast do their best aswell with rex linn as doubting sheriff and the other kidnappers the story written by first timer jonathan mostow who also directs is if surprisingly familiar and sometimes extraordinarily stupid some of the things the characters do in this movie is beyond the bounds of idiocy there are some flaws with the plot also as the characters do the complete opposite to logical presumably to keep the story exciting and also the fact that the story just isn strong enough to sustain the audience attention the picture moves along very slowly also it almost threatens to drop dead the picture does pick up towards the end but by then it too late mostow directs the action sequences well enough however the film doesn really come to satisfying conclusion either the ending tries to be bleak but just comes off annoying breakdown could of been far more enjoyable picture had it had stronger cast and director instead it just turns out to be merely average missed opportunity overall rating= review by david wilcock
ugh that about sums this movie up just ugh the original godzilla movies are somewhat of cult classic and when reviewing the previous films each film had certain degree of intelligence and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following in spite of bad special effects horrible dubbing and man in lizard suit they maintained certain degree of how to put this dignity not quite the word looking for you understand right and in 50 years godzilla has maintained that degree of whatever leave it to america to screw the whole thing up >from the geniuses that brought us independece day arguably the worst sci fi movie of all time to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had while they do bring us eye popping special effects that will amaze you they lost what was at the center of all the original godzilla movies storyline summing up the movie is simple heck can do it in one sentence giant lizard attacks giant city and bunch of nobodies stop it simple as that matthew broderick stumbles over his lines and it hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dog walking character on the television show mad about you the dialogue seems to be improvized almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all can see the scene on the set right now all right we spent all of this money making big special effects and we ve gotta get this movie out by summer or it going to bomb in our faces so you actors just say what ever comes to the top of your head all right make up something kay good roll film the special effects are enough to keep you interested through one viewing and some of the cinemtography is well done the scene with the siyah umbrellas comes to mind still an hour into it you will become antsy wondering how long they can drag it out and drag it out they do have to laugh the slogan for the film is size does matter think they cut this too short it should read size does matter acting does not
ripe with explosions mass death and really weird hairdos tsui hark double team must be the result of tipsy hollywood power lunch that decided jean claude van damme needs another notch on his bad movie bedpost and nba superstar dennis rodman should have an acting career actually in double team neither performance is all that bad ve always been the one critic to defend van damme he possesses high charisma level that some genre stars namely steven seagal never aim for it just that he never made movie so exuberantly witty since 1994 timecop and rodman well he pretty much rodman he extremely colorful and therefore he pretty much fits his role to even if the role is that of an ex cia weapons expert it the story that needs some major work van damme plays counter terrorist operative jack quinn who teams up with arms dealer yaz rodman to rub out deadly gangster stavros mickey rourke all beefy and weird looking in an antwerp amusement park the job is botched when stavros son gets killed in the gunfire and quinn is taken off to an island known as the colony think tank for soldiers too valuable to kill but too dangerous to set free quinn escapes and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife natacha lindinger but stavros is out for revenge and kidnaps her so what kickboxing mercenary to do quinn looks up yaz and the two travel to rome so they can rescue the woman kill stavros save the world and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do with crazy often eye popping camera work by peter pau and rodman lite brite locks double team should be mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure but too much tries to happen in each frame and the result is movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated the numerous action scenes are loud and headache inducing and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about what going on in the movie and much of what going on is just wacky there whole segment devoted to net surfing monks that have yet to figure out and the climax finds quinn going head to head with tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on motorcycle trying to avoid running over land mines and hold on to quinn baby boy who in bomb equipped basket all this while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers did mention double team is strange when it all comes down this is just another rarely entertaining formula killathon albeit one that feels no need to indulge in gratuitous profanity rodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona though leading up to stunt where he kicks an opponent between the legs but we didn need double team to tell us he could do that did we
synopsis man whose lover paris was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system the subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend laura and becomes addicted to virtual reality which due to design flaw in his unit recreates the dead paris comments virtual seduction executive produced by roger corman and lance robbins serves as cheaply made precursor to strange days far superior film both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are ab using technology to be with former lovers in strange days the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality interestingly both films also take place couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium though strange days uses the setting far more effectively this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction it not bad for what it is low budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality unfortunately it been done before and since in much better films fact which ultimately leaves the sci fi fan bored by this movie virtual seduction has many faults one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins the film script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavy handed and wooden as the movie progresses many important scenes seem too dark the lighting could have been improved significantly the cast collection of veteran movie actors and sitcom regulars do only mediocre job in their roles jeff fahey of the original lawnmower man convincingly though unenergetically plays the lead character carrie genzel plays paris the vr lover but ami dolenz as the current love interest seems like much more interesting and attractive character with caring personality which doesn lend credence to the film premise meschach taylor of the once popular designing women sitcom adequately plays scientist working on the project but his performance isn something to write home about either virtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background in other words one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then but it rather boring to just sit and watch the movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from movies in this genre but it is still an adult rated film due to sexual situations and suicide attempt this turkey ultimately isn awful but it not particularly interesting or unique either don be seduced into watching this movie unless you ve got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch
yeah yeah the advertisements didn even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook sex neve campbell and starship trooper denise richards getting it on ok yeah it decent two minutes of film erotica but even if that your main interest in this film there plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes wild things does have lot more to think about than you might expect however nearly every single scene is huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing or at least curious to see the next turn throughout the entire movie but this fast paced razor sharp turning of events doesn leave much time to enjoy the surprises we start off in high class california high school where every student resembles supermodel in the making guidance counselor sam lombardo matt dillon seems to catch the eye of every student particularly kelly van ryan richards daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts right off the bat kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce mr lombardo the fund raiser car wash seems the opportune time particularly when you wash your guidance counselor jeep in all beyaz clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you ll be soaked from head to toe when you re done on the weekend of the car wash kelly attempts at seduction fall flat and when they do she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day naturally sam is thrown into state of panicked shock at these accusations but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to criminal trial when low class marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller campbell comes forth with near identical story also involving her trusted guidance counselor pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney ken bowden played by bill murray yes that bill murray sound like good complete movie yes that alone could have been but this is just the beginning in fact the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time by the time the movie finishes you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable unfortunately with so much going on you re not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when new twist comes about this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could ve been the 113 minutes fly by and although it never feels underdeveloped this pretzel of storytelling could ve been much more richly realized had slower pace been taken the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime time soap operas which no is not good thing and it not just campbell who happens to hail from the prime time fox soap party of five but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones dillon who was so charming in his understated role in last year in out gives the best performance and murray surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film in fact if the whole movie had been promoted as subtle comedy even if it was the exact same film would actually give it better grade that how cheezy it comes off but aside from these two the rest offer nothing more than some good eye full in the right hands wild things could ve been wickedly delightful scrumptiously twisted thriller but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting and what up with these people passing as high school students realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles but when realized it wasn supposed to be college they were at had to snicker won lie this is definitely guilty pleasure as corny as it is it got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least for effort but if you just want to admire denise richards go for last year starship troopers which was every bit as campy but million times better of course if seeing her breasts is your most important goal you ll be right at home with wild things perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters
was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of kirmizi corner and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws but if you ask me the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for fellow american or more the point anyone that allows him to bask in his own less than subtle presence this is not an insult to gere as consider him to be rather talented actor but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role if film is solely about one person the main actor must give faultless performance in order for it to really work although geres performance is in no way poorly acted it is far from perfect and look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry film by himself this is where he truly belongs and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear with the sensational edward norton the jackal with bruce willis and pretty woman with the delightful julia roberts in kirmizi corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear bold and up front who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind it is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail it doesnt take long from the films beginning for jack moores charm to work on pretty chinese lady and in no time they are in bed together in hotel room drunk and cheerful yet instead of hangover poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on couch he is arrested and hauled into chinese prison his cell food and rights all terrible now trapped in foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy lawyer shen yuelin bai ling defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder jack and shen argue about their countries different laws shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family as the plot thickens scenes get progressively more ridiculous ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to scooby doo ending where the least expected but you knew along criminal is discovered red corner is one of those films where you sneer laugh or vomit youre way through all of its minutes what should have been politically taunt thriller is little more than pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act this is not to say that the film does not have its moments there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption but what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place perhaps this is why kirmizi corner is so frustrating to watch if you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly the basic idea is quite tangible it is upon the films execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate the evidence that goes missing the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before if that wasnt bad enough kirmizi corners dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions shen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of destitute relationship with her deceased father whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on plan to free himself taking itself far too seriously kirmizi corner is not half the film it intends to be although it would have benefited from the help of more valuable supporting cast the films main fault is in the bizarre and often out of place way of unfolding story which isnt that meritorious anyway whilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as decent actor would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such serious yet hollow drama again martin vailwhere are you
not so long ago men by the names of peckinpah ford leone and eastwood made westerns real westerns these were some of the best films of the twentieth century those days are gone now we have crap like wild wild west to pass for the western and that record is not improved with the unbearable tale of american outlaws outlaws is yet another re telling of the jesse james legend courtesy of movie king james robinson producer of such classics as wrongfully accused and chill factor delayed since the spring this version stars the irish hunka hunka burning love colin farrell the best part of schumacher tigerland as the bad ass jesse james alas any sense of his character has been left on the ranch leaving us with only cute chicks like ali larter minus the whipped cream to watch the spin this time around fresh from serving as southern militiamen in the civil war jesse james farrell his brother frank gabriel macht and his pal cole younger scott caan lay down their arms and head home to missouri to tend the family farms after the war has ended but trouble is brewing in their small town of liberty when evil railroad baron thaddeus rains harris yulin and his cronies rollin parker terry quinn and allan pinkerton timothy dalton demand the boys turn over their lands to the railroads the jameses and the youngers then join forces to fight the railroad by robbing banks up and down missouri thus cutting off the railroad financial surplus and playing robin hood to the local people along the way the boys squabble over who the cutest of the gang who the most popular cowboy in the gang and who ought to go on mtv total request live they rob numerous banks with identical interiors always with the kindest of hearts strutting in their grungy dusters as moby songs play in the background the witty banter they share could be plastered within hallmark card the biggest disappointment here lies in the acting of colin farrell after great job in tigerland farrell walks through this role easier then nicolas cage in gone in 60 seconds and his american accent rivals richard gere irish accent in the jackal combined with feeling like bonanza the teen years this homogenized production toned down to get the ever popular pg 13 rating gives us an invincible jesse james that quickly grows tiresome and boring the unbearable villains courtesy of timothy dalton and thaddeus rains spend the entire film proclaiming that everyone should be hanged sucking out any energy left in the film not to mention the real story of jesse james and his gang bears no resemblance to the plot of american outlaws instead the movie is full of old outrageous tales about the wild west tales which went out of style in cent magazines about century ago
actually fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie baywatch babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double on the small screen at least there you don have to pay to see her cleavage and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless hate to burst your bubble but there are no full fledged nude scenes in barb wire you wouldn be reading this review right now if had known that fact going in can go back in time and reverse my mistake but can warn other horny teenage boys out there they do tease us few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude it so quick you can even tell for sure whether you re seeing her andersons or not nipple hallucination sort of thing barb wire was adapted from comic book interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like comic book character in real life even wearing low cut leather to do office work businesswoman bondage wear and having unreal body proportions yes like the mona lisa pamela anderson is man made beauty probably in more senses than one she is definite beauty though and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience you just think the woman who began her career as playboy playmate wouldn have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie because it obvious she wasn pulling sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills mean she shows off more cleavage here than jeweler convention the movie is set in the year 2017 the worst year of my life pam says the worst movie of the year say america is going through second civil war and pamela is nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation silicone valley think she also hires herself out as bounty hunter when the price is right posing as first stripper and later as prostitute but don call her babe she hates that and reminds us of that fact way too many times imagine woman who does trapeze strip tease in bar while having hose sprayed on her being referred to in such sexist demeaning term liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn have to hear words like babe during strip tease especially since that movie about the talking pig was such success the plot ha ha revolves around pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate retina scanners in the words of one of the characters they re more than meets the eye reminds me of the transformers cartoon and sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent but that never happened no the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van damme big busted kickboxer and her resistance accomplices ex boyfriend axel tamuera morrison and cora victoria rowell thank god they didn name her cora reef one bad character name is more than enough pamela originally doesn take sides giving some speech about she only loyal to the money they pay her but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother jack noseworthy of bon jovi always video fame still don know if barb wire is step up or step down for noseworthy but he definitely is nose worthy even if he isn sponge worthy pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest it not rambo it bimbo mark my words barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in year it got all the elements of the direct to video releases featured on hbo bastard cousin the cable channel never watch if it didn somehow come free it got the non titillating scenes of voyeurism laughable flashbacks bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo there even narrator at the beginning setting up the movie premise while the words scroll up the screen someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain star wars if you ve seen any action flick of the past fifteen years you ll recognize plenty of lifted elements barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over car crashes explosions broken glass and slow motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death this is one of those automatic pilot movies anyone could write or direct barb wire has only two things going for it and think you know what those two things are
adam sandler isn known for appearing in deep thought provoking films but he still really funny guy most of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them but because they let sandler do what he does best without stupid plot to drown him out big daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than sandler comic performance and it miserable failure sandler plays thirty something loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy played by cole and dylan sprouse as one might expect from the synopsis director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences including repulsive courtroom battle and lot of teary scenes in which characters say good bye to one another in addition there ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself there hilarious running joke featuring female doctor who previously worked at hooters and the film features passable performances from sandler joey lauren adams as the love interest and the two young boys but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny
at the end of an action scene in lara croft tomb raider wall collapses near the nubile warrior with her face on the floor she gazes into the rubble then grins abruptly and says oh my car keys mention this scene because it was the only moment in the whole damned production that made me smile based on an incredibly popular video game lara croft tomb raider is lousy movie the structure goes like this poorly staged action sequence boring exposition poorly staged action sequence boring exposition etc etc the end basically the film exists to showcase angelina jolie puffy lips and enhanced tits close ups are framed oh so carefully to include her million dollar bazooms running scenes highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage baywatch fashion there even include shower scene that offers brief side view of them but the filmmakers are so inept they can even flash the audience correctly the one extended display of nudity is of get ready for this guy for no particular reason muscular supporting character strolls around naked for about 30 seconds with each shot composed to barely cover his package la austin powers now enjoy good looking male body as much as the next gay guy but what the hell is beefcake doing in t&a flick aimed at heterosexual males of course what else should one expect in film that does virtually nothing right tomb raider sets up elaborate action set pieces then renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing promising dual bungee cord battle is ruined by excessive cuts it promises series of exotic locales then delivers cavernous sets and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies throw in some bargain basement computer graphics and you end up with the ugliest movie to come down the pike in many moons intended to be rousing indiana jones style adventure tomb raider lacks any sense of tension the low point comes when lara is threatened by statues of monkey warriors and giant multi armed shiva figure that come to life courtesy of cgi easily the lamest menaces have ever seen the creatures move like snails and fall apart with single shot from gun if you ever have to be chased by monsters pray that you get the monkey warriors tomb raider tells story sort of once every 000 years the planets align group of very bad men are out to find two halves of an object that if reassembled just as the planets align will give them control over time itself lara goal is to stop them and rescue her long missing poppa jon voight jolie real life dad none of this matters though because stunning gaps in internal logic assure that the plot of lara croft tomb raider is as lame as ever other aspect of the film except angelina jolie lips and breasts
when robert forster found himself famous again after appearing in jackie brown he immediately signed up for little film called american perfekt this was almost two years ago waited patiently for the film to be released but it never was finally forgot about it the other day though while was perusing the selection of the local video store stumbled upon you guessed it american perfekt immediately rented it and with certain amount of glee rushed home to view it having now seen the film understand why it never saw theatrical release american perfekt is jumbled mess the storyline is non existent it took me half the movie just to figure out what was going on and at that point the only thing really knew for sure was that the movie was never going to introduce plot of some sort it wants to get by on quirkyness and so called charm alone and it just doesn work robert forster plays psychiatrist who picks up amanda plummer and they head off on the road together along the way to no discernable destination they run into all sorts of kooky and wacky characters suppose this free wheeling no plot style is supposed to give the film an element of danger and excitment but all it did was make me sleepy all for trying new things within the realm of film but not at the expense of coherence nothing in this movie makes sense the actions of the characters go unexplained even when they re truly bizarre ll give you an example without giving too much away david thewlis has part as drifting con man at one point mid way through the movie he runs forster and plummer off the road with his car as he passes them we see that his face is covered in blood do you think we would get an explanation as to what happened to him you would think so wouldn you american perfekt is waste of time nothing is gained from watching this movie except maybe migraine and if you do rent it don bother trying to figure out what going on in the hopes that everything will be resolved by the end this doesn happen and no explanation is given for the misspelling of perfect either
you think that after awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out of video games it hasn worked so far street fighter super mario brothers wing commander mortal kombat not watchable film in the bunch still held out some hope for tomb raider after all the game premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy and all the mummy movies so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept however despite the potential of the project tomb raider proves to be yet another bomb the plot is convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from dozen bad movies there once ever 5000 years alignment of planets coming up and the illuminati have to find both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order to take over the world of course the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world our heroine lady lara croft angelina jolie finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father jon voight dug up she figures that if she gets the triangle she can bring her dad back from the dead of course no one was expecting much of plot from this movie anyway in both video games and action movies the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences however the action in tomb raider shows little style or originality there lots of shooting and some kung fu fightin but none of it progresses beyond the level of cheap direct to cable flick the other goofy archeologist flick of the summer the mummy returns was much better it had its flaws but its action was creative and large scale since winning her academy award for girl interrupted jolie hasn taken any projects that would display her acting talents tomb raider seems to be more interested in displaying her breasts so much attention is drawn to them that it shame there no oscar for best performance by wonderbra while we don see much of her acting ability with the exception of wonderful upper crust british accent we do get hint of jolie less savory side considering the rumors of incest that hang over jolie and her supposed obsession with death having lara be obsessed with resurrecting her dead father and uninterested in any of the living males around her seems poor choice having jolie real life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier haven decided what to make of director simon west yet his first feature was the star studded disaster con air but my opinion of him improved with the general daughter which was thick with sultry atmosphere now this train wreck hope he improves again because his next project is the big screen version of the cult tv series the prisoner hollywood has already screwed up the avengers and the prisoner represents chance for redemption by the way speaking of british tv kirmizi dwarf fans should look for chris rimmer barrie in his first major film role
the last of vampire films offers plenty of blood and gore but beyond that nothing jack crow james woods is professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican his and his men mission is to clean the earth from vampires they have lost count of how many vampires they have slaughtered but one has always escaped them valek thomas ian griffith the dark messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation the siyah cross with the cross in their possesion the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth have never liked john carpenter and his style after seeing this film my opinions have not changed john carpenter remains john carpenter however because of the film self irony siyah humour and fascinating cinematography would say that it is his greatest achievement in long long time neither the synopses or carpenter direction are original but there are some things that are interesting the director negative view on the catholic church for instance at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba maximilian schell has simply used crow and his team to find valek so that he would gain eternal life otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool drinking smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere set in new mexican dessert he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness more than anything in this film this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil the cinematography by gary kibbe is probably the film greatest achievement music composed by john carpenter himself is at times effective the special effects and makeup are likewise worth notice when it comes to the cast in an intellectual film like this casting is the last problem everyone can scream and swing the axe but here james woods is suprisingly convincing he is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter who lost his family to the breed of evil woods is constantly overacting which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self importance daniel baldwin is also entertaining as crow loyal partner the other cast members are struggling because the film doesn take itself too seriously it stays afloat still it is like most vampire films mediocre experience
not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing disturbing behavior with scream maybe it because they re both horror films kinda both have hot young stars both have an annoying alternative soundtrack and both are aimed at the teenage crowd which guess includes me but this is not the next in line with the scream flicks as well as the know what you did last summer soon to be flicks it owes less to halloween and more to kafka and orwell which in my book makes for more interesting feature and it should have been this is basically rehash of the stepford wives the great 70s film never saw starring katherine ross and dealing as ve been told with bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives or something like that behavior starring katie holmes of dawson creek deals with bunch of teenagers deep in angst who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers suck ups preppies it actually at least to me sounds like it would work and with scott rosenberg that witty penmen who has written stuff like beautiful girls and things to do in denver when you re dead as well as con air it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit alas it not and it plumets into that little group of movies known as the movies with potential that blow it remember film called beyaz man burden which dealt with reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with it potentially brilliant premise here another one it could be brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves it stage and this film does in fact realize that it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly now it just needs to work as film which it doesn it too sloppy and too contrived it paints bleak portrait of high school life then lets it lie it brings us bunch of scary monsters who are all bunch of disgustingly icky kiss ups who do food drives and hang out at 50s diner drinking milk shakes then gives it cheap twist when they get horny they become homicidal isn it scary enough that they re like this and can the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them not that you could be next to die the film introduces us two three different characters who in the beginning are considered outsiders because they re not yet part of this clique the new kid steve james marsden dull dull dull dull who having trouble at home because he hasn gotten over his brother ethan embry in quick flashes so you don recognize him did suicide the renegade girl rachel katie holmes from dawson creek who chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring and by far the most interesting kid gavin nick stahl the kid from the man without face who the most interesting because he the only character who given some dimension in the film best scene he introduces steve to every single clique nailing each one fetishes and hang ups and it the best scene in the movie because it witty satirical and interesting something the rest of this film isn gavin suspects there something awry with the preppie kids known as the mavi ribbons and in the tradition of all conspirators and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve he only treated as typical raving conspiracy buff here we have another case of the idiot plot where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him but he may have saved this film from being the dreary dull film that it is without gavin who gives it life and humor the only other half interesting character is the school janitor played by william sadler as retarded scary guy who may not be what he seems to be but really we don care anyway probably shouldn mention that this was directed by david nutter who works for the files because that would probably tarnish his reputation like the show he good at setting up weird conspiracies and creating general creepy feel most of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect and some of it works but what this film is not so good at is coming out with good payoff he keeps too much inside so much that when the characters journey to mental institution in the third act you wonder why they just don get the hell out of there think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there something rotten in the state of teen angstdom what this film needs to be is lot longer lot more colorful and lot creepier if the best villain they can come up with is guidance counselor played by bruce greenwood an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed then they need to come up with tougher smarter villain if he so villainous then why could two dense teenagers who couldn figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in couple minutes the film which runs about 80 or so minutes just needs to work on these things and become lot less sloppy at such short running time and with such lame boring characters as these it pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves horribly unsatisfied taste in one mouth especially mine
in the interest of being generous want to start this review with the scene that liked in meet joe siyah sir anthony hopkins playing super rich media mogul has gathered his family around him for dinner his oldest daughter played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes hopkins frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair does what any man in his position would do he punts whichever one you like dear he says and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do she cries liked that scene for two reasons first the cakes looked really cool second it was perhaps the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act meet joe siyah is chock full of odd performances people doing things for no discernible reason at all and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot it easy to watch meet joe siyah for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani but it even easier to sleep right through it two people on my row managed it quite nicely the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess know my audience had problems with the movie because they thought it was comedy case in point everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie however the first we see of him is as young lawyer in coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani it not clear from the movie whether you need law degree to become the angel of death but it makes certain kind of sense it shouldn take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr pitt and indeed they do after hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished well when that happened the audience howled with laughter and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous so if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing room humor are funny encourage you to go see meet joe siyah immediately anyway the deceased lawyer body no worse the wear from its massive injuries is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role the idea is that death given the pen name of joe siyah so as not to disturb others wants to take holiday and experience the world if this weren hollywood we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death but since it is we get scene after scene of fish out of water humor just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn know how to act in our society it also doesn help that the character of death is written so inconsistently he claims to be on vacation but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani just try to get your travel agent to book that one he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois he knows everything about some characters nothing about others and as played by brad pitt he not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing he just there it as if someone told pitt never mind about acting in this picture son just stand there and look pretty it as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie ve used the phrase angel of death in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt performance with this year best angel performance nicolas cage in city of angels where pitt is cold and unfeeling cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man pitt is aloof and arrogant cage struck instant chemical sparks with co star meg ryan where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani character is so shallow that she can see beyond pitt good looks the movie other top name is much better actor but that doesn save meet joe siyah sir anthony hopkins isn given much better material to work with unfortunately he plays one of these good hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins character more realistically evil hopkins is marked for death due to bad ticker but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world of course no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder but have to wonder and in this movie you have very long time to wonder how you or would act in similar situation especially if you or were multimillionaire hopkins pretty much goes to the office and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated sure stayed awake all the way through meet joe siyah and asking myself why movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest which is what going to do now go spend time with your family go volunteer for local charity heck go take nap don go see meet joe siyah because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death curtis edmonds no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it sideshow bob
cop with troubled personal life ruthless villain friend of the cop _dead_ friend of the cop quest for vengeance new partner romantic interest chase scene chase scene _in san francisco_ woman in peril confrontation an explosion the end yawn yawn yawn the preceding has been the plot of approximately twelve thousand and six action films this one just happens to be called metro have learned to expect little from films like metro and consequently am bored by them more often than am genuinely disappointed with eddie murphy on board however you hope for something extra some kind of spark when film makes watching eddie murphy tedious experience you know it is doing something terribly wrong murphy stars as scott roper hostage negotiator for the san francisco police department who is exceedingly good at his job with his personal life he is considerably less successful facing an unhappy ex girlfriend named veronica carmen ejogo gambling problem and mountain of debt then his professional life gets jolt as well when friend and colleague art evans is murdered while investigating suspected jewel thief michael korda michael wincott finding korda becomes very personal to scott and he joins with new partner kevin mccall michael rappaport to foil korda during an attempted heist but all is not well even with korda in jail as scott veronica and kevin all continue to face life threatening danger metro the title in case you are wondering means absolutely nothing is so badly put together that even the most casual viewer may notice the miserable pacing and stray plot threads in the first place korda rage over being discovered before he can make his big score is rendered completely pointless when he proceeds to hit the target anyway and incidentally to screw it up reference to payoffs in the police department followed by conspicuous decision to keep scott off the korda case and couple of pointed glances is dropped abruptly with no resolution after about forty five minutes even the relationship between scott and new partner kevin is so perfunctory with kevin disappearing entirely after taking bullet for scott that you may yearn for bickering buddies worst of all is plot structure which places the main villain the always menacing michael wincott behind bars for far too long leaving lot of time to kill with the tedious reconciliation of scott and veronica you can blame murphy for being unable to muster any enthusiasm for the scenes with his bland leading lady but he should have known better than to take this role at all scott roper exists in an uncomfortable middle ground between the kind of street wise fast talker murphy has built career on and an actual three dimensional character and murphy is never able to reconcile the two the script seems to have been doctored for him with gambling problem turned into bit of character color and his supposed inability to form relationships turned into cause for gags rather than actual conflict yet there is still too little comedy for murphy to work with for much of the film he walks around with an intense frown and it is over 90 minutes into metro before you hear that trademark laugh for the first time murphy is stranded with too few solid punch lines and nearly all of the ones he does have bounce of ejogo and fall to the ground limply suppose should give director thomas carter credit for taking the obligatory san francisco car chase how much do you want to bet on the likelihood of seeing car soar over hill and doing few interesting things with it as vehicles are sent flying and passengers sent sprawling by runaway cable car it is possible at least for moment to take some pleasure in goofy spin on familiar situation carter does an even better job by taking that old suspense stand by the medicine cabinet mirror which will close to reveal killer standing behind someone and using it to defuse tension not once but _twice_ the fact that carter was able to demonstrate even that much recognition of cliches and willingness to subvert them makes his involvement in the rest of the disaster that is metro all the more puzzling an action film like this plods so relentlessly and obviously from point to point to point that you might find yourself shouting out point while they re still getting to point or getting up with the rest of the audience after the big explosion which signals that nothing else of any consequence is going to happen
can horror movie truly be called horror movie if it has no scares suspense or even eerie elements think not but that what children of the corn 666 issac return wants us to believe the sixth installment in the horrible worn out series is by far the worst to date unlike the other five chapters children of the corn 666 is confusing brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror but either way none of these movies are the least bit scary the film follows hannah natalie ramsey teen looking for her mother in gatlin nebraska on the eve of her 21st birthday what starts out as daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn who roam the cornfields looking for adults to murder that about all that understandable in the film as after we learn this much issac john franklin who led the children of the corn in previous chapter now an older strange man is looking for hannah to fulfill his prophecy and this is supposed to make sense really from the start the film is unclear of where its going not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality and sub plots that have nothing to do with what seems to the main focus of the film the film runs at short 78 minutes but it seems to be more in the vicinity of two hours as the bleak slow pacing makes children of the corn 666 issac return excruciatingly boring plot holes are everywhere in tim sulka and john franklin unbelievably horrible script as nothing is accomplished or clear when the film reaches its conclusion everyone and everything involved with children of the corn 666 issac return namely writers john franklin and tim sulka along with director kari skogland should crawl under rock and hope no one sees their horrible work of trash the bottom line horrible horrible horrible another attempt to revive this worn out genre falls flat and what with that title the devil has nothing to do whatsoever with this film let pray that this is the finale in one of the worst current film series one of the worst horror films in years
arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts since the late 80 but lately his films have been very sloppy and the one liners are getting worse it hard seeing arnold as mr freeze in batman and robin especially when he says tons of ice jokes but hey he got 15 million what it matter to him once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster that can compare with the likes of the terminator series true lies and even eraser in this so called dark thriller the devil gabriel byrne has come upon earth to impregnate woman robin tunney which happens every 1000 years and basically destroy the world but apparently god has chosen one man and that one man is jericho cane arnold himself with the help of trusty sidekick kevin pollack they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world parts of this are actually so absurd that they would fit right in with dogma yes the film is that weak but it better than the other blockbuster right now sleepy hollow but it makes the world is not enough look like star film anyway this definitely doesn seem like an arnold movie it just wasn the type of film you can see him doing sure he gave us few chuckles with his well known one liners but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going it understandable especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources aside form that he still walked through it much like he has in the past few films sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days speaking of action where was it in this film there was hardly any explosions or fights the devil made few places explode but arnold wasn kicking some devil butt the ending was changed to make it more spiritual which undoubtedly ruined the film was at least hoping for cool ending if nothing else occurred but once again was let down also don know why the film took so long and cost so much there was really no super affects at all unless you consider an invisible devil who was in it for minutes tops worth the overpriced budget the budget should have gone into better script where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom it pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into movie do they even read these things anymore it sure doesn seem like it thankfully gabriel performance gave some light to this poor film when he walks down the street searching for robin tunney you can help but feel that he looked like devil the guy is creepy looking anyway when it all over you re just glad it the end of the movie don bother to see this if you re expecting solid action flick because it neither solid nor does it have action it just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing due to strategic marketing campaign save your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience
still can figure out why people went in droves to see this movie now before you go assuming some sort of high brow snob who can appreciate little dumb humor let me say that love cheap humor thought there something about mary was one of the funniest films that have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998 low brow adolescent humor can be lot of fun the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent there is no humor component wanted to like the waterboy really did think only laughed maybe or times throughout the entire movie actually smiled couple of more times on top of that not great record for 90 minute film the problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies those responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is substitute for actual funny material nothing could be further from the truth as matter of fact sandler idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film it really shame too because this film had the potential to be very funny personally believe that sandler is probably very talented comedian it just that so far he hasn been able to find the right film to showcase his talents if his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live most of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry sandler plays 31 year old somewhat mentally challenged waterboy for college football team the team somewhat mentally disturbed coach henry winkler realizes that his waterboy has great deal of pent up rage which if harnessed properly would make him force to be reckoned with on the football field you can figure out the rest from here sandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes football star as said the film had great deal of potential the idea was decent one but the main potential of this movie is result of the cast all of whom are very good just hamstrung by really really lousy material even sandler annoying goofy voice and all has enough charisma and natural comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material even as unfunny as his character is still found myself rooting for him throughout the film but it is the supporting cast that feel most badly about if their material had been just bit better this film could have been such funny movie fairuza balk plays sandler leather wearing biker chick love interest and does great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time winkler is great as the coach who uses coaching for dummies style book to help him get through games the real standout though is kathy bates even with some of the worst material of her career to deal with she is still treat to watch in her role as sandler overprotective and overbearing mama even with the performances of bates and winkler there is absolutely no way would recommend this movie although get the distinct impression that without them this film would have ranked in negative numbers for me which is sad because can really put my finger on particular element of the movie and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became it obvious that those involved specifically the actors tried very hard to make what they thought was going to be funny movie it just too bad that 99 percent of all of the jokes fell flat
gordie boggs arquette aptly cast as moron as he is one and his best friend sean dawkins scott caan the son of james caan should not be reduced to garbage like this are two losers from wyoming with no jobs and no girlfriends who look up to world championship wrestling champion jimmy king terribly casted oliver platt as he is everything they are not they finally get to see him live and he is screwed out of his title by the evil ruthless promoter titus sinclair wasted palitaliano in role originally meant for real life wcw president eric bischoff whose name was written all over the role gordie and sean track down king in atlanta and discover that he is not really the english king the wcw writers created for him but drunken ignorant southerner who is as irritated by these two lunkheads as bob newhart was by larry darryl and darryl they sneak him back onto wcw tv after which sinclair agrees to book him in steel cage match in las vegas at wcw next pay per view against his rival diamond dallas page if he wins king gets his title and his career back plus one million dollars wcw president eric bischoff knowing his promotion was desperate with bad writing and ratings skyrocketing down thanks to the far superior world wrestling federation came up with the idea for this movie hoping it would save wcw he was then fired and rehired two months ago but by the time he left they had already been contracted to do the film and bischoff could not play sinclair which in itself is for the best as anybody who has seen him on wcw programming knows that bischoff is no actor the characters of gordie and sean show you exactly what eric bischoff thinks of his fans he thinks of them as young dumb pathetic idiots who will believe anything that will be put out in front of them is real that is why he doesn take the fans into consideration when he books nitro or pay per view have news for you eric no wrestling fan in this day and age is dumb enough to believe that professional wrestling isn for show unless they are four years old this is 2000 you know not 1985 bischoff will try to cover up criticism like that by saying it is comedy but have no doubt in my mind that if this had been dramatic rocky style film which it probably should have been professional wrestling is ridiculed enough as it is why should the first wrestling movie in ten years be comedy gordie and sean would have been portrayed in the same light anybody who has seen the documentary wrestling with shadows documenting wwf owner vince mcmahon double crossing of bret hart will probably realize via the reviews and previews of ready to rumble that it is basically rip off of that film storyline with the poor man wayne and garth thrown in for comedic affect you can tell titus sinclair is supposed to poke fun at vince but any self respecting wrestling fan knows that sinclair is more inspired by bischoff than vince and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart all of these aspects of the film needless to say seriously offended me as wrestling fan another thing found disturbing about the film was the romance between gordie and nitro girl sasha the lovely rose mcgowan wouldn it have been easier to bring something new into the relationship rather than revealing she was only working on gordie at sinclair insistance hate that cliche the world wrestling federation would have made better film they are the promotion everyone cares about they are winning the ratings they have better wrestlers and they take their fans into consideration and don treat fans like morons so vince how about movie
when arrived in paris in june 1992 was surprised to find france plastered with posters twin peaks fire walk with me since the movie wasn scheduled to open in the until late august happily the film the prequel to david lynch cult television series was playing in fancy thx theater unfortunately the theater was far more impressive than the movie which absolutely stinks much like french lavatory worse actually fire walk with me directed by lynch will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv series or read laura palmer secret diary for twin peaks junkies like me the movie is only marginally improved the plot is jumbled and illogical not to mention excruciatingly sluggish the first 30 minutes which have almost nothing to do with the main story line feature chris isaak and kiefer sutherland as fbi agents investigating murder in portland oregon the movie then stops in philadelphia for nonsensical cameo by david bowie and brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper lynch then drops this plot strand altogether and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks washington one year later ah twin peaks familiar territory you think to yourself as angelo badalamenti distinctive musical score chimes in wrong the movie proves that you really can go home again or at least lynch can only about quarter of the characters from the tv series appear in the movie leland palmer bobby briggs james shelly leo the log lady and few others mostly in meaningless cameos the rest of the twin peaks cast is nowhere to be seen and consequently lynch fails to recreate the spirit and flavor of tv most enigmatic town cast members michael ontkean sherilyn fenn piper laurie and richard beymer are sorely missed not to mention lara flynn boyle who has been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in the crucial role of donna the movie concentrates solely on laura palmer sheryl lee as she suffers through drug abuse prostitution and incest during her miserable last seven days on earth the night of laura death which is truly terrifying is the film only remotely effective sequence we finally get to see exactly what happened to laura after she jumped off james motorcycle and ran into the woods at that lonely traffic light in the middle of nowhere her murder unfolds just as agent cooper reconstructed it in the tv series which is gratifying for faithful twin peaks viewers but it an awfully small reward for sitting through painfully awful movie
capsule this super light situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems the script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not lot different from what is shown free on television the characters are paper thin and the interesting ideas purely non existent this is decrement life by 90 minutes card to +4 jalla jalla is basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen it tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love the film is set in sweden where roro and mans fares fares and torkel petersson are custodians at public park roro is from tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely mans is swede from much more liberal background they spend most of the day in the bushes at their park cleaning up after dogs roro and mans each have girlfriends but each has problem roro nicknamed jalla is having family problems it seems that his family wants to arrange marriage between him and nice lebanese woman yasmin laleh pourkarim but he is already in love with lisa tuva novotny yasmin likes roro but does not want to get married either mans on the other hand has been having problem of sexual impotence the two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other mans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers the one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them roro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other but then plan to break up before the wedding not too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected the plot turns in several places are contrived one knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen lebanese born josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps better director than he is writer when things start to get slow he just adds throws in another story for example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and long chase is added to the film characterization is little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing biological function we do see some of roro family life and his concerns that may be because roro background is lot like that of the director while the story was entertaining did not feel that got anything worthwhile from the film it was just way to pass about an hour and half in my life one does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this rate it on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale
remember tom cruise and brian brown as rival bartenders juggling bottles of booze in cocktail remember how stupid that looked and remember the scantily clad dancers of flashdance getting doused with buckets of water well coyote ugly does those films five better or six better if you count john goodman since here we have piper perado maria bello tyra banks melanie lynskey and izabella miko doing the absolut spinning and jiggling thing while pouring pitchers of perrier all over their semi naked torsos no goodman doesn flip jim beams or wear anything particularly risqu in the film but he does get up on the bar and start gyrating with the rest of them and the central character love interest played by an australian actor named adam garcia proves he can get up on that bar and start shimmying along with the rest of them too what seems to have started life as victoria secret photo shoot quickly deteriorates into one heck of an embarrassing movie violet perado is south amboy hopeful who tries to make it big as songwriter not welder in new jack city as na ve as they come she fobbed off by music producer receptionists by the scorn ful and has her apartment robbed hours after touching down in chinatown and like her mother before her she gets stage fright whenever she tries to do the open mike night thing when she sees trio of babe licious barkeeps thumbing through stack of $20s in an all night diner violet simply has to check out this bar they call coyote ugly lil bello the no nonsense owner agrees to give violet an audition but violet blows it still lil gives violet another chance riot breaks out riots are the order of the day at ugly since the staff are relentless in flaunting their sexual wares flambeeing the bar and soaking the patrons with diet sprite this is certifiable behavior in case didn mention it but violet successfully subdues the crowd by singing along to blondie one way or another on the jukebox she hired and cured since this little episode gives her the confidence to sing in an amateur talent contest where her dad goodman the junk food eating laundry impaired toll collector comes to see her and is as proud as punch the end
confucius once said governing nation is like cooking small fish don overdo it his maxim might be easily applied to writing comedy script for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make granted mike judge writer director of the workplace satire office space isn exactly an amateur his most infamous work the mtv series beavis and butt head was pure altin for its network but unfailingly judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground the iffiness in judge plot group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss is not in its appeal in fact based on the popularity of scott adams cartoon dilbert which will soon have its own television series satirical view of the american workplace is hot item in hollywood unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit length sequences which would be more at home on the set of saturday night live rather than full length feature the most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space which feature almost all of the movie top content this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated other evidence of office space failure to work are its lack of good jokes the comedy is marginally funny at best but not enough to get packed house of theater goers to laugh out loud the material in the movie is on key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting and this could partially explain his work here however the movie is loaded with too many misfires including the token plot to allow for any excuse the plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers headed up by peter gibbons ron livingston at company named initech after the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech the movie introduces us to two consultants john mcginley and paul willson which are in charge of downsizing the company payroll when peter and his gang learns of this as well as the reason behind it so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh gary cole stock will go up they set about creating plan to see his downfall the circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but sympathetic cast and muddled jennifer aniston as love interest subplot are all that keep this one together but it definitely missable in lieu of something more intelligent
it seemed like the perfect concept what better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter than to make movie about guy with split personality it exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care to the wind to get laugh jim carrey signed on too even better the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly as schizophrenia and so forth such protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers fire proving that some people just couldn take joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy yes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie isn funny it not for lack of trying the farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most high concept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites man who after being dumped by his wife for midget limo driver decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them this of course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too forgiving nature making his job as rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult soon enough charlie repressed aggression manifests itself into second independent personality named hank deep voiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster this guy isn above crashing car through the wall of the barber shop in which he been insulted or holding little girl head underwater because she refused to stop jump roping in the street then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film runs off its tracks some have suggested that this isn problem because the farrelly brothers brand of humor doesn require plot to work they re wrong of course plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort 1996 there something about mary 1999 outside providence was technically an earlier project the brothers earlier film wasn funny merely because it contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected in mary the farrellys managed several times to pull off neat sleight of hand trick they have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion me myself irene by contrast seems to have been made by folks who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work having been produced by the same guys who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment the brothers pile on the offensive humor taking shots at race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner of bathroom jokes but they haven come up with way to make any of it fresh most of me myself irene comes off as rote by the numbers adolescent comedy the plot with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene waters renee zellweger who in more trouble than anyone knows back to new york has an ending that entirely predictable from the get go think charlie and irene will fall in love yeah me too the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven already expected them to do no matter how outrageous their actions might be compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing this stuff is almost entirely soft tossed presenting an obvious problem when gross out humor loses its shock value it no longer funny merely gross the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry take for example the subplot involving charlie three siyah sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon the incongruity of it all is funny for while with three burly siyah men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too pleasant smile on his face but by the end of the film they re still doing the same schitck it hasn been elevated to another funnier level and it hasn been dropped either that too bad because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through me myself irene reeks of wasted opportunities there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie new personality and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank actions this doesn really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie condition early on so they don have any opportunity to be surprised by it the film throws what looks like patented farrelly curve in scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script doesn go anywhere with it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax jim carrey is gifted comedian both physically and vocally but he left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in manner similar to steve martin in all of me it great showcase of flexibility and split second role shifting but none of it is terribly funny carrey doesn pull any stunts we don expect him to pull and the farrellys script doesn give him anything else to pull the situations in which he must perform the role shifting aren set up in any meaningful way perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better zellweger irene is not strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strong willed irene is nothing in particular as the film never makes clear whether she ditzy clever or neither as such she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only sane person in the film chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straight laced for movie like this he like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected after viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked but don believe it good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style if the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and still think they are they ll rebound just fine even after that happens though ll still consider me myself irene to be high caliber misfire
there scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book screenwriting made easy this is funny the first time just cause it is but funnier as the film goes on since it totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it outlined it and then wrote this film it like they took the sub genre of the disaster pic which can be fun and hokey at the same time and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them the stupid eccentric characters yes the poseidon adventure is crap but it fun cause of all the stupid eccentric characters and earthquake my god earthquake has got to be one of the worst movies of all time but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold volcano takes semi intriguing yet stupendously inane plot volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts again later then stops only it in dare say it and then puts no stupid stereotypical eccentric characters in it they re just stupid and the actors are all good ones tommy lee jones is great an oscar winner and member of the men in siyah my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer anne heche is good indy actress don cheadle stole the disappointing devil in mavi dress from denzel feet and gaby one of the few good teenage actors but they get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at what going on they do their best god bless them but they re all lost in the fake magma only don cheadle gets an interesting part and he the greatest part of the film there no real suspense here cause you don care about anyone actually was rooting for gaby character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn have to keep saving her he did it like thirty times and there are no interesting sites in that we see get destroyed part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever in independence day the best part other than judd hirsch was watching the beyaz house and empire state building get blown up by the aliens that was cool watching really fake looking magma plow down the street is not okay so the film not devoid of merit as already stated don cheadle was great and the cast does their best and there this really moronic scene which looks cool john carrol lynch norm from fargo goes on subway car to save people but the lava comes and surrounds it he has one guy who wounded and could make it he could throw the guy and jump and still survive but no he has to go and inanely jump and land right in the middle of the lava here the cool sight he melts here the dumb part of it he somehow manages to throw the man to safety as his legs are melting cool sight no logic but cool sight the volcano erupts twice and for some reason the film ends there they aren worried about it eruting again they just go home to their toppled homes but to tell the truth was glad they didn go on was hoping the film was over after the first eruption ended my god it was actually painful to sit through this little 102 minute long film haven seen dante peak but ve heard it masterpiece compared to this if you want to see cool disaster flick that inane but interesting rent the towering inferno with steve mcqueen paul newman and the schweppervescent simpson he saves cat if you want to waste your time watching boring stupid disaster flick literally it almost grossed half of its budget see this but warned you
the yet to be released krippendorf tribe is being marketed as family comedy but buyer beware this movie can make up its mind is it family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies menstruation circumcision and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort either way unbalanced is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort the premise is catchy widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf richard dreyfuss has spent the past two years getting over the death of his wife neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses now it time to show what he achieved in those two years and he has absolutely nothing to show for it with fabricated tale of studying previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous $100 000 grant was spent on trips to mcdonald but when his discovery becomes the latest craze among colleagues the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe he must create it with the aid of his three children the headstrong teen shelly natasha lyonne of everyone says love you the slightly younger mickey gregory smith and the nine year old edmund carl michael lindner the shelmikedmu tribe named from the first half of each child name is born and videos quickly produced in krippendorf backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe despite the professor wishes the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows due in greatest part to veronica micelli jenna elfman an overly vivacious and voluptuous anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorf main assistant hungry for recognition micelli sets up interviews lectures etc in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history sure fire way to go down in the history books krippendorf on the other hand is seeing himself go down jail cell corridor not in history books and with each new lecture he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe mating habits domestic structure etc thru fumbling improvisation and often some quick thinking from his oldest son krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe on the opposing end is krippendorf arch rival ruth allen lily tomlin an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on mission to disprove the existance of the non existent tribe it cute idea and approached with more subtle and mature style krippendorf tribe could ve been real winner sadly the mostly misfired toilet humor overly comical musical score by bruce broughton and sugar coated sentiments all the key ingredients of family comedy just aren the right tone for this film cut that crap out add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and you ve got good start at the state it in now you ve got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs doubtfire meets dumb dumber and that not concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try the overall product here is highly forgettable cup of average with few laugh out loud moments and great big gap in between them most of the characters are surprisingly two dimensional and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort lyonne seems to go greatly unappreciated director todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways it stuck in limbo between disney family fare jungle jungle and potentially hilarious adult comedy fish called wanda it this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down grade and it brutal drop strong warning to parents forget the impression given by advertisements do you want to take your kids to film that has woman asking man if he finds her attractive merely because she holding his penis yes it put that bluntly just be warned this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film and others might not be as tame
it been hours since returned from the much anticipated sci fi opus `mission to mars and can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar why the movie is shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy stapled carelessly onto flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of space opera instead shooting for the angle of feel good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 space odyssey got the feeling that most of my fellow movie going patrons were expecting another `armageddon but no `mission to mars certainly isn one large action sequence about colossal disaster this is supposedly thoughtful family friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel you have been warned of course crafting tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible see `apollo 13 for an excellent example but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off when he gets his hands on an intelligent systematically practical script like `the untouchables or `mission impossible the director has the ability to create sound technical achievement although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally of course there also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name including `snake eyes and the notorious bomb `the bonfire of the vanities all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood that term may be too harsh but if were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient if were gary sinise wouldn touch de palma with 10 foot pole sinise is wonderful wonderful actor but after appearing in `snake eyes and this vomit inducing sham sure he wouldn want to risk the embarrassment of third collaboration the academy award winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell man who recently lost his wife kim delaney and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars oops forgot to mention the year 2020 after barbecue get together for the astronauts we cut to luc goddard don cheadle and his team who are already taking measurements and calculations on the kirmizi planet suddenly towering formation of rocks and soil probably best dubbed `sand tornado appears and creates whirlwind of suction for some reason the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this as if it were lovely piece of art the team is killed within seconds expect for luc who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive immediately second mission consisting of astronauts mcconnell husband and wife woody and terri blake tim robbins and connie nielsen and phil ohlmyer jerry connell are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars let put the `secret on hold for now and discuss the trip there it is explained whether scientifically accurate or not probably not that trip to mars takes roughly six months not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind `m2m didn capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia instead we join the team during their final days aboard the ship what happened during the five months prior to this did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes still there are few nicely tense moments maybe the only in the movie during the time frame involving fuel leak depalma direction is quite good in these scenes although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent organ music in space mon there few good imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud it colossal bummer that `mission to mars is poorly assembled and laughably written with dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists as mentioned before anyone looking for some disaster movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed maybe even cheated after the unbelievably hokey final shot with the words the end somehow adding insult to injury few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen others muttered obscenities shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling `jeez that sucked okay it did suck but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy after all they do pretty well sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as loving nasa couple and funnyman connell well he has couple lines are actually amusing and intentionally so the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive so by golly where did this `mission go wrong looking back on the appalling experience would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have while watching `mission to mars my suggestion would be to immediately abort or better yet don even strap yourself in for lift off
despite its exceedingly well done visual effects 1995 original species was one big hunk of sci fi cheese from the writing to the feeble performances so coming from such grade roots its sequel stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising yet at the same time it is it would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad if not even worse something is clearly amiss when the back door left open for sequel in species sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating body part from the exploded alien human hybrid sil is never entered into perhaps that was left for species iii though not giving away anything when say that this installment has an open back door of its own the alien fun and games begin this time when three person astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain patrick ross justin lazard late of cbs short lived soap of few years back central park west cpw this alien dna is not identical to that which created the original film sil but it close enough and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find meanwhile scientist dr laura baker the returning marg helgenberger has created clone of sil named eve natasha henstridge again for research purposes it doesn take long for eve to sense another alien presence which send her libido into hyperdrive it up to laura and her former partner bounty hunter press lennox michael madsen another returnee and patrick uninfected shipmate dennis gamble mykelti williamson to find patrick before the in heat eve does this isn the files goddammit exclaims one character in the early going in terms of quality he absolutely right but he also wrong the new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick pupils to dilate once he infected looks and sounds an awful lot like the files siyah cancer to me but that not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from species was already ripoff of alien but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the original director roger donaldson did human patrick is given tongue that also has tongue within itself and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve alien body which ironically was designed by alien designer giger large alien hive that our heros douse with substance fired from large guns aliens sans flamethrowers the visual effects were by far the best thing about species and the sequel effects crew at steve johnson xfx inc keeps that high quality tradition alive no cheap looking lost in space cgi here after the effects the original best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge however medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment at one point she called on to play alien empath la forest whitaker in the original but for most of the duration she holed up in glass cell by the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place the film is well into its home stretch so the rest of the time we are treated to patrick played with little zest by lazard one problem with the first film was that the deadly horny but innocent at heart sil was too sympathetic no such problem with patrick who comes off as cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control the rest of the cast also fails to add much but the writing can be faulted for that helgenberger and madsen go through the motions but they are already hampered by the clich development that somewhere between the two films the once linked laura and press stopped getting along williamson suffers the worst indignity he tries his best to enliven the token african american role but how can anyone recite insulting derivative lines such as gonna get african on someone ass and not appear ridiculous but species ii worst crime is being thoroughly uninteresting piece of work at least the original featured plenty to laugh at unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker and the sight of helgenberger character performing fellatio on madsen for start but the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level for all the blood and gore nudity and sex thrown in species ii is quite simply vapid bore
the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john maybury love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon as always jacobi acting is impeccable but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque the movie convincingly argues that francis played by jacobi was completely despicable and vain individual but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude when interviewed by fawning talk show host francis calls his style chance brushstrokes starting with burglary of francis flat the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from cheap horror movie the camera shots are heavy on the avant garde angles lots of wide angle close ups and distorted shots filmed through colored glass reflections the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being sterile examination of lonely and vain man daniel craig in lifeless performance plays the burglar and boxer george dyer when francis lays eyes on him after the break in francis promises not to call the police if he ll stay for sex he stays for the entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares bed he thinks that francis paintings have no bloody use and the movie presents no counterargument writer maybury barely outlines francis character and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain complete enigma we learn little of george other than francis reason for liking him george amorality and innocence francis love of sadomasochism is shown early and often boxing is such marvelous aperitif for sex he reflects to george on the way to watch boxing match as the fighter head is sliced open with heavy blow the camera cuts to gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood francis appears to be in complete ecstasy another of francis favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities as the carnage mounts we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience in film that tries obsessively to shock one dream sequence portrays family in car accident francis mind slowly examines every bloody limb of the mother the father and the boy sometimes the script throws us tidbits of francis wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful optimistic by nature optimistic about nothing loneliness is my only true companion we learn more details about francis makeup techniques than about the man himself he prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning powder for his teeth full of metaphorical interpretations the film best scene occurs late one night when george has to get up to go to the bathroom mistaking francis picture of toilet for the genuine article he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly like parody of bad art house movie love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly by director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling by the end the audience hasn learned any more than it could have in three minute sketch love is the devil runs 30 the film is not rated but should be considered nc 17 for violence profanity graphic sex nudity and sadomasochism and is unacceptable for most teenagers
payback brian helgeland inauspicious directing debut coincidentally he previously penned the award winning screenplay for 1997 confidential is wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea movie with non stop violence death and villains and runs with it or should say barely manages to crawl away with it mel gibson in yet another disappointing picture conspiracy theory and lethal weapon anyone stars as the reprehensible villain hero porter man who becomes determined to get his 50% share of $140 000 which he stole in robbery back when his partner in crime gregg henry and drug addicted wife deborah kara unger double cross him shoot him and leave him for dead porter is not dead however not by long shot as he quickly rehabilitates and along with his loyal prositute girlfriend rosie maria bello sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay the tagline for payback is get ready to root for the bad guy and sure enough this is true as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way wouldn have problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest but it wasn and therefore found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever no attempt is made to flesh the roles into three dimensional characters and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them just because the protagonist bad guy is played by mel gibson doesn mean will root for him and didn quite the contrary every person in the movie deserved to die gory death although some of them did anyway just to spice up the dull proceedings since none of the respectable actors in payback actually have human beings to play only one performance managed to stand out lucy alexis liu of ally mcbeal who plays spicy s&m dominatrix brightens up every scene she is in and has definite flair for comedy something would have liked to have seen more of since most of the humor fell with resounding splat meanwhile gibson who is perfectly fine here sleepwalks through role that is not the least bit challenging unger who made an impression in 1997 the game is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such part since she disappears ten minutes in and only has two purproses to get high on heroin and because she plays key part in an early flashback finally kris kristofferson appears in throwaway role during the climax and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like sore thumb tellingly he didn appear in the original cut of the film but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later like most action movies the star often takes licking but keeps on ticking in the course of the 102 minute running time of payback porter is shot three times in the back hit by van beaten up and has his feet smashed with sledgehammer and guess what not only does he survive the whole ordeal but he is happy go lucky in the penultimate sequence and can still walk even though he looks like he had recently substituted for punching bag payback is not in any way an entertaining film even though am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is blank screen perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this so he could have at least added few worthwhile elements like fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for few hours
did do something bad must have because sitting through this movie was sheer punishment here the plot ricky jeff goldblum is producer of the good buy network one of those 24 hour home shopping channels the new boss robert loggia plans to can ricky behind if he doesn turn the previous months flat sales numbers around and to add to his problems ricky also has to work with kate kelly preston the ivy league wunderkind whom the boss has brought with him kate and ricky don get along and don have any great ideas until they meet eddie murphy spiritualist who sees something positive in everything his soothing voice and simple logic makes people feel good and it this quality that will make the new gbn television star and the key to the network success the first problem is flaw in the plot sure makes people feel good sure we re told that most people feel guilty after buying an impulse item no matter how wealthy they might be and ll even believe that talks talk that allows people to feel good about what they ve bought but hey that after they ve bought it why do sales skyrocket the first time is on camera far from trying to sell the product instead blathers on about how you don even need the thing someone please tell me how this is supposed to move merchandise in the first place you might say that people feel good about what they ve bought so they come back and by more but due to the simple fact that the first round of sales in inexplicable not convinced this is what the filmmakers had in mind the whole movie is therefore seriously undermined because the key point in the plot is never credible another problem is in the humor you know if you see that eddie murphy is in movie think it is not unreasonable for you to expect that the film is comedy whoa partner are you in for surprise holy man is not funny murphy the one asset you think this movie has remember how they brought him in at the last minute to save best defense then again maybe you don is seriously reigned in the script gives him almost nothing to work with and it seems as though director stephen herek kept him toned down so that the other actors in the film wouldn be left as window dressing there only one moment in the film where murphy is allowed to let loose and it lasts for three shouted words which seem totally out of place as result pathetic in all there are about three jokes that work in the entire picture and they re not even that great as side note there are some cameo appearances such as dan marino pitching contraption which allows you to cook off of your car engine and james brown introducing medic alert device that shouts help me just like the hardest working man in show business at the push of button but these never cause your personal laugh meter to rise above the level of mild bemusement well you ask surely there must be some convincing performances to make up for the lack of humor think again buckwheat jeff goldblum disappoints kelly preston is flat but not like that robert loggia in the kind of role for which he has been virtually typecast can do anything with it the script is part of the problem but these actors don even look like they believe in the move they re making they look lot like they re bored just like the audience so what do you have when the humor is absent from your comedy and the acting is like the siberian steppes film that drags more than dropped anchor but wait as if these problems don make the film slow enough the screenplay pacing makes the movie even slower it takes the entire first half hour to establish the movie premise then more time as the film wades through tortuous and seemingly mandatory romance between ricky and kate and sub plot involving conniving pr man eric mccormack who wants to discredit and take over ricky job as producer when the pr guy plan is foiled the film is climaxes we re treated to that little epilogue and then we can all go home right wrong the movie goes on for another half hour continental drift is the indy 500 compared to the pace of holy man the only thing holy about holy man will surely be the number of people exclaiming holy @#% that movie was awful this one is for the truly pious
plot something about bunch of kids going into haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and non horror movies oh yeah there also something about ghost possessing the mansion and shit but trust me you won care much about the plot in this film critique parody movies either work or they don and this one just doesn work the laughs aren as pronounced this time around the energy level the gags and all of the characters just seem to be going through the motions here it like they were all in hurry to finish the film or something wink wink and the scariest part of it all check out the number of screenwriters it took to pen this puppy seven say again it took seven people to write 82 minutes worth of fart jokes half assed stunts and spoofs of films other than horror now not exactly sure if each of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed funny sketch ideas out there while smoking the chronic themselves but the end result is film that basically plays out like an extended skit on saturday night live there are couple of funny one liners but mostly just rehashed one joke scenes lot of dead silence and lame gags add to that the very unoriginal title and movie poster and you gotta start asking yourself if anybody was even trying here the film website isn even up yet what the do however have to give it up to james woods the man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody of them all the exorcist take off miss this and you ve missed any reason to see the flick especially liked his one liner as he walked in to see the possessed woman head turning very funny unfortunately the film plummets straight down after that with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do with horror such as save the last dance and dude where my car and other action movies like charlie angels and mission impossible now help me figure this one out will you isn this supposed to be parody film of horror movies or maybe that just the title of the film ing with my head well sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this film is its lame ass script the wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers money instead of the zucker brothers comedy for this sequel unfortunately for us all we re left with here is skeleton of film which might ve been funny had it been worked over few more times tightened up here and there and been injected with more solid laughs but as things stand now there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last year film has led everyone down this path so screw them for not trying as hard critically speaking of course you should all be ashamed of yourselves for not putting enough real effort into this chop job and for not providing your fans with the ultimate of your talents pooh on you that telling em joblo sheesh btw allotting one point alone to actress kathleen robertson whose massive breasts and skanky string had me chompin at the bit you go girl everyone else stay where joblo coming from airplane 10 10 airplane ii 10 10 galaxy quest 10 hannibal 10 the haunting 10 mafia 10 naked gun 10 scary movie 10 top secret 10
the cartoon is way better that the bottom line on disney incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature the alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced frenetic home alone with puppies and not much else when production of this remake was announced the big question seemed to be why the original cartoon still works so what the point the answer it appears is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandising campaign the story for those of you who missed childhood is simple two dalmatians pongo and perdy fall in love at first sight they drag their human pets together and in short time both couples marry the heavenly match ups turn chaotic when pongo and perdy new born pups are stolen their dog napping engineered by the evil cruella devil who wants them for their pelts everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in frantic effort to save the puppies in the original movie the animated pooches had broad range of facial expressions and distinct personalities we also could hear them talk which quickly established crucial element to the charm of the film the dog view of humans as their pets in the new version the dogs are mute and expressionless hughes attempts to give them character with repeated shots of the dalmatians draping their heads over each other and licking their faces and necks while he drew the desired aww they re so cute reaction from the audience it was quickly followed by several people whispering wonder what kind of food they smeared on the dog heads to get them licking like that the canines lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had little joely richardson and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles in previous films daniels successfully played off his beyaz bread persona in something wild he revealed the rebellious thrill seeker beneath his neutral demeanor in terms of endearment his hapless appearance masked cold manipulative womanizer here he and richardson are so consistently bland that it wonder their images even stick to the film glenn close however has no problems establishing distinct personality as the villainous icon cruella devil she tears up the screen in deliciously over the top performance close matches the intensity of the animated cruella by becoming cartoon herself with two tone fright wig kirmizi gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips garish animal skin outfits and stiletto heels close bursts through her scenes like force of nature she clearly having ball playing this monstrous icon and her wicked glee is infectious when she spits out lines like you ve won the battle but about to win the wardrobe the film comes briefly to life 101 dalmatians is crammed with john hughes typical heavy handed approach to comedy after an ingenuous opening showing pongo morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on careening trek through city park little slapstick goes long way but hughes just keeps laying it on the second half of the film where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil and her henchmen is tedious home alone clone with the bad guys enduring variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy scratchy cartoon including thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence 101 dalmatians has cute puppies and hoot of performance from glenn close but not enough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick bland characters and unconvincing animatronic raccoons high fiving one another rent the cartoon
spawn may be somewhat of an older film in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn seen it will finally get to see it that is if they see it but managed to catch it before it made it way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and god forbid video cassette purchasing it wasn the worst film of year by any means it isn even on the top of the worst films of the year but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten which in simpler terms means it comes in at number on my worst of 1997 list the only reason it doesn come in lower is thanks to the special effects which might actually have been some of the best of the year performances however were either wooden or for the most part unforgivingly campy in fact this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness even the editing seemed to boast campy quality don know how to explain that one it wasn exactly choppy but something about it seemed well annoyingly unprofessional john leguizamo almost makes it as clown but not quite he is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional but the main problem found with spawn as with most films that wind up on my worst of lists is that it was just plain boring wouldn even say there was climax to the film sure it had the big battle scene at the end but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing conclusion never too soon the movie did conclude in very simple disappointing way even though it one of the shorter movies ve seen this year it one that would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again like said the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride no matter how small was impressed with the opening sequence so long as didn allow the melodramatic voice over and lobotomizing editing to get to me and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawn outfit created but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes which looked quite bit like modern video game who knows if spawn the video game wasn part of the plan from the beginning keeping in mind that the film was based on comic book makes it somewhat more approachable and in very small amount makes up for the cheeziness of it all but none of this movie saving graces can it make it something recommend seeing no matter what the price of admission this movie is definitely not for young children which shouldn really be problem seeing as how only teenagers if anyone would likely find it appealing if you really want to catch movie there are many better ones out there no matter what your tastes might be trust me spawn has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers
it time to take cover after hiatus of about fifteen years the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest in early 1997 there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone one on television and two in the theaters with dante peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar of the two had heard that dante peak was the better film so decided to check it out when it was released on video the film begins with slow motion scene of people in third world country trying to evacuate their little town the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is volcanic eruption flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky crushing homes and people we see people panicking people crying and even horses rearing it is disaster of biblical proportions signified to us by one person dragging cross down road symbolism doesn get much more blatant than that we learn that harry dalton pierce brosnan volcanologist with the geological survey was there with his wife when the eruption occurred harry survived but his wife did not few years later harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante peak washington which we are told has been voted second most desirable place to live under 20 000 by the readers of money magazine there harry meets rachel wando single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante peak and proprietor of small coffee shop although the mayor doesn seem to be alarmed by the presence of man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up few members of the city council are they are afraid that harry presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante peak they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug however when an amorous young couple takes skinny dip in the local hot springs they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from small fissure underneath thus begins chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption this film contains number of cliches the amorous couple is one as soon as they doff their clothes you know they re going to die the town busybody and the abrasive mother in law make appearances as does the death defying dog countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable watching the movie was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements but some of the dialogue as well unfortunate since much of the dialog is terrible for example harry boss paul charles hallahan and team from the geological survey join harry to assess the situation paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry eruption predictions aren cause for alarm this causes harry to leave in fit of rage only to turn up the next day ready for work when paul asks harry why he stayed he says with grim determination cause this town in trouble and the best man you ve got even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving he likens the situation to how frog will jump out if dropped into pot of boiling water if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up however the frog won move and will allow itself to be cooked is that your recipe for frog soup asks one of the team members it my recipe for disaster responds harry dante peak has singular talent for pointing out the obvious our heroes are in boat in the middle of lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming in very grave tone acid eats metal thanks for the tip when we first see the geological survey building there caption labeling it as such this wouldn have been so bad if it weren for the fact that the caption is right above sign on the building which reads in large letters geological survey suppose the caption is for people who can read signs although harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film the viewer has no idea why there is severe lack of chemistry between the two characters and the relationship seems rushed because of this when they get close to kissing was asking myself why do they want to kiss were they even attracted to each other if were the mayor would sure think twice about kissing guy who doesn even crack smile through the whole movie trying to pull off the rough yet debonair act who does he think he is james bond the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed there are several warning signs prior to the eruption itself but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don feel as if they are leading up to anything for example one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve remote controlled robot tremor occurs does he plunge headlong to his death is he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below no couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg the sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene which suppose was intended to be dramatic as well it wasn one plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante peak in disaster movie there usually one guy who greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption fire earthquake explosion tsunami tornado meteorite and usually gets killed by the disaster it okay of course because we all think he got what he deserved if you re going to be unoriginal you might as well go all the way in dante peak the city councilmembers are concerned but they don really try hard enough maybe the mayor abrasive mother in law should have been the one for no apparent reason she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate there are couple of good things about this movie the first is the scenery there are panoramic shots of forests lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful the second is the special effects they are the closest ve ever seen to real pyroclastic eruption but when elements which don speak are going to be the best parts of your movie you probably better rewrite the script
capsule ham handed and over underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment so muddled it doesn even know what it really advocating if anything time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations and it easy to see why it presents strong almost rancorously so story it is full of good actors samuel jackson matthew mcconaughey sandra bullock kevin spacey charles dutton and it ostensibly about some important social issue that we re all tangling with it is not however good movie and all of the reasons ve listed above have something to do with why right from the beginning the movie is dead set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible pair of redneck whites boozed and drugged out of their minds kidnap young siyah girl abuse and rape her horribly and leave her for dead after their arrest their father jackson takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial mcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics the acting is not quite what it should be given the cast we have sandra bullock who is good actress but not serious one looks clueless spacey accent switches itself on and off at random and he given totally thankless role to play as well role without an iota of depth and mcconaughey role is stamped from the cardboard back of cereal box the most memorable role is donald sutherland and his is bit part always consider it an index of movie desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact there is one scene riot outside the courtroom that should have created incredible tension but winds up playing out like textbook exercise on how not to deploy scene like this because the movie doesn know what it really about it can generate any genuine tension and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting one of the ways it does this is by throwing in whole subplot about bunch of vicious kkk cross burners which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic was reminded of the despicable betrayed which tried to tart up fundamentally empty story by injecting vile graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention getter the movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making few critical mistakes first of all the jackson character is not hard to judge there no tension in his dilemma he self admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail no matter how moral his crusade the old saw about how no court in the land would convict him if he was beyaz is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie but it never developed into an organic component of the story it just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics another mistake is in motivational logic by not having the two beyaz thugs arraigned first or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence say we have that much less empathy for jackson character probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped we are automatically supposed to feel empathy for him but that precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible see the virgin spring for more on that note is jackson character then simply insane that prospect isn given terribly serious treatment either one of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works or how lawyers get their information mcconaughey character makes an important slipup late in the movie when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of capital offense how did the prosecution get this information how come he didn get it the whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam bang fashion this is the biggest problem the movie isn about jackson character or his dilemma or this case or any of its frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction characters it not ultimately about anything at all except its stupid geared down plot which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards totally contrived ending at two and half hours the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten there endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing and no writing about the material that should really matter it all handwaving the closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair it not easy to make movie about something the other day saw kurosawa phenomenal rashomon movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality or don time to kill is as empty and ponderous movie as ve seen in long time
deep rising gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively not only does the movie take place on cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by squid like menace but the unfolding story is artificial silly and almost completely derivative of countless other and for the most part better films while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures take for example the schlocky mountain highs of last spring anaconda deep rising has no tongue to put in its cheek folks we re only month into the new year and already here candidate for one of its stinkiest releases most of the action takes place on the argonautica luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage uh oh if these people had seen titanic then maybe they have known to stay home when it attacked by giant tentacled sea creature the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian famke janssen argonautica owner canton anthony heald and few other crew members mercenary team lead by resourceful captain john finnegan treat williams board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby but what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood soaked hungry and not very helpful the main problem with deep rising is its overt familiarity the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci fi horror films in recent memory the concept is leviathan meets titanic with dash of speed thrown in for good or is that bad measure this monster is equal parts 20 000 leagues under the sea and the relic knows how to open doors like the raptors from jurassic park and even gets to expel half digested victim neat effect admittedly la the giant snake in anaconda some of the attack sequences are straight out of jaws and alien scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of alien resurrection there even jet ski chase like hard rain and the list goes on watching deep rising cast battle the beast is murky chore in itself because none of them have well developed characters nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy williams is affable enough but his finnegan just isn believable an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted pretty famke janssen best known as goldeneye killer thighs is trapped in forced romantic interest with williams while kevin connor as finnegan mechanic provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast djimon honsou who received raves for his performance as noble slave in december amistad pops up in brief part he needs to stay away from the water the movie final shot is groaner as is the 11th hour regurgitation of subplot involving an on ship saboteur as if cast deserving of their snack food fate isn bad enough when you taunt the monster you re really asking for it deep rising is slow stupid slog through story without single bright spot and since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is the closer we are to the end of the movie rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn out of the question
mandingo has traditionally been seen as one of two things either much needed revisionist look at slavery in the south or in the words of film critic leonard maltin trashy potboiler that appeals only to the s&m crowd actually think mandingo is strange combination of the two although it fails on both fronts it too trashy to be good drama but too dramatic to be good trash the story takes place on dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell james mason and his son hammond perry king one day in new orleans hammond comes across slave trader selling mandingo named mede heavyweight boxer ken norton although the movie never explains it mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley according to the movie mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him hammond then spends his time training mede to be fighter in money brawls with other slaves meanwhile hammond has married his cousin blanche susan george because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce grandchild hammond however is happier spending nights with his bed wench the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex it is quickly apparent that hammond despite his overt racism is more in love with his bed wench sensitive slave girl named ellen brenda sykes than he is with blanche hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had pleasured her before he did of course it fine that he slept with numerous slave girls but the fact that his wife beyaz lady had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her so blanche is usually left lonely and sex starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to half black child although it okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth and hammond poisons blanche hammond then finds mede shoots him twice in the shoulder and pushes him into giant cauldron of boiling water yes you read right the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive judging only by the plot mandingo is pure sexploitation the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society when mandingo was released in 1975 it was still bit of shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such graphic detail this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs dramatically mandingo is weak and unfocused and historically it mostly confused if one were to judge history by this film it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality not economics not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working except for few house servants the men spend most of the time sitting around while the sole purpose of female slave seems to be free sex for the owner there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves but mandingo overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of cheap sex flick although there plenty of violence fights vicious beatings shootings and the aforementioned human boiling sequence thrown in for good measure some tried to write off mandingo as blaxploitation film one of number of quickly made low budget films appealing to siyah sensibilities in the early seventies but it not that easy mandingo was studio financed by paramount pictures and produced by dino de laurentiis the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as the bible 1966 the remake of king kong 1976 and the ill fated dune 1984 the director was richard fleischer veteran who was best known for several special effects laden action movies including 20 000 leagues under the sea 1954 and fantastic voyage 1966 as well as such superior suspense films as the narrow margin 1952 the script based on the supermarket best seller by ken ostott and the subsequent play by jack kirkland was penned by norman wexler who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on serpico james mason perry king and susan george were well known and respected actors mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt and ken norton appeared to have promising film career so why is mandingo so bad number of reasons including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did lousy job wexler script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive it combines stereotyped slave talk yessuh massuh stereotyped southern beyaz trash talk fer whut re you gittin outta bed and stereotyped contemporary militant siyah talk if you see me hang you gonna know you killed siyah brother fleischer direction is clumsy especially during the fight scenes and all the actors give weak performances especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable nevertheless credit should be given where credit is due despite its exploitative nature mandingo was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery until then there had been kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery even classics such as gone with the wind 1939 can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter mandingo reassessed the south and showed that it wasn all beautiful plantations green fields and pretty sunsets but all this is constantly undermined by the film negligible point of view it claims to see things from the siyah perspective but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the beyaz owners with little more maturity and different handling mandingo might have been an effective worthwhile film while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery it never deals with them the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile but wexler script refuses to move them beyond surface level of trashily vicarious viewing there is great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of sexual relationship between slave and owner but mandingo never does it steven spielberg touched on that same topic in schindler list 1993 by looking at nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for jewish maid the difference between that film and mandingo is that spielberg dealt with the situation in fair unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma mandingo is satisfied to simply show some skin and because of that its trashy potboiler nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished
the above is dialogue from this film taken almost completely in context and not jazzed up bit to make it more inept than it is it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film and basically serves as perfect example of what this film is about especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously mr gregg having mid life crisis araki the writer and director of this film wants to show how important teenagers are and wants to show how they feel in such horrible horrible world and how does he show it by really cheap surrealism and moronic exchanges like this oh and it gets better similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of oh dunno the fiftieth sex scene in this film not counting the several masturbation scenes in it one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another and he says to her something along the lines of do you ever wonder what life is all about sorry man foreplay takes place before the act of coitus of course what do you expect the film was written and directed by guy who can even spell his first name right yes know it cheap joke but it had to be done the doom generation is advertised as road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them and also as another teen angst film one of the slogans is teen is four letter word hardy har har it film about two angsty teens amy mavi rose macgowan who would later play the buxom tatum in scream and jordon beyaz james duval who would go on to play randy quaid son in independence day who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac xavier kirmizi jonathan schaech who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in that thing you do and by the way do you get the symbolism red beyaz and mavi huh huh and go on road trip where three things happen in no order they have sex they run into weird people they kill them the film is basically remix of bunch of other far superior films gregg araki obviously has seen such films as easy rider natural born killers and kalifornia and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like pop culture reference guide but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper the doom generation doesn want to do this it just wants to show everything in surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level he wants to show everything in weird manner and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about here one scene an earlier scene in the film amy and jordan go into quick mart type place to get food and other stuff amy is smoking and the clerk an asian man mind you love how racist this film is really do tells her to put it out she tells him to fuck off or something to that note he points shotgun at her and she puts it out reluctantly jordan makes two hot dogs and takes them to the counter the cash register rings up 66 oh and this symbolism doesn stop here jordan checks for his wallet but it really in the car he asks amy for it but she left her wallet in the car as well the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money they say they don have it he gets ready to kill them but then xavier who they ditched in the middle of nowhere scene before pops out of nowhere fights with the clerk and ends with him blowing the clerk head clean off clean wound mind you the head is shown flying through the air and lands in fryer where it begins to scream don really object to this kind of sick violence but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only to gross you out araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme he ll make some kind of art wrong it takes kind of resistance to make gore art when george romero made dawn of the dead very gory flick even for today he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick same goes for peter jackson disgustingly gory dead alive which features 30 minute long fest of blood guts dismemberments flesh chewing and other assorted stuff all ending with guy with lawn mower strapped to his body taking out all sorts of zombies it was sick but it was also satirical and controled scene like this has no purpose in the film and it sticks out from everything else that happens here couple other scenes jordan and amy have sex in bath tub and xavier watches masturbates and then licks the semen from his hand xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window masturbates and falls backwards man attacks the trio and is stabbed in the crotch by giant sword put there just so this could happen fast food employee stalks the trio and his arm is shot off by xavier and various other annoyances also look for about million camoes from wide assortment of people who probably didn really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it just like peter toole helen mirren malcolm macdowell and john gielgud probably didn when they signed to be in caligula people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel hollywood madam heidi fleiss christopher peter brady mcknight amanda bearse and margaret cho all grace the screen for matter of seconds then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line why are they here so that we can all point to them and say hey look it fill in the blank wow gimme break the film meaning is pretty easy to detect that you know teens are so precious and the world is such horrible place that when the two entities collide there giant explosion of horrific violence otherwise defined as teen angst or the belief that being teenager is horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you look 19 years old went through very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did ve since moved on to don really know what to do with my life phase but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they re dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse part of being teen is experimenting and testing the waters it not whining about how awful parents are and purposely feeling dispondent this is what the characters in this film do and the film wants to show how they re these great people who are being punished by the world because they re teenagers and how they try to defend themselves but can totally overcome them it not their fault they kill people it the world what they really need is reality check the world is bad place and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting but part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed and there nothing they can do about it hence the title not only does it have bad fallacy but it can even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner everything overly surreal and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst how does talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction he show them for what they really are and if he didn want the satirical approach he show the real problems with the world and if you still don think that the doom generation is incompetent on every single possible level it could be take the acting rose macgowan is horrible yes she proved herself talented in scream but she so bad in the doom generation that if had not seen her in scream would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today her entire performance is one note bitchy and the one scene where she cries over dead animal is so forced that it laughable equally bad is jonathan schaech who wants to be the slacker serial killer someone who doesn have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain his performance is annoying as hell and granted he was better in that thing you do and then there james duval let just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando he has the same kind of slacker stuttering only much much much worse and every line he says is so bad that have now deemed him least talented actor in the world have seen lots of bad actors but james duval has got to be the worst or at least somewhere up there here another example of bad scene if you re still not convinced the film opens up in club where they re playing nine inch nail most banal song heresy example of the lines god is dead and no one cares if there is hell ll see you there and as the song plays and kirmizi strobe lights show the patrons dancing the film pans over to amy just standing there looking dispondent the film closes in on her she looks right at the camera and says fuck no explanation of this should be necessary and finally note to gregg grow up really move out of your parent basement read something other than salinger and get day job and don quit it
ladybugs is typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees the pathetic team who beats the champs cross dressing and the presence of rodney dangerfield this picture doesn play like comedy for children so who is it aimed at and why is it told like 91 minute sit com instead of feature film rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee total schmuck working at huge corporation he obviously doesn have lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead which he does by volunteering to coach the company girls soccer team what shock to learn chester and his assistant julie jackee know absolutely nothing about the game and the players seem to know even less didn laugh but for some reason it didn annoy me that much chester fiancee bess graff thinks he got promotion in addition to the coaching position and of course she has slacker for son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams jonathon brandis is nice surprise as matthew who agrees to dress up as girl named martha to help out chester probably because the girl he has crush on plays on the team what original story ideas what we get is just another retread of the underdog sports team mixed with some cross dressing unfortunately the film isn smart enough to play upon the drag aspect in fact it downplays it so heavily it totally unbelievable could it be any more obvious martha is boy he only wears girl wig without any makeup and they don even give him falsies brandis doesn bother to mimic girl voice either then there is pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for dress but for what reason martha is only seen on the soccer field why would they buy dress for her just when we think the martha character is going to be useful she disappears and the story wanders aimlessly looking for new plot to pick up on when bess discovers what really going on she breaks up with chester and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss this film could ve been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary and bad at that there just too much of sit com feel here especially during the so called serious moments and all the confusion between the characters ve seen worse movies than ladybugs but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm so even when it turns sour it doesn seem as bad as it is dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end but at what price
the happy bastard quick movie review the concept of enjoying stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid really shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control sadly that is the case with kingpin film directed by the farrelly brothers the duo that brought us there something about mary and dumb and dumber since the duo directed and didn write the script can assume that part of the problem the story seems good enough pro bowler in the 1970 by the name of roy munson woody harrelson is sitting on top of the world his popularity has gone through the roof and he getting his career off the ground then however he runs into ed mccracken bill murray rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for well anything these two form an ill timed relationship that involves risky betting and before roy sees it coming ed abandoned him and he about to lose his hand in bowling ball machine forward seventeen years later where roy has become quite the loser complete with mechanical hand torn up car and of course the occasional knocking up of the ugly ass landlord to avoid paying rent for while however he finds glimmer of hope upon visit to local bowling alley where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael randy quaid who has quite the bowling arm with the kid help he figures he can be known again particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno nevada of course the amish kid needs some coaxing particularly when you consider well he amish this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film such as roy process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow finally the duo get on the road and along the way pick up an additional helper beautiful hustler played by the gorgeous vanessa angel the main problem had with kingpin wasn the fact it wasn funny in fact it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it such as the aformentioned above and roy explanation of not having children something involving cheese grater but that just it scenes there couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex boyfriend mean was this really necessary couldn have this been handled just bit wackier mean this is comedy why throw ethics in particularly in farrelly brothers vehicle where hair gel can be easily mistaken that really ruined it however and that too bad the acting is top notch especially from angel and murray and the really funny scenes are worth noting still if you re going to think dumb think dumb all the way through ok at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or still be little bit irked
shagadellic groovy baby smashing adorn the page ad for this movie tabbed as the #1 comedy in america as of may 8th did we attend the same movie at 87 minutes it seemed overlong like snl skit on steroids and at any length it seemed unfunny yes the sets and costumes were an interesting exaggeration of 60s pop frills and yes the concept dealing with 60s secret agent pop icon played by myers awakened from his cryogenic slumber to battle his arch enemy dr evil also played by myers in the present day had great deal of potential fun costumes and scenery and potential do not movie make so lets throw in hefty dose of bathroom humor don get me wrong like good bubbles in the bathtub joke as much as the next person but to have this type of humor be the funniest thing about your movie is waste of yuor talent and my money but the way things work these days in the movie business all film has to do is call itself the funniest and people will believe it do give this film stars because of the sets costumes and sadly unmet potential
the catch phrase for disney rocket man is one spoken by fred randall harland williams the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes it wasn me he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is williams can take all the blame but he sure can justify himself with his own simple tag line either fred has dreamed of space travel since he was young boy turning the clothes dryer into mock space shuttle and staring out wide eyed at poster of the earth as 30 year old fred hasn grown up much but at least he somewhat closer to his goal now designing astronaut software for nasa when an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void fred yes although he an obviously klutzy moron nasa doesn think twice about throwing him into rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program and time itself has ever known for the first part of the film we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park he laughs he screams but he never once breaks sweat or views the preparation as anything more than child play his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many record breaking feats much to the dismay of cocky counterpart mission commander captain overbeck william sadler who once held the records overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the kirmizi planet one being astronaut julie ford the stupids jessica lundy and the other being chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist from here on out we are subjected to one lame gag after another dealing with snot laxatives and flatulence you know standard kid movie material almost sounding like poor james stewart impressionist williams is awful in his first starring role we get the feeling that if jerry lewis and pee wee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring williams would be it while he not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany stupid comedy he just as unlikeable to say it more understandably jim carrey might annoy you more but this guy is even less funny why because while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such role his performance is too understated and boring classic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy stan laurel for example was so innocent in all his trouble making that we were immediately fond of him peter sellers as inspector clouseau was so self assured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip it was humor at it best williams on the other hand can garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his anti glory as for the rest of the cast including some bigger names in smaller roles beau bridges and shelley duvall nobody is worth watching whatsoever this is just another example of the fast food equivalent of cinema mass produced less than mediocre over priced and hard to stomach giving it one and half stars is extremely generous but even ll admit to laughing few times the amazing thing is that even in theater packed with little kids laughter was something rarely heard even from the children must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didn crack up over every little thing then again maybe they were asleep some people might think critics are harsh on kid movies claiming adults aren the targeted audience and therefore aren meant to and won enjoy them sadly it also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if it presented right two hour still shot of dog with cartoonish voice over could entertain lot of toddlers out there but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast which could easily do the same thing and saying that parent perspective isn important is quite poor theory to have when they re the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place
based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad victory spins tale of pair of lovers heyst william dafoe and alma irene jacob who seek refuge on heyst isolated island however their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones sam neil martin ricardo rufus sewell and their servant pedro graziano marcelli who have come to steal heyst rumoured plunder while the novel is largely complex in characterization the film sadly transposes conrad characters into lacklustre leads the most disappointing being heyst himself conrad heyst adheres religiously to his late father ways of detachment and isolation his ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice the struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude however is lost in mark peploe director and writer diluted version of heyst without properly establishing the crucial details of heyst character all that is left of conrad main character is very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement on the one hand actualizing the subtext is mammoth task though not impossible but on the other hand dafoe flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism in the end we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another the final transformation while perceptible lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad novel its absence in the film is unforgivable the film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers alma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship namely heyst underlying philosophy of detachment which heyst himself grapples with the struggle against heyst ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma love for him jacob fair skinned gentle and yet passionate handles the role with precision detailing nuances where possible unfortunately she is let down by superficial script the couple relationship develops too hastily leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with blatant show and tell approach all we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone this is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried thoughts and emotions the sketchy handling of their relationship stands out as sorely as dafoe american accent an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london the other characters such as schomberg jean yanne the owner of hotel and mr jones sam neill also fall short of conrad meticulous characterization while schomberg should have been more menacing and vindictive mr jones should have been portrayed as something more of an enigma sam neil caricature of slightly stout effeminate and soft spoken gentleman at large ifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as an insolent spectre on leave from hades endowed with skin and bones and subtle power of terror poor characterization aside kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo secretary to mr jones reckless ruffian capable of murder sewell with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity masterminding deceitful plans behind jones back at the same time we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans despite the authentic setting and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer very few images are left behind for us to savour after the film has ended sourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have their charm but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence of an epic which is what victory deserves to be the delicately inter woven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate production at the end of the film we are told that perhaps alma victory was in teaching heyst how to love hollow victory indeed the flying inkpot rating system wait for the video little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
couple of criminals mario van peebles and loretta devine move into rich family house in hopes of conning them out of their jewels however someone else steals the jewels before they are able to get to them writer mario van peebles delivers clever script with several unexpected plot twists but director mario van peebles undermines his own high points with haphazard camera work editing and pacing it felt as though the film should have been wrapping up at the hour mark but alas there was still 35 more minutes to go daniel baldwin can believe about to type this gives the best performance in the film outshining the other talented members of the cast [r]
chill factor is carbon copy of speed with one notable exception instead of speeding bus we now have an ice cream truck the truck is driven by arlo cuba gooding jr and mason skeet ulrich who have been instructed by dying scientist to transport deadly chemical weapon to military base by the name of fort mcgruder this particular weapon nicknamed `elvis must be kept below temperature of 50 degrees or else the shockwave will goo iffy everything in mile radius that would be pretty nasty the power of elvis is revealed in the opening scene as dr richard long david paymer conducts test on an isolated tropical island long accidentally melts 18 soldiers and defoliates virtually the entire island due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance the commanding officer general brynner peter firth is sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of his troops upon his release the general is intent on tracking the good doctor down snatching elvis and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder protecting the fate of the world is drifting hamburger flipper ulrich and feisty ice cream delivery man gooding jr who must elude brynner men and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder all the while of course they must keep the weapon below 50 degrees this proves to be tricky among the wild adventures arlo and mason partake in is trip down tree covered mountainside in boat and fist fight on top of moving vehicle they also crack few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing to put it simply ll use clever pun chill factor should be put on ice director hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed broken arrow and the lethal weapon series to create lifelessly bland cocktail of chase movie when there is some occasional action the audience seems oddly detached from it perhaps that because we ve already waded through pool of clich and boring dialogue all material that been used before and with lot more spice take the villains for example they are typical stereotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen they speak lines that have been recycled profusely from one movie to the next divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint and act in very predictable ways the tag team of gooding jr and ulrich sounds much more exciting than it is frankly not sure can accept cuba as an ice cream man suppose it better than him dressed like giant hot dog selling jumbo frankfurters on street corner gooding displays one single emotion in this movie which is frequently on display in lines like `i gonna get on yo ass like last year underwear and the incessant sputtering of `oh sh this is virtually the same character he played in jerry maguire and as good as it gets but where gooding was once an exciting actor he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous at least he bit more captivating than ulrich who has all the film worst dialogue but does nothing noticeable to enliven his character the supporting cast which includes every personality you expect to pop up is also wasted to be fair there are few brief moments of serviceable action and did chuckle few times one example is when ulrich an employee at `darlene diner is at the counter when brynner walks through the door `you own this place the general asks `yeah ulrich says `they call me darlene these little tidbits of humor are mainly welcome in this weak disappointing wreckage of an action film as speed clone it could have benefited from lot more suspense and perhaps god forbid even some decent writing sadly walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could have been
warning the following review contains spoilers cast gary sinise don cheadle connie nielsen jerry connell kim delaney tim robbins elise neal jill teed jody thompson bill timoney written by jim thomas john thomas and graham yost directed by brian depalma running time 115 minutes the first big event movie of 2000 turns out to be anything but gary sinise stars as an astronaut who is removed from mars mission when his astronaut wife maggie kim delaney becomes ill and passes away don cheadle is then given the mission along with russian couple and young hotshot when strange whirlwind shot from the top of mars mountain range attacks the crew of the mission sinise and robbins convince their superior to let them neilsen and connell perform rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaining what they discover on the surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected before ever saw the film was aware of the promotional campaign with dr pepper every time would see bottle of the soft drink the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it little did know that the plot would be taking back seat to the product placement of the drink and several other products dr pepper saves the day at one point and dream sequence flashback features jerry connell shoving m&m in our face these are but couple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film clich are also the order of the day with mission to mars dialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style even independence day which lifted all of it premises from other sci fi films was better than this film and don like independence day films like 2001 space odyssey the abyss and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from and poorly at that there is even sequence where rover is traveling through canyon and couldn help but whisper tinni to myself and wait for jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get glimpse of it this film also features one of my all time least favorite movie clich the he would have wanted you to have this moment where one character gives another trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on scenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films but in film as clich ridden as this it is particularly irritating ennio morricone music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on but here it is dreadfully overbearing his music sounds like it came straight out of vincent price movie in certain scenes at other times his music is unbearably over dramatic one sequence involving daring spacewalk rescue is given particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won reach its intended target mission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme events are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience we are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife but felt extreme boredom coupled with twinge of disinterest what makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins character needs to turn himself into popsicle except to invoke an emotional response could think of at least one way to save him and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be smarter than am during the finale when we are finally introduced to the translucent conehead kitty faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn brief history lesson about where we came from is proffered then sinise is whisked away to be with the rest of our people he does this because his late wife proclaims in video he watches early on that this is chance to step foot where no one else has >from the press ve been seeing this film receive it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying quick death at the theater sure the first weekend or two will be huge but once word gets out people will stop going let just hope the upcoming kirmizi planet is better than this and isn hurt by the negativity this film is generating venture to say it won be worse than this waste of time [pg]
retrospective city of the living dead 1980 film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as dim witted and by golly just about all other words fail me when confronted with dog like city of the living dead although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career this is not one of them two points in the movie favour the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi keep things from falling totally into the abyss but by and large city of the living dead is failure and like most cinematic failures it comes down to bad writing dumb performances and lousy direction the story starts in new york when during seance medium katherine mccoll sees vision of priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich massachusetts for reasons we won go into here this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by crusty old journalist christopher george that scene in itself is howler why would you bust open coffin with large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside and don cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they re buried anyway off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world where various grisly goings on are already happening as all saints day approaches fulci graphic gore is in evidence once again but here it only serves to further highlight the film flimsy script and plodding direction the dialogue in all manner of speaking is unspeakable not bad in the quotable sense like an ed wood film but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious lets explain the plot type approach mccoll doesn have clue who her character is deadly serious one minute frivolous the next she at times is genuinely hard to watch and the geezer the actor name escapes me who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses christopher george performance is salvageable but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by zombie and we don care in fact we don care for anyone in city of the living dead though in other fulci films that hasn mattered so much when he was on form as stylist and an ideas man as he was in the beyond as director some of fulci idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here he constantly uses extreme close ups of people eyes ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors aren capable of and despite some gruesome violence he barely manages single scare in the entire film long time collaborator fabio frizzi talented but always erratic offers patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electro pop that quite frankly embarrassing fulci other films of this period may be flawed house by the cemetery the beyond the siyah cat but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey for completists only
you know the plot dimwit with shady past is seduced into committing crime only to be double crossed by fatal femme in palmetto the dimwit is harry barber woody harrelson reporter who just been released from prison he was framed by the gangsters and corrupt officials he was investigating enter la femme rhea malroux elisabeth shue the sexy young wife of the richest man in palmetto florida rolf hoppe she and her stepdaughter odette chlo sevigny have plot to extort 500k from the old man harry will kidnap odette after groping both women harry agrees as everyone except harry can see he being set up as fall guy sure enough before long harry has dead body in his trunk and the cops on his tail his brother in law tom wright an assistant da has hired harry to be the press liaison for the case so harry gets front row seat for his own manhunt and we get to watch him sweat literally there are several plot twists of course couple of them even took me by surprise apparently every woman in palmetto is raving horndog and they re on harry like he the only bone in the kennel shue vamps so broadly that expected tex avery wolf to show up her incredible performance in leaving las vegas seems to have been fluke here she could easily be mistaken for melanie griffith shue character is supposed to be savvy schemer but she comes off as brainless bimbo in addition to shue and sevigny the kennel includes gina gershon who filled the dimwit with shady past role in bound as harry girlfriend nina when harry gets out of jail she licks his face now there horndog the parts are so overplayed that with little push palmetto could have been an over the top parody of film noir la romeo is bleeding as it is it best watched at 2am on showtime the love scenes seem to have been written for one of that channel soft porn programs anyway palmetto has well known director volker schl ndorff who best known for his adaptations of major literary works especially the tin drum suppose he must have been drawn to this plot by numbers script by the same admiration for classic film noir that led scorsese to remake cape fear schl ndorff tries hard he makes an interesting motif out of the ubiquitous palmetto bugs but nothing can freshen up this stale script
the comet disaster flick is disaster alright directed by tony scott top gun it tells the story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on collision course with earth and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble jeez after great opening in which an american spaceship plus the city of new york are completely destroyed by comet shower nasa detects the said asteroid and go into frenzy they hire the world best oil driller bruce willis and send him and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem that like sending mouse into cat carrier isn it the action in armageddon are so over the top nonstop and too ludicrous for words had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook couple of times was not alone plus to see wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is film like armageddon is waste of the actor talents the film is just reel to show off bunch of snazzy fx shots the only real reason for making this film was to somehow out perform deep impact producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon
years ago robin williams made _jumanji_ brilliant achievement in special effects but travesty on nearly every other level the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ boring illogical weepie wannabe that left my senses numb don get me wrong love breathtaking special effects and pulse pounding imagery _brazil_ is on my personal top ten _the city of lost children_ is great film because of its outlandish scenarios even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ being in the minority amidst my friends _what dreams may come_ imagery aside has little daring thought to complement its imagery the daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized it idea of plot is so lukewarm that it insults the bigger questions it raises it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences put on an electronica soundtrack and sell it as one of those popular _mind eye_ videos robin williams plays chris nielsen who dies too prematurely not only in the story but before we have chance to really know and care for him the director vincent ward and the screenwriter ronald bass have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife big mistake it would have been far better to take the half hour or so needed to tell his life story first ala _it wonderful life_ so that can build up respect for him so could know and possibly care for him his children and his long suffering wife played superbly by annabella sciorra instead the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses it doesn so in the afterlife chris learns that people still don meet god that our thoughts are reality and time does not exist there hmm i+ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative the not meeting god part still irks at me but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect that said this alternate reality still makes no possible sense read on chris wife commits suicide since suicides go to hell chris would be separated from his wife forever the important question is is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love good question and like good thought provoking questions don+t like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question _loathe_ it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes popular rescue film especially rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously _really_ loathe it when it+s story is no longer run by logic but by special effects hey chris did you forget your thoughts are _real_ they are more _real_ than the physical world according to the new age screenplay so why don+t you conjure up positive thoughts of annie and let that run wild and then she would appear before you and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity because there would be no movie that+s why and albert the angel played by miscast cuba gooding jr says bluntly that+s fantasy umm if your thoughts are more real than the physical then fantasy is not fantasy but real surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that and if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person and that your thoughts aren big enough to sustain you for eternity well in all due respect that why don subscribe to this theology all due respect another idea based on time pause does not exist here so chris spend your eternity with annie as she is on earth reliving your favorite memories or hang out with her when she was growing up you+ve got eternity perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out and forcing her to write still exist in her diary imo is just too tacky there are many other ideas all of which are hundred times better than what+s unraveled in the plot the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before and just come out stale most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects so when they finally show themselves he realizes they were with him all along and when this happens the film runs in slow motion as if to build emotion _gag me with spoon_ so the only things for me to like are sciorra+s effective performance who rises far above this mundane material and the special effects please note that while enjoyed some of the visuals did not enjoy _all_ of them some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe everybody floating up and down in invisible strings it sounds like joke but it+s really true really tried to block out the dialogue and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack my vote goes to rare cd called never say die 1981 from petra christian rock group it+s pretty good and they have song about annie who commits suicide it+s too late for annie she+s gone away for good there+s so much we have told her and now we wish we could but it+s too late melancholic yes depressing yes but far more entertaining so in case you don+t know let me be straight suicide bad _don+t do it_ no no no got it you shouldn+t have to pay $7 50 to hear this in an awful robin williams schmaltzfest
the original _babe_ was my favorite movie of 1995 sleeper hit that transcended its target audience being surprise commercial and critical success it had no marketing tie ins which limited its final take thus babe arrives with budget greater than the money made in babe plush dolls vending machines hawking shirts and macy thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money grubbing too late this is sad review to write because babe not only does _not_ live up to the original but it doesn even come to fraction of it shouldn expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors magic but this film tries too hard and loses its charm consider driver applying the accelerator with great intensity unaware that his car is in neutral imagine with me if you will _scream_ jamie kennedy explaining the rules for sequels like babe there must be _more_ talking animals there must be _more_ slapstick comedy there must be _more_ songs for those mice to sing that cute keep the story cards to break up the action that cute too even though the pig gets wise made no sense given the context of that story partition there must be action however illogical that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to the baa ram ewe secret code the that ll do pig that ll do now throw in the limitations james cromwell now hot commodity has limited time on the set or maybe he didn approve of the script christine cavanaugh the voice of the original babe demands more money $200 000 paltry considering the $80 million budget out daily comes in with noticable results george miller the director is more well known for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment not for kiddie fare and no he didn direct that _andre_ film in 94 the special effects are impressive _but limited_ babe talks but most of the time from single shot repeated over and over again babe is center screen looking straight into the camera with happy smirk regardless of whether he happy or scared or tired season now with the original elements which as we will find out are straight from the screenwriting is hell bin change the venue into the big city this has been praised as wildly original excuse me didn _home alone_ do this several years ago how about the muppets even _the bad news bears_ travelled to tokyo sorry no dice side note to give the city fairy tale look george miller crafted fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the world great cities and yes it _is_ impressive but this too is over used repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions and for the most part babe _remains in the hotel_ ii given the limitations of cromwell the human element is taken over by the boss wife played by magda szubanski she not lead actress type she not funny enough in her physical comedy and she simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls have her arrested falsely on drug charges have her accidentally incite riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes have her bounce around on bungee cord at prestigious benefit dinner was hoping for little smirk during these scenes but felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film the violence the scene where pit bull dangles from the bridge head submerged underwater even the best fairy tales have bit of the macabre in it as the brothers grimm have demonstrated no my problem is with the story or lack thereof _babe_ is sent out to save the hoggett farm but once in the city that story is forgotten being good natured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice but other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull what did babe actually _do_ without giving the ending away the farm is saved from left field quirk that had nothing to do with the pig speaking of pig or pig pig pig pig pig the word pig is so overused had they changed it to an expletive and had the pig be al pacino could have been watching _scarface_ this is screenwriting further cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups had it been cartoon and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd maybe my reaction would have been softened but to farmer hoggett his wife an elderly mickey rooney much too irreverent quick splice those singing mice into those scenes the film isn colossal failure did like glenne headley schmoozy chimpanzee liked the pink poodle the dog on the cart who momentarily thinks he in dog heaven and weird looking guy who may have been doubly cast as an airport employee and judge but most of the time was looking down in boredom or in embarrassment over the hacked up script them singing mice those chapter partitions the proficient acting of the animals none of these can compensate for story let me spoil the final scene farmer hoggett looks at pig proud says that ll do pig that ll do that it hope didn ruin it for you but tell me this what the heck did that pig _do_
at first was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer but that was before saw the film now my view has completely changed it time to embrace for impact because this is very bumpy ride the story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including jason nesmith tim allen alexander dane alan rickman gwen demarco sigourney weaver signing autographs at convention they meet fans who dress up in costumes fans who worship the ground they walk on and group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris robin sachs of course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties and meet the ugly aliens themselves thus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians the movie plays like really bad star trek episode in fact it worse don even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof because quite frankly it just not funny all the jokes are basically collected observations from the series one such continuous joke involves simple crew member who believes he will die in space because no extra on the tv show ever lives as proven in the star trek series creative jokes like this may seem like clever idea but not when they are used to death person can only take so much we do not need to be tortured especially when you have to pay for it it pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful it not like expected an oscar worthy performance form him but few laughs would have been helpful speaking of acting fine talents were wasted as well sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage well at least it worked it pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage it just shows you how disgraceful the film really is alan rickman however was not so lucky after his last hit dogma he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess it just shame to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away when the film couldn get any worse thankfully some nice special effects pop up like many big blockbusters armageddon the haunting to name few they rely heavily on effects to help boost the film box office results times it works but unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk when will it stop am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash it may look fine and dandy but we need to at least have story is that too much to ask obviously it is when galaxy quest finally ends it literally crash lands aside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic it an embarrassment to the cast and it embarrassing to the science fiction genre it not the least bit fun nor was it entertaining the only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond
phaedra cinema the distributor of such never heard of classics as soft toilet seats trailer the movie and the one armed boxer vs the flying guillotine has sneaked its latest release the sculptress into few theaters this weekend hoping to cash in on handful of halloween holidaygoers looking for right good scare the sculptress is scary proposition all right but not in the way its producers intended from the outset it easy to see why some of the larger more reputable chains aren carrying it the film looks like straight to video release from the early 80s that been dusted off not very carefully and re issued in theatrical format that staple of schlocky movies jeff fahey the lawnmower man plays washed up shakespearean actor lacking in some basic people skills when he not reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment screaming scotch induced hamlet soliloquies well into the night he out and about on the streets of san francisco stalking loose women fahey dobie sizes up his victims actually just one peep show performer name of sylvie dressed like one of the guys from kraftwerk and approaches them in the ridiculous attire of bavarian count replete with cane dark glasses and false beard just in time for halloween do you have castle sylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallet outside coffee shop jah with ze many turrets is dobie perplexing reply the real star of the film and use that term extremely loosely is katie wright who plays the sculptress of the title sarah is new in town studying at the prestigious sf art institute under the mentorship of genius frenchman played by the beret wearing patrick bauchau that convenient because sarah would one day like to live and work in paris you won believe the film final shot with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop and rosemary baby inspired imagery bauchau character criticizes sarah work publicly her clay busts keep turning into gargoyles perhaps she possessed by an incubus but he still manages to talk her into dinner whereas wright does decent english accent her talents pretty much end there on the other side of the wall dobie troubled past is succinctly summarized in scene in which he thumbs through an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like actor delivers stunning macbeth actor courted by hollywood studio actor renounces hollywood for priesthood and prostitute fingers priest in sex scandal the film plot could have been just as easily condensed artist moves in next door to shakespearean psychopath yawns ensue so dobie rants and raves and sarah chips away at large blocks of granite till way past their bedtimes late in the film their paths finally cross with mind numbing results nobody else in the apartment complex appears to mind all the racket but one old dear does go ballistic when sarah bathtub overflows no we don see wright in the tub or fahey for that matter and the gore quotient is virtually nil so for horror film the sculptress is surprisingly lacking the only thing worth looking at is san francisco and writer director ian merrick manages to make even it look dreary windswept and deserted the sculptress isn even bad enough to be fun luckily limited release has made it easy to avoid
here is movie that sadly follows the hong kong recipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter these kinds of movies are marked by an eye opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters life and death plot in which these characters become involved the inclusion of host of inconsequential characters ridiculous subplots and sunglass wearing henchmen that is not to say that don like hong kong influenced movies however it is quite obvious that these moviemakers haven clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hip hop talking thugs and stupid sight gags observe the opening sequence band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment led by melvin mark wahlberg and cisco lou diamond phillips they are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles however their partner is unsure of which cable to cut he is undecided this happens for about 10 seconds the audience finds some humor in his foolishness the lights suddenly go out cisco is surprised and says whoa let go and they storm the apartment in very nicely executed sequence the big hit of the title refers to kidnapping that happens quarter of the way through the film needing cash cisco devises plan to kidnap the daughter china chow of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi however the daughter is also the god daughter of paris avery brooks who is cisco and melvin boss infuriated and insufferable paris commands cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping during his investigation cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader and paris orders his capture and execution melvin must now find way to stay alive by the way do you know how the investigation takes place cisco partner makes the ransom phone call believing that his call will not be traced because of trace buster that prevents tracing but mr nishi has trace buster buster to counter that cisco partner has trace buster buster buster but nishi has trace buster buster buster buster and so on there is no doubt that this is an interesting world in which they live and there are lots of issues that we like to know more about how does melvin justify his profession to his fiancee what goes on among this clique why is cisco at odds with melvin there is actually lot of potential material that could have been explored but it seems that no effort is made to go in that direction and instead we are given not so engrossing plot filled with one liners silly sight gags extraneous sub plots and tomfoolery and haven even mentioned his financee visiting parents who want them to separate nor melvin mistress nor the pimple faced video clerk demanding the return of an overdue video and on and on and on if the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences then shoot me now
after the huge success of the exorcist in 1973 sequel was inevitable and sadly like most horror fims that make money the filmmakers decided to make ridiculous sequel that makes absolutely no sense at all and to me was extremely pointless wasting linda blair and max von sydow completely needless dumb sequel flopped in the box office and never gained much success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time to which agree with to start the story it is four years later and regan is being tormented by memories of what used to be now priest played by richard burton is trying to figure out why this demon tried to possess regan and now the demon somehow wants to possess her again maybe she was good or something now they must try to stop this demon from taking over regan body before it is too late some of the bad things exorcist ii has in it is linda blair she had no need to revive her character and she is really terrible in this film she brings it down to lull and in places it seems like it just stops in its place and doesn go anywhere louise fletcher is alright for what it worth but she could have done lot better than this the direction by john boorman is that of confused stylish nature that really couldn figure out in fact had no idea what was going on in this film the script was jumbled the plot was jumbled and the ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad for those exorcist fans who haven seen this one recommend renting it actually gave this one high rating if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins went easy on it however because of the fact that it has bit of good direction but nothing else im not saying like the film now so dont start going anywhere bad bad bad movie
the people who populate the movie 54 are shallow self absorbed and self indulgent in other words they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts 54 is the story of that well publicized new york disco studio 54 the in place in the 70s where anybody who was anybody went to be ogled photographed and pampered the difficulty with 54 which was written and directed by mark christopher is that his script takes no point of view christopher neither condemns nor glorifies the legendary excesses that were studio 54 hallmark he keeps an uninvolved distance thus keeping us from forming any emotional attachment with any of the protagonists the movie one main asset is the surprising performance by mike myers as steve rubell the famous owner of the nightspot he is part rebel part dreamer part shrewd entrepreneur he smart enough and childlike enough to pander to the dreams and desires of his clientele yet stupid enough to brag on tv about hiding profits from the irs myers in his first straight character part is in turn appealing and appalling at one moment he can try to pressure male employee into sexual situation then at the next moment apologize for his bad behavior and offer the young man handful of cash the story is told by shane shea ryan phillippe new jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to the big apple shades of john travolta brooklyn bound tony in saturday night fever eventually shane does come to new york attracts rubell eye and is admitted to the promised land his looks get him job as busboy and he is later promoted to the prestigious position of bartender where he mixes with and makes drinks for the rich and famous shane dream is to meet soap star julie siyah neve campbell fellow garden stater but both characters are so sketchily drawn that even when they do hook up it no big deal the chemistry between shane and julie is nonexistent 54 is very cold uninvolving movie it all strobe lights and glitz all substance it sort of like the musical era it covers
ve always been kevin kline fan silverado fish called wanda pirates of penzance and even his hamlet on pbs great performances the minute saw the trailer for this film resolved to see it besides the fact that kline starred it looked like hilarious film got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent however as also thought wow if there this much funny stuff in the trailer there must be ton of laughs in the rest of the film oops packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo my name for our local multi multi plex the film began the film concerns an english drama teacher at suburban high school named howard brackett he loves poetry and great literary works but his class is more interested in his famous former student played by matt dillon put in his name but my wife won let me take notes during movie and ve forgotten it they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him brackett has been engaged to another teacher played by joan cusack for three years and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her the wedding however becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is homosexual kline spends most of the first two thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference his closest friends don help matters bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party there are some genuinely hilarous moments one involving tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity kline is hounded by gay reporter played by tom selleck who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations the movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding kline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows if you want to be surprised don read am going to reveal the ending instead of saying do in front of his parents and most of the town and even some cameras he says gay this is where the movie in my opinion falls apart most of the humor in the film had come from kline insistence that he was straight while at the same time loving poetry and being senstivie guy dressing well and occaisionally acting prissy it reminded me of the effeminate heterosexual sketch from saturday night live it was funny it was sustainably funny and kline performance made it doubly so however after the wedding the film drags on they should have attempted to come to quick conclusion but it then gets into the serious side of what he done he reconciles with his parents and his friends some of which had turned on him there are several scenes which seemed like waste of time the scene with his mother and her friends which was hilarious seemed pointless and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless finally even though am not catholic found the scene with the priest to be condescending the preist cannot believe that man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship proclaiming to brackett in the third person he gay it got chuckle from the audience but was distracted by it and began to tire of the film by the time the wedding had come and gone found myself hoping it would be over soon much like this review you are saying overall if have to quantify it say rising action gets and climax and falling action gets see it in economy time
call hush stop or my mom will kill or mommy fearest or the hand that robs the cradle call it whatever you want but certainly don see it unless you re in desperate need of bad movie induced chuckle hush scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as guilty pleasure chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post production tinkering it was supposed to open about year ago the latter of which appears to have given hush send off that downright infuriating it too bad that hush is so laughable because the on screen talent including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange is nothing to laugh at paltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson photogenic new york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy well to do family horse farm estate kilronan jackson mother martha lange runs kilronan all by herself and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether caught red handed after bedroom romp with her husband to be but it seems that martha friendly smile masks much more threatening demeanor she what you call someone who loves too much martha eagerly deviously wants grandchild and then helen will be expendable as far as she concerned if there one reason to catch hush it lange she treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated injecting martha poorly written though she may be with little empathy to level out the psycho playing field when she delves into martha dark side predictable cliches chain smoking staring in mirrors praying in confessional to priest who isn there poking hole in helen diaphragm so she ll become pregnant and she does abound but it moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch veteran performer nina foch is smart and tart as jackson wheelchair bound paternal grandmother the rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable especially paltrow but can you really blame them the character relationships in hush hold certain amount of promise at least until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity idiotic situations martha yells at nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock helen over compliment idiotic dialogue why did you yell helen yells back at martha and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blank from hell flicks ever made you can see through great deal of martha actions and lies from their conception why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out does nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town if any of her potential victims thought acted or behaved like normal people hush would be really short movie and then there the climax and ending which abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with labor inducing drug normally used on horses after really weird chase scene martha calmly knits in rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in bed all by herself won spoil what happens next except to say that it contradictory illogical and probably since no doctor medically impossible the final scene offers no closure no resolution no confrontation whatsoever it just there dangling amidst silent displeasure no one should like this ending regardless of their feelings on the preceding material perhaps hush title is plea to silence its audience likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater
big busy boxing satire with surprisingly paltry punch the great beyaz hype stars samuel jackson as shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay per view revenues is to invent beyaz contender peter berg to challenge his siyah heavyweight champ damon wayans the logic is that people will pay more to see siyah vs beyaz than siyah vs siyah he may be right in an absurdly accurate way but the film doesn give us reason to care as scathing sports spoof hype is just that unfunny unfocused and at times just plain pointless as commentary on race relations it even less effective the dialogue is the best of this mess lines like jon lovitz exclaiming cannot make caviar out of fish eggs writers tony hendra and ron shelton also do good on the street slang though we never hear enough of it the script isn strong enough though to support the aggressive camera work of director reginald hudlin house party he comes across as absolute overkill the great beyaz hype almost turns around at the end at the big match when hudlin attempts an extended gag of rock concert proportions with costumed dwarfs gangsta rappers and the champ dressed as death only then do we get glimpse of the spoof that should ve been
know there were times during this movie that laughed pretty hard the problem is can remember them as write this review that not good sign in booty call jamie foxx is bunz character whom can really describe because don know that much about him only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk and that he doesn like relationships just booty calls at three in the morning no questions no commitment bunz has best friend named rushon tommy davidson who seems to be bunz direct opposite on the straight and narrow and currently in long term commitment whole seven weeks wow rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend nikki tamala jones but for reason which is not totally explained it going to happen after double date with bunz and nikki friend lysterine vivica fox who have never met to make long story short the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki obsession with safe sex first she wants condoms so bunz and rushon go out and get them oh no they have to be latex not lambskin back to the store now they ve got to get dental dams or there ll be no foreplay why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes demand nikki phones lysterine who lives across the hall and tells her she better be making these demands too talk about coitus interruptus booty call is film that does not know whether it wants to be regular comedy or one of those over the top comedies the difference between the two is that in the latter things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality in this category for example you have ace ventura private eye on the mild side and airplane at the extreme there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention it is disappointing and even worse distracting there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker are those real names does not live up to its potential as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing for instance there is scene where our main characters are in chinese restaurant bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese much to everyone surprise however when asked how he learned the language he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late night kung fu films and soon gained mastery this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene if on the other hand when asked how he learned to speak chinese bunz simply replied with kung fu movies and then moved on the joke would have been much more effective this is because it would have been totally unbelievable but funny because we know it is unbelievable by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible the film is not giving its viewers enough credit the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex why doesn she have some condoms at her own apartment these questions are not answered by the screenplay but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language some movies use lot of swear words but use them under very justifiable circumstances as when they are employed consistent with character pattern of speech other films such as the recent jackie brown use them in ways that almost parody themselves booty call just sticks them in to get laughs and it doesn work they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason the chinese restaurant holdup at convenience store and trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story and are in there for filler this is surprising considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long it too bad that the core of the film isn much better since it is comprised of sometimes funny but forgettable dialog refer you to the first paragraph of this review
retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been popular trend this year earlier this may leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top rated miniseries that debuted on cbs and now director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies starring milla jovovich who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being witch `the messenger the story of joan of arc is disjointed and overblown historical re enactment that prevails merely as bloated mistreatment of the famous legend besson who previous work includes the hyperactive sci fi `the fifth element perhaps entrusted bit too much faith in ex wife jovovich because in `the messenger the actress is drowning in pool of her own inexperience at first when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such demanding role was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry film of such caliber after seeing the rousing trailer my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed milla jovovich looked superb with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance `the messenger looked like timeless epic in the making timeless epic it is not besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style and the story behind `the messenger is not entirely suited to his demands on the shoulders of besson choppy and unexciting direction the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery there is no human exploration into the character of joan or jeanne jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective jovivich unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as piece of spiritual cardboard she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast jovovich does have few isolated moments of sheer power but mainly she looks lost quite frankly don know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger without major fumble the script is chock full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii john malkovich and informs him of her heavenly intentions faye dunaway plays charles overbearing mother in law and dustin hoffman appears over two hours into the story as character dubbed the conscience all three actors juggle limited screen time although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful the battle scenes are extremely bloody but with the presence of such jittery camera work they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like `braveheart there particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on when jeanne as young girl watches in horror from closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by bloodthirsty english soldier even his fellow troopers are petrified `the messenger is also strictly 90 update on the classic story almost too 90 it seems there gratuitous use of the word and barrage of slang terms like `she nuts sprinkled throughout the screenplay was half expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib but it never happened there also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly it seems terribly misplaced but in catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `the messenger almost everything does the musical score by erric serra is spectacular and the set and production designs are continuously impressive if it was visual excellence that besson was striving for then he achieves his goal but the only time the dramatics come alive in `the messenger is during the closing trial in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake during these moments the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience albeit in faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning it just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects `the messenger the story of joan of arc is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf anyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film despite my original hopefulness milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy
violence is bad violence is ugly violence breeds yet more violence kids don try this at home this weighty message isn the only barrier to enjoying brother but it certainly one of the largest written directed by and starring the infamous takeshi kitano kikujiro sonatine brother is his first film made outside his familial japan bringing the yakuza tradition to los angeles yakuza translated for the average american is the japanese mafia if you piss family member off or dishonor yourself in any way the usual punishment is public display of self mutilation usually resulting in the loss of limbs definition of dishonor can be anything from making stupid decision to leaving one family for another it would be interesting to know more about where these and other customs come from unfortunately the film doesn give too much of an explanation assuming its audience is aware of kitano earlier work there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members leading one to assume they would be symbolic of something but you never know what then there scene in which man kills himself in front of rival in exchange for that rival joining the family granted this is one of the best scenes in the movie but it doesn make lot of sense instead the two hours are basically spent watching the following people go out and shoot each other talk about it for ten plus minutes then go out and do it again the consistently repetitive discussion of territory during these moments involuntarily provokes yawning there are also plot details thrown in for no identifiable purpose all of the sudden yamamoto kitano has girlfriend he barely speaks to her treats her like crap and then sends her away another missed opportunity considering it is such big deal for kitano to bring his magic to the united states is the combination of cultures which rely too heavily on overused stereotypes though slow moving brother does have good elements the action scenes are well directed clearly defined and interesting to watch some of the violence is more hinted at than shown which produces the luscious squirm that one goes to see such films for the actors would be more enticing if they had more to do shirase masaya kato loud sarcastic coolness set against yamamoto quietly threatening attitude is truly an entertaining combination their moments together or apart steal the rest of the show also to its credit brother tackles the cause and effect of crime with realism life of crime is easy to get sucked into with the first reward of quick cash sure people get rich but they can also lose just as easily it great moral with great cast just not much substance to back it up
there nothing quite like gory anime really and this is the truth no other genre in film gets away with such violence without word being said in the media about it with anime common shot is watching body getting quickly cut in two and the rest of the insides falling out seconds afterword this is standard practice in anime or at least the half dozen or so titles that ve seen vampire hunter is gory gory film if they ever made live version of the film it would be banned in several countries and given rating somewhere below xxx it not that it gore is unique it just like other gory animes but this one was supposed to stand out because of the complexity it story characters animation etc it really didn it was disgusting and gruesome which overshadowed the story what little of it there was it seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the world because god knows that our local police force just can seem to get handle on vampires in the movies one evening blond peasant girl drawn to look 17 and innocent foreshadow that we will see her naked guessed early on it would be in the shower or in rape scene is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of ten thousand year old vampire insert strom thurmand joke here of course he never put no trespassing sign on his yard so one can really blame her but he upset anyway and demands retribution she gets the obligatory bite on the neck aren there other places to get blood from it seems like bite in the elbow would do well enough if it good enough for doctors to draw blood from then why do vampires stray from that sight to fight the spell she enlists the help of mysteriously tall dark and handsome vampire hunter you guessed it his name is the vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires being attracted to the 17 year old peasant girl and finding reasons not to talk too much you see like all heroes in these kinds of stories he brooder who sole purpose in life is to remain really really silent when he speaks it in cliches heroes like this are bad when they re live even worse when animated later the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire who wants to marry the peasant girl because he bored after 10 000 years of living the only clever vampire insight made in the movie will vampire hunter rush to save her in time will we see blood and intestines spattering on every place imaginable in it defense the animation when focusing on being original rather than recycling anime slicing could at times be original the talking hand was clever and think the inspiration for skateboard related logo and that the best defense can think of understand that vampire hunter is supposed to be fave among anime fans but really don see it it an excuse to watch blood dripping from teeth blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks and most importantly like all violent anime it is an excuse to see animated breasts why what is the point of that maybe have to understand the genre and look past the obsessive gore and mysogny not prude just don think it warranted it puts itself so far out in front of the movie that everything else gets lost is there neccesity in seeing 17 year old in the shower of course not it done for shock it tasteless and despicable
lauded as genius by many stanley kubrick commands superlative filmography that includes such critically acclaimed films as 2001 space odyssey clockwork orange lolita and dr strangelove or how learned to stop worrying and love the bomb now sadly he added eyes wide shut to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first and only blot on his near flawless copybook kubrick alas should have quit while he was ahead this much publicized psycho sexual tease thon with its star billing of real life marrieds tom cruise and nicole kidman is nothing more than one long two and half hours long boring exercise that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut kubrick faithless to arthur schnitzler 1926 novella dream story has confused eroticism with nudity he has confused intellectualism with talking slowly he has confused profundity with pretentiousness in addition the director has made some strange casting choices leaving sydney pollack in and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel and jennifer jason leigh out pollack the director of such box office hits as tootsie and out of africa is normally solid in his occasional acting stints but here he miserably out of his depth and there isn much depth to begin with unhappily there not likely to be director cut of this film to determine whether the decision to exorcise keitel and leigh was the right one in fact with the exception of the stark black and white credits snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack and many many grainy tracking shots down lavishly decorated corridors there none of kubrick trademark brilliance in this film it doesn help that the story as delivered is ridiculous cruise and kidman who bring little more than marital torpor to the project play well to do new yorkers bill and alice harford he doctor and she an unemployed art gallery director and they share central park west address at an opulent party hosted by their friend victor ziegler pollack alice gets little tipsy and starts dancing with jeremy irons like hungarian who singularly determined to get her in the sack bill too is seen arm in arm with couple of models before he pulled away to deal with an overdoser back home bill and alice smoke little pot before alice aggressive jealousy kicks in as retribution she confesses to her husband that she once had deep feelings for naval officer she eyeballed at hotel where she and bill once stayed this hurtful admission sends bill into tailspin he pounds the streets of the village in his heavy siyah overcoat struggling with black and white images of alice in the grip of horny midshipman it all way too much for him for revenge bill almost has sex with hooker he almost has feelings for underage girl he sees in costume store then he almost does the hooker roommate and he almost involved in an overblown rococo orgy when an old college chum of his tips him off to mysterious password protected party where everyone wears masks and the women are incredible naked this erotic set piece cult ish bacchanal complete with chanting incense and lots of strategically placed partygoers covering up the dirty might impress the likes of hugh hefner but it lot less shocking than it intended to be what the big deal bill doesn exactly do anything other than throw his money and credentials around and alice only ever lusted in her heart whoop dee doo still they make up at the same agonizingly slow pace was kubrick notorious for multiple takes paying them at an hourly rate even geniuses have their bad days eyes wide shut just happens to be kubrick bad day an unerotic disappointing and altogether pointless end to an otherwise memorable career
by starring in amy heckerling clueless two summers ago alicia silverstone proved she wasn just another pretty pouty ingenue showing buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs namely stint as the aerosmith girl and silly turn as the lethal lolita of the crush out of the water her only work since that 1995 gem has been in june batman robin where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl now she the star and producer of excess baggage hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level silverstone emily hope is stuck with billionaire father jack thompson who neglects her emotionally in an outlandish plan to gain his affection she fakes her own kidnapping emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set pricey ransom ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw but before the police can rescue her professional auto thief vincent roche benicio del toro jimmies the locks hot wires the engine and makes off with both the car and emily who still trapped in the back when vincent discovers emily the two don exactly hit it off she annoys him he annoys her and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner harry connick jr he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there along the way of course they get into whole heap of trouble and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky felony studded situation it doesn help matters that emily and vincent are being trailed by cops crooks and even her shady uncle ray christopher walken who wise to his niece ploys for attention and has mafia connections for at least half hour excess baggage bounces along fast and efficiently during this time emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as nice role reversal twist she an awfully aggressive combative victim and he quite the aloof seemingly vulnerable captor but once it past its set up the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once road movie teen comedy mob thriller drama about family relationships you name the cliche and excess baggage likely covers its territory of course romance develops between the two leads but it all seems forced and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome do you like my tummy emily coos to vincent at one point in the film huh did miss something the hard edged foul mouthed grrrl is suddenly gone and replaced with pair of batting goo goo eyes then again excess baggage becomes so weak in so many areas that the personality transplant is not complete surprise supporting cast attempts to do what they can with colorful but empty secondary roles but the movie isn game enough to use them all and therefore seems overcrowded motivations keep shifting resulting in an often confusing narrative scant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions excess baggage has too many characters too much plot and juggles with one arm behind its back and remaining shaky hand loved silverstone turn in clueless as an aloof pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen emma looking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there it simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that had mustered for excess baggage sadly however excess baggage is no clueless but on the other hand it is clueless
because scientist that what we do dr alexander mccabe bob gunton in response to why he created evil bats alright folks stop me if you ve heard this one genetically altered animals wreak havoc on town and small band of locals assisted by specialist in the particular animal field must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth oh yeah the military is on their way to bomb the town as well so they are running short on time sound familiar such is the plot of the destination films release of bats dina meyer stars as the bat specialist sheila who is pulled from her research along with her annoying sidekick played with irritating deftness by leon in order to help small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently with the help of the local sheriff lou diamond phillips cdc official carlos jacott and scientist bob gunton sheila discovers it is indeed bats who have been genetically altered by gunton character to be more aggressive and omnivorous in order to be used as military weapon have to say here that knew exactly what was getting into going into this film there not frame of promotional footage have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good in this respect the film never disappointed me this film reaches level that transcends the so bad it good level and borders on the downright insane the effects are awful the script is contrived and for most of the feature was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously think challenge anyone to sit through the scene where bat stalks baby in crib while another bat terrorizes patron eating at diner with straight face thankfully the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in johnny mnemonic dragonheart and starship troopers the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit and this one is no exception while one never really gets the impression that meyer character could be bat expert in reality one never really cares to doubt it either she gives as good performance as could be expected plus she nice to look at for an hour and half lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what going on in town for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats the only bad performance in the film is that of leon he is relegated to the not sticking around here character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays anyone who can immediately tell that bob gunton the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised but highly doubt it even if he hadn been the villain in just about every film he ever been in so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever in fact his death is welcome because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale if the plot doesn sound ridiculous to you yet then check out these little tidbits multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when police officer cocks his pistol an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor orders to stay indoors after curfew is instigated causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force killing several townsfolk government official blows off shelia instructions to wait until dawn to install cooling unit in the bats cave that will kill all of them off by pulling night job resulting in the death of an entire military unit cavern full of bat feces never ignites when phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it finally to top it all off this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it single screen theater for reference our town has over million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens and we re lucky to even get kevin smith dogma the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill conceived bat puppets while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what going on the scenes where bat is called upon to interact with live actor are usually shot more low key therefore we the audience get loving close ups of the most unrealistic rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film being able to see the puppeteer arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse after all of this if you still decide bats might be the movie for you don say you haven been warned trust me when say that it lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in she definitely talent that is going to waste in films like these
the word to describe sharon stone is wonder not that she _is_ wonder but rather that wonder how she can be so inconsistent she has dynamic screen presence in basic instinct turns in surprisingly fine acting job in casino but possesses neither of those here stone teams up with private school headmaster wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani thoroughly unlikable husband chazz palminteri in comedy of errors and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock as in `homage to [read steal from it turns out that someone saw them or he not dead or maybe kathy bates turns in credible if unspectacular performance as an investigative police detective her character is bit dull but realistic although her actions at the end are puzzling adjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation it stone that is disappointment among the actors how can she be the epitome of femme fatale in previous films and come off as blank in this one costumed in skin tight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring not enticingly dangerous even the threat or promise of lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out on the positive side there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive that is if you can put up with stone cardboard cut out character and scenes directly lifted from hitch movies
the tagline on random hearts reads in perfect world they never would have met in perfect world never would have seen this movie the biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film kay chandler kristin scott thomas and dutch van den broeck harrison ford are the only two major characters alive resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two hours and then some production dutch is sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department kay is congresswoman from new hampshire although they both think they are happily married their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs dutch and kay are soon widowed when plane goes down carrying their partners they subsequently discover the affair the rest of the film is the pointless unrealistic and often times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to and getting to know each other in the process two sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film dutch is trying to arrest fellow officer task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare all the great stereotypes get pulled including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter kay distraction from the film primary focus is her campaign for re election and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on pedestal these sub plots could have made for semi interesting points but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother daughter relations in depth and consequently suffers random hearts two primary characters seem to live in shells although both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other there is plenty of opportunity dutch having partner and kay having close friends and her daughter but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships veteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack and critically acclaimed up and comer dylan baker both have cameo roles but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both other than its weak plot it is hard to criticize random hearts however it is also hard to compliment it had the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like well frosted cake rather than the dry one that equates to be
in double jeopardy the stakes are high think of the plot as rehash of sleeping with the enemy and then rearrange the details and the gender of the stalker the finished product although able to maintain the viewer attention is predictable and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script `alex ll take homicide for $400 libby parsons ashley judd is happily married mom leading normal life one night her husband nick bruce greenwood takes her out for romantic escape on sailboat libby awakens in the middle of the night to find she is covered in blood and nick has strangely disappeared she follows trail of bloody footprints up to the deck where she handles fallen knife like any stupid character and is spotted by the coast guard who are responding to distress signal sent earlier in the evening nick is presumed dead and although she pleads her innocence libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband now please don think spoiling any vital plot details because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans if you haven seen this preview don read any further but seriously the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg and douglas cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters during the most vital scenes in the movie was anticipating every twist or `surprise that eventually popped up on the screen imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is very naive group of individuals most unfortunately will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production one is tommy lee jones who plays travis lehman parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison jones is always wonderful as an authority figure and he certainly familiar with this sort of role as he played so well in the fugitive and us marshals judd as likable heroin with gusto also has chance to flex her acting abilities while emotionally unconvincing the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role perking up the movie like an injection of anti depressant the actors and their relationship together present the one two punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely and now back to the plot while behind bars libby learns an interesting little bit of information person can be convicted of the same crime twice this law called `double jeopardy could be her motive for hunting down her husband who may still be alive yes you heard right the movie degenerates into cross country chase where everything you expect to happen does the final scenes which could have redeemed the film are poorly handled by director bruce beresford whose previous work centers highly around drama driving miss daisy paradise road ironically it is those elements like the driving force of libby to reunite with her son that don quite work here at least double jeopardy is paced well enough to satisfy diehard fans of the two stars unfortunately jones lacks some of the edge that he had as sam gerard in the fugitive and the real depth of his character is only skin deep but he and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material and both have some memorable comic moments judd in particular has hilarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has to check in with her `parole officer hmmm perhaps this would have made good comedy it is disappointing because there are the makings of competent action film here it nicely shot and choreographed in downtown vancouver and will entertain those who aren turned off by the woeful story line tis shame that double jeopardy is an adult thriller that wouldn fool most children
synopsis melissa mentally disturbed woman who likes to smoke seduces doug minor league baseball player who likes to study anatomy work on motorcycles and make out with his girlfriend in public library when doug decides to stop seeing her melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him including his girlfriend his mother and his cat comments malicious suppose is an acceptable moview for what it is cheap movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurned psycho lover who wants revenge films like fatal attraction hand that rocks the cradle etc etc that have come before it malicious however really doesn provide very many particularly suspenseful moments the plot starts off energetically enough the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film it starts to drag unfortunately after this melissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug as always seems to happen in movies like these but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other better thrillers before she drugs someone she kills family pet and leaves it in the girlfriend apartment and of course she stalks so we see number of shots which are supposed to be suspenseful where she spying on doug and his girlfriend won reveal the ludicrous ending to this turkey but warn you that it both painfully obvious and real yawner john vernon does remarkably good job at playing the not so bright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa one of the script faults is to try to pass off character like this as pre med student the same cannot be said though for molly ringwald at times she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine especially during her silent going to stare you down scenes at other times however she just seems somehow goofy and out of place in one particular scene which guess was supposed to be suspenseful she screeches you you and throws phone she delivers the line so ridiculously that one can help but laugh malicious certainly isn the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there but it isn all that good or original either feel free to treat this film maliciously watch something else
warner brothers rated pg 13 mild violence sexual situations 132 minutes director luis mandoki screenplay gerald di pego from the novel by nicholas sparks cast kevin costner robin wright penn paul newman illeana douglas robbie coltrane jesse james john savage review by geoff berkshire not an overly cynical guy there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years however have my limits and also have standards this brings us to the subject at hand message in bottle the big ticket romance that warner brothers unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine day the story what little of it that there is involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne robin wright penn dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason jesse james during brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in bottle while on morning run by the ocean the letter written to mystery woman named catherine instantly captivates her upon her return theresa shares it with her best friend lina illeana douglas her boss charlie robbie coltrane and the entire city of chicago the newspaper publishes an article about it it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake kevin costner and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down he turns out to have colorful father paul newman but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship of course she doesn tell him that she found his letter she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later preferably right after they first make love this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened the discovery of the message and garret discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and quarter hour running time of this film there truly lame subplot about garret relationship with his dead wife family he gets into bar fight with her brother played by john savage and then the necessary tear jerking ending fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced and unintentionally humorous sequences filmed since well since costner the postman 1997 message in bottle is one slow moving film last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe siyah but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work message in bottle has decent enough cast but they re fighting the material all the way and losing badly costner and especially wright penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry the supporting players are given very little to do the reliable douglas is particularly wasted old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of film confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played however too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story gabriel yared who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient 1996 and city of angels 1998 with his scores overdoes it bit here caleb deschanel camera makes everything look little too beautiful do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times the real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego working from best selling novel by nicholas sparks which have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times its strict adherence to clich brings to mind such disasters as still know what you did last summer 1998 there simply isn an original scene in this film the dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking this is director mandoki first film since when man loves woman 1994 the solid meg ryan andy garcia romance he simply going through the motions with this message in bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come 1998 as one of the most misguided romances of the decade
running time approximately 1hr 40mins reviewed by jack choo rating the movie starts with rather se7en ish opening sequence rather cool and sets the mood for things to come the story propels the audience into neo reality somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of mavi and kirmizi existenz is actually the name of new virtual reality game supposedly vr games are highly popular as is considered legal drug in this neo reality leigh is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate game experience in the form of existenz players are required to have bio ports embedded in their spine which plugs to game pod in order to enjoy the immersive experience during secretive beta testing cum teaser meeting for this new game an assassination attempt on life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard law is more of realists than anything else afraid that he ll lose reality if he begin to play these games but requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt as they soon discover they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected existenz has all the cronenberg gore that is expected of him even so this film is no where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners not even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly existenz can probably be looked upon as his 90 version of videodrome even so it is poor follow up while in most of his famed films his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot in existenz the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of over indulgence than anything else jennifer jason leigh and jude law both commendable actors looked aloof and miss directed throughout the entire film the scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the grade category it was obvious that cronenberg worked on really tight budget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film the opening sequence though probably formed considerable portion of the budget which is actually quite good existenz is too predictable and cliched in these times 10 years ago it would have been another classic for cronenberg cronenberg fans however those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film should not give this film miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you
in china in 1982 turned the tables on our national guide and asked him if he had any questions about america guess was expecting some sort of political question instead was dumfounded by what was most on his mind in america do wives and their mothers in law get along well he assured me in china that they did but am certain if that were true he would not have asked even in china people seem to have problems relating to in laws perhaps some of life most difficult relationships arise when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage man trying to relate to his new prospective in laws and vice versa could be the basis of very strong comedy meet the parents does not demonstrate that fact however greg focker played by ben stiller has been dating and in love with pam byrnes teri polo for ten months and is now ready to propose to her he will do it during weekend visit to meet debbie family and to attend her sister wedding from the beginning the relationship is awkward between greg and jack and dina byrnes robert deniro and blythe danner through no fault of his own the airline has lost greg luggage and he has to ask to borrow clothing it is the beginning of game of one upmanship in which greg is nearly always one down as the games go on greg is more and more uncomfortable and uneasy which only contributes to the mistakes he makes greg is playing game he does not understand in league he is new to but perhaps along the way he will discover some unexpected secrets about his father in law this film had potential in its tale of one upmanship it has hit on situation that many in the audience may find familiar one that has not been done overly frequently in films but the script by jim herzfeld and john hamburg is little too contrived too many coincidences in the story work against greg the script could not decide if the main character was incompetent or simply unlucky certainly he does not help his situation by doing everything wrong he possibly could but even when he is trying to do the right things nature conspires against him there is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written the main reason to see meet the parents is to see robert deniro performance deniro plays the suspicious and not little fascistic father as tightly wound and threatening as he can the little judgmental expressions on his face are show in themselves as greg digs himself deeper and deeper into his insecurities but we do not really see much of that digging ben stiller is an affable presence in the film but is not really stretching himself by playing the role as the nebbish to whom so many bad things happen it is nice to see blythe danner again on the screen but her character has basic conflict between basic decency and her love for her husband and the script should have given her more to do with that randy newman has written playful score in the first few seconds of the film it does something creative have never heard film score do before there is lot of source music that is popular music of the 1960s presumably that is what the upper class listens to at least in somebody imagination humor is subjective and some this film has been getting some favorable comment but this is comedy that works only occasionally for me would have to rate it on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale
the fab of ronald reagan high are four stuck up girls played by rose mcgowan rebecca gayheart julie benz and charlotte roldan who overdress like posh spice wannabes their daily ritual is to parade up and down the school halls like royalty and their constant reflex action is to grab their compacts so they can check their make up and powder their cheeks under no circumstances will they ever let themselves be seen eating in public in writer and director darren stein jawbreaker it isn as funny as it sounds in fact it isn funny at all stein has taken the siyah comedy of teen movie like heathers and stripped it of any intelligence wit or charm his actresses toss off their lines so fast that they don have time to add any emotion and all of his female characters have considerably more lipstick than brains the setup for the movie has one of the fab liz who is referred to as the princess di of reagan high be killed when prank by the other goes wrong the princess di reference is in bad taste as is much of the movie granted bad taste can sometimes be funny but the mere presence of bad taste doesn guarantee it liz girlfriends stick jawbreaker that is literally larger than golf ball in her mouth tape her mouth shut and stick her bound body in the trunk of car when they open the trunk later liz is dead they eventually put her mavi and bruised body into sexual position and make it look like liz was the victim of brutal rape these realistic and disgusting scenes of dead seminude teen have pornographic feeling that is hard to forget and will likely turn the stomach of many viewer the film dialog not only isn funny it trite one nerdy young girl introduces herself with my name is fern mayo as in hold the mayo when fern discovers what has happened the fab make her an offer she can refuse make up they cake it on her and welcome her to the clan the parents in the movie brag about learning parenting skills from watching oprah the teachers fare no better especially in the ridiculous lines they are given miss shayne please cover your bosom one young teacher who has been made up to look old and ugly says without any conviction this is learning institution not brothel besides the obvious question of why this movie was ever made there is one other question that like to ask the director why do you have phone number start with 555 if you going to cover the rest of the number anyway in cameo pam grier plays detective vera cruz who investigates liz murder as she interrogates the other people she stares at them like they are all idiots proving that she is the only one that gets it am sure that if the hard nosed detective cruz were to see this movie she walk out after about minutes and you be well advised to do the same if you should happen to find yourself in theater showing it jawbreaker runs 27 it is rated for violence gore profanity and sex would advise everyone to avoid it but if teenagers go they should be older and mature

have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series if there will there way and believe that anything no matter how great or revered can be effectively improved upon this is the reason that responded so well to gus van sant universally panned update of psycho thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience but also very on par with an original but do have big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad you see the point of remake is or at least it should be to iron out the original flaws and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection but what if the source material on which the remake is based isn any good to begin with that is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner the mod squad ve only seen couple episodes of the late 60s tv series on which it is based and to be honest didn like it all that much it has concept that and still is interesting group of corrupt young adults all in their early 20s are given choice they either go to jail for the various crimes that they all have committed or they can become undercover cops helping the police get into places that they normally wouldn be able to access obviously all opt for the latter option and become undercover policemen and policewomen the three main characters here are played by claire danes omar epps and giovanni ribisi of the three only danes has real character ribisi dumbass 20 year old is played exclusively for laughs epps slightly more intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes when the squad superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death the three of them sure that their beloved master was framed go off and investigate on their own discovering corrupt cops lots and lots of expensive whores and very lucrative drug operations all kinds of good stuff the only times that the mod squad comes even close to working is in its comedic moments although ribisi is trite actor and his characters repeat movie after movie his man here is really rather amusing when the script gives him chance epps straight man is effectively played against ribisi clueless spontaneity but the rest of the film is dull boring and singularly uninteresting drug op action plot is no longer anything new not even with teenage action heroes and the way it executed here it also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful claire danes character has potential but it is buried under heaps of cliches and her performance is too restrained she could have been tour de force but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role epps and ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected although their characters aren nearly as rich as danes could have been the mod squad is mind numbing marketing plot of film and teens will jump all over it it full of bad dialogue scenes and concepts that make no sense and get this drug dealers that like to tango with other guys in their spare time nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for claire danes is no longer alluring mainly because she got horrible hairdo so that draw is out there are however cool explosions guns and chases which may lure viewer into thinking that he or she is about to experience an exciting thriller of some sort do not be fooled some may call this escapist fare call it escape as quickly as you can fare
when the mediums in question are video game and feature film has there ever been respective here to there transformation that achieved any ground higher than noodle headed mediocrity super mario bros street fighter and mortal kombat were silly stinkers all and now the empty execrable wing commander joins their lowly ranks enduring this spectacularly bad bit of sci fi easily the worst of its kind is like watching someone futz around with video game for 100 minutes that is to say there little fun to be had when you re not the one holding the joystick the movie then is missed opportunity for director chris roberts who created the original groundbreaking pc incarnation of wing commander back in 1990 how an interactive brainchild so revered could end up such cinematic pile of junk under the helm of the same guy is head scratcher wing commander story credited to roberts and screenwriter kevin droney is clueless chaos melding incoherent narrative and unoriginal ideas it rips off the finest films of its genre top gun and in one scene even those spiffy stereoscopic freeze gap commercials set in 2654 wing commander stars freddie prinze jr as daredevil cosmos cowboy who hopes to be great fighter pilot like his father before him along the way he plays kissy face with his stoic superior saffron burrows at the new galaxy hangout where he posted comes to terms with bigots who resent him for his pilgrim heritage don ask and goes on top secret mission involving the jump coordinates what no death star plans of nasty alien race known as the kilrathi or something like that given the immensely confusing activity it hard to tell on the other hand what easy to see is that wing commander is big old mess the lame dialogue strains filled with such original lines as don you die on me battle stations and repeated and frequently unanswered calls for medic action sequences fizzle the character conflict garners unintentional giggles the sole source of suspense here is what these kilrathi creeps look like as they re kept out of view until the concluding 15 minutes imagine bearded siamese cats crossed with something from 50s roger corman cheapie and you ve got good idea little but techno babble happens for an hour and then it as if wing commander tries to do too much at once when it appears as though the movie about to show signs of pulse it instead provides hilarious touch of human drama culminating with use for bulldozer that has probably never been seen in this kind of space camp before matthew lillard featured prominently in said sequence is cast as prinze hotshot partner and though the two are fine young actors recently paired in the hit she all that they re fighting more than otherworldly evil here rumor has it that wing commander was slated as later in the year release bumped up to capitalize off this hot casting coup as well as the premiere of the new star wars episode trailer but in my audience there were no females present to make goo goo eyes at prinze or lillard and many member exited after the much ballyhooed sneak peek since most cineplexes won be granting refunds to the latter contingency commander might rake in some dough but be warned the high wears off as soon as the coming attraction gives way to the feature presentation
it almost amusing to watch 21 year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potter follow up to 1997 the tango lesson the man who cried the gen actress with her cold stare and big siyah eyes has appeared in an impressive range of films but she doesn even come close to being the bold heroine the film set against the historical backdrop of world war requires her to be ricci whose character is shockingly silent and blank showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett quite an amusing sight to behold blanchett lola paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie is bold interesting and layered everything our heroine lacks co star of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy blanchett has good seven inches on ricci sports twice the makeup and dons flashy wardrobe the actress inhabits the role as she always so remarkably does with fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the film lead rather than her dull companion important historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film these landmarks serve as the film little conflict obviously the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues the man who cried has many aspirations none of which come full circle by the film close there are forced messages here and there go forward always go forward lola preaches to suzie there romance between suzie and fellow target of hitler nazis the gypsy cesar johnny depp who like ricci barely gets to speak lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it and at the core of all these devices lies suzie desire to travel to america where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago the film main problem is that potter isn skilled enough to tell the epic sized story of suzie the time period instability the conflicting social classes the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life serving as both writer and director potter throws in some of each but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any by the time the sigh inducing climax hits the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater the film falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely are we really meant to believe any of this could happen contrastingly in its moving final scene the man who cried strikes note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film although it apparent that potter can grasp what she reaches puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place ricci suzie is meant to be the film core from the extended flashback at the film beginning to the quickly drawn ending everything seen in the film in some way relates to her so why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals the character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble but not present enough for the film to be ricci the almost constant lack of flow and one note tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha vierny beautiful cinematography that renders the film various locations wonderfully also worthy of note are lindy hemming costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely and then there the music from minute one to minute ninety seven there hardly moment when the wavering skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music don undercut the action the notes stricken both overwhelm particularly john turturro portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio whose money and reputation catch lola interest and accompany oftentimes the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the film characters and reinforce that state potter obviously cares much about each and every musical note unfortunately the same effort isn given towards almost everything else

how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres isn there law or something this diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst mouse hunt takes the bare threads of plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill the plot for what its worth concerns two brothers nathan lane and an appalling lee evens who inherit poorly run string factory and seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father deciding to check out the long abandoned house they soon learn that it worth fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder but battling them at every turn is very smart mouse happy with his run down little abode and wanting it to stay that way the story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue terrible overacting and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury signifying nothing the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is hate that mouse oh cringe this is home alone all over again and ten times worse one touching scene early on is worth mentioning we follow the mouse through maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift abode somewhere in wall he jumps into tiny bed pulls up makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep seemingly happy and just wanting to be left alone it magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film message to speilberg if you want dreamworks to be associated with some kind of artistic credibility then either give all concerned in mouse hunt swift kick up the arse or hire yourself some decent writers and directors this kind of rubbish will just not do at all
miramax disinvited on line media from press screenings of scream they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler filled reviews and post them prior to the film february 4th release date unsound reasoning you see net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionals miramax surely knows the difference between member of the on line film critics society ofcs and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain it cool news no the mini major was afraid we let bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit that scream is dismal conclusion to the beloved by this writer at least franchise something smells rotten in the state of california right from the get go cotton weary liev schrieber the former lover and would be killer of maureen prescott sidney mother is juggling phone calls in his luxury car once considered danger to society weary now hosts his own talk show 100% cotton clever if dated jab at american pop culture of course new ghostface dials him up and with memories of scream unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind we immediately wonder where is the killer the backseat the next car thrilling prospects to be sure but actually ghostface is at the weary residence waiting for cotton girlfriend kelly rutheford to finishing showering what missing from this sequence and indeed scream remaining frights most disappointingly the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes one of which might spring to life is an elaborate and attenuated payoff our other surviving regulars have become estranged sidney campbell is living paranoid existence of electronic gates and password protected locks while dewey arquette acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream movie within movie stab and gale weathers cox arquette headlines gossipy news program murder reunites them as knife wielding ghostface stalks the set of stab imitating its sadistic screenplay and his her their own personal draft climaxes with sidney death the appeal of ghostface villainy is that he she they could be your boyfriend your classmate your next door neighbour or combination of people scream was the first of its kind slasher mystery with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next but also who is are the perpetrator and what is are his her their motive ironic self reflection aside parts one and two stand out in crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume with scream the novelty of ghostface ever mutating identity has worn off some but the character remains conceptually potent conceptually the execution of ghostface master plan this time around is creaky because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we come to understand in scream and scream the movie gets in the silly habit of saying all bets are off in reference to the rules of trilogy third act but there difference between rule breaking and cheating with the departure of kevin williamson who authored the previous screams as well as tidy outline for scream that for reasons incomprehensible to me was ignored save the notion of stab kruger needed to be reined in tighter and by wes craven craven direction of scream is lazy in most respects how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo the slacker duo of kevin smith movies akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny it pains me to write this but scream comedy is generally laughless with the exception of well timed performances by josh pais as police detective possessed of the same personality he had as persnickety teacher in craven music of the heart jamie kennedy resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream and parker posey through sheer force of will as actress the visuals are much weaker in part three as well the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming camera is pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before aside in the wake of columbine craven toned down the violence significantly for scream why the sanctimony when scream and scream are still readily available on video store shelves finally marco beltrami music cues the suspense too blatantly do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream it mostly silent sting notes are whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere here they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve jangling score look at scream as coming from an alternative universe the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii woefully out of synch with its prequels scream is nightmare instead of nightmarish and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of trilogy to part three must disappoint
backdrop of new year eve in 1981 would seem to lend itself to great party movie the decor possibilities are endless disco balls had yet to migrate into the dark corners of the attic big hair was worth its weight in aquanet and the louder the fashion the better the look but despite this setting these details and soundtrack that includes some 40 plus irresistible hits from the early days of the me decade something is inherently wrong with 200 cigarettes better title for this nostalgic mess would be 50 missed opportunities what is it that makes this retro comedy such downer it certainly not the cast which includes enough hot young talent for several movies there courtney love cementing her reputation as serious actress christina ricci hot off her shoulda been nominated turn in the opposite of sex paul rudd who gets even more appealing with every role kate hudson inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn and affleck brothers ben and casey two of the best things about good will hunting perhaps the question is this what drew these and other immensely talented actors to such dreary project maybe it looked good on paper 200 cigarettes is composed of series of vignettes as various characters make their way through new york festively decorated east village to holiday bash thrown by jittery bundle of nerves named monica martha plimpton all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper among the potential guests are likeable cad kevin rudd and his best friend lucy love busy bickering over his recent break up and clumsy but seemingly charming bartender ben affleck who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pick up lines more subplots _many_ more dot the big picture but those listed above are the only ones worth noting in positive light all the other story tangents are as frazzled as cokehead trying to solve rubick cube ricci and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants out to have high time in the big city infamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to several scene cameo hudson as pretty in pink klutz recently devirginized by reprehensible ladies man jay mohr trips pukes and gets smeared with dog poop are we laughing yet the film boils down to mixture of the good the bad and the gaudy with the latter two overtaking the former game performances especially by love rudd and plimpton are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts and constantly roving focus here combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle too many sidetracks rate as uninteresting and have little payoff until lengthy final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one night stands for each other if this is 200 cigarettes then get me 200 nicotine patches
the premise of the new james wong film final destination is that alex browning the protagonist prevents six of his friends from boarding doomed airplane thereby cheating fate however fate is not so easily bested and alex friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances essentially this premise is clever way to make slasher flick without the slasher unfortunately this is practically the only clever thing about the film as far as teen horror flicks go final destination is better than many there is enough shocking death graphic gore and requisite siyah humor to provide the essential roller coaster type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick unfortunately this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre the relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set up the next death the scene where two of the characters break into funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue have witnessed if you are looking for saturday night thriller to scare your date this film might do the trick other than that wait until it goes into heavy rotation on cable
there is scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of courtroom surrounded by people who are giving him lively standing ovation because of his strong worded attack on group of stoic doctors when noticed that the audience with whom saw this film was reacting the same way realized that was going to have hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture you see patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries hated this movie for every second that sat watching it and actively hate it now days later with the simpering superficial nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories hate every element of the film beginning with tom shadyac shameless direction and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey the badness of patch adams is stupefying it confounding can believe film can be this bad and yet it based on real man who probably has good point to make in the film patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams in performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that wonder now if he is even human in the beginning of the film patch commits himself to mental institution because he doesn want to kill himself while there he notices that the doctors don care about the patients and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings so patch goes on crusade to be great doctor who actually talks to his patients he goes to medical school where he meets truman daniel london and convinces him that it good to help people he also meets carin fischer monica potters the anti male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be successful doctor naturally the dean of the medical school bob gunton hates patch and wants to thwart his plans even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams so patch decides that he going to build free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have and that my friends is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 on superficial level the film is not particularly bad wouldn say the cinematography bothered me and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for actually liked potter performance even if she is wasted but the film fails fundamentally in execution every scene swells with grand emotional music played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard take for instance the first scene which shows patch sitting on bus we don know patch yet but there sad music and it supposed to make us really sad that he sad later on patch makes lot of progress he helps dying patient peter coyote to enjoy the last days of his life and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively and when that patient finally dies spoiler alert the music is very very sad but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions real drama is character based you grow to like someone and then something bad happens and you feel it we don ever grow to know the dying patient he simply vehicle for patch greatness real drama doesn seem forced or present just to make the audience cry that why patch adams is not real drama it goes for every cheap tear imaginable wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman sickening musical score sentimentality like this is indeed bad but it not as bad as half baked simplistic themes you see patch is really great student he aces his tests without studying and does it so effectively that people think he cheating but patch doesn think that memorizing facts is the way to become good doctor why don we see patients until the third year he bursts out every three seconds well patch that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort most of us have to study and doctor who really wants to help but doesn know toe from finger probably won be too successful in preventing death oh wait almost forgot the point of doctors is not just to prevent death but to improve the quality of life yes that is true and you can not do that without studying you can not do that without going to medical school what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe just maybe it is good idea to study first and talk to patients later follow the rules bah who needs the rules only uptight doctors follow the rules the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big kirmizi spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants and then there the free clinic issue which find shockingly frighteningly idealistic free clinic in the middle of the forest where patients can be taken to be helped for free how will patients be transported to the free clinic will it have an emergency room or is it just for mental patients and who may ask will pay for it the film does give some token attempts to question patch motives think another character asks him how he going to pay for it in addition to little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance but they certainly don explore or challenge patch ideas to any meaningful extent reader please understand this am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams know nothing about him if his beliefs mirror those of this film character then might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them but regardless of what the real patch adams believes the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony and in the last scene the big obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus patch does lot of shouting actually robin williams does lot of shouting he shouts lot about helping people and lot of people cry because they are moved by his words won tell you that you can be moved by his words because too was moved by his words was moved in such profoundly negative way that was reminded of how cheap and phony cinematic experience can be patch adams is the cheapest of them all
have great idea for movie one that can miss see ve got coolio to do song for the soundtrack and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances it about professional basketball so ll release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity as for what the movie is actually about well that will all sort itself out eventually figure it will be comedy so ll throw half dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with maybe we ll put gender spin on it see if we can get some women out to see it too eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind twister as inane as the script might have been at least required some creative technicians mission impossible overwrought plot and all at least involved genuine effort eddie just sits there hawking up formula story without any laughs and makes every possible bad decision when decision is required whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin new york limo driver and die hard knicks fan who is suffering through dismal season for her beloved team coach john bailey dennis farina has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas and the losses are beginning to mount the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess frank langella to try publicity stunt in which lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team the winner surprise surprise is eddie who becomes fan favorite and eventually the actual coach the knicks continue to lose but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops incidentally the knicks eventually start winning please raise your hand if that comes as shock and will invite you to my all night marathon of the bad news bears major league angels in the outfield the mighty ducks the big green cool runnings and little giants awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds it what they do those teams usually involve kids for very sound comedic reason it funnier when they screw up and they re more sympathetic those which _don t_ involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles for another very sound comedic reason they generally have developed some sort of comic timing eddie was cast under the misguided premise that it easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players this finds nba players like greg ostertag dwayne schintzius rick fox and malik sealy delivering punch lines as though they were reading them for the first time off bazooka wrapper though sacramento kings center olden polynice has nice moment describing siyah hole to fellow players perhaps that all didn matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving flag of surrender and screaming don blame me just work here perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn movie it cameo appearance that trips over plot every once in while among the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump new york mayor rudolph giulianni former new york mayor ed koch david letterman letterman regulars mujibur rahman and sirajul islam espn broadcaster chris berman and knicks announcer marv albert as well as dozens of nba players and several nba arenas and those are the real jokes in eddie nothing these individuals say or do is funny you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice hey it donald trump or hey it mujibur and sirajul it difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can even get the cliches in cliche ridden genre script right the knicks coach who is eddie antagonist early in the film reappears at the end but he isn given chance to be the villain eddie desperately needs neither is frank langella and none of the athlete actors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of that leaves her to do her street wise miss thang routine but with no character no sharp lines and no help eddie isn just bad movie with formulaic premise it movie that makes you feel cheated and offended because someone came up with poster and marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be comedy
staring george clooney arnold schwarzenegger chris donnell and uma thurman with alicia silverstone well to start this off just like to say couple things first is miss michael keaton miss tim burton and would much prefer to think that these last two batman films are all like dallas dream sequence not even from the first film was batman really the star though he was damn close in the first couple anyway in batman forever and now in batman robin he almost pushed to being bit player can really say if clooney who regardless was better than kilmer was very good batman or not he given next to nothing to do at all he might as well not have been there and it wouldn have made much difference now joel schumacher has said that he refuses to bend to the masses that have hated his films and cheered for the return of buton that he wont make batman brooding and dark fine mean granted batman returns while being an awsome film was bit to dark sometimes yet his bright neon campy style is just killing anything this series meant to me usually very easy on films loved con air and other films some critics have slammed granted that film really was paper thin cliche ridden except for one thing it was fun there is virtually no fun in this film at all couldn have cared less it ll thrill the little ones as theres no violence really none everyone comes out fine in the end like those old tv shows where it ends with everyone laughing schwarzenegger is awful mean really really bad and this is coming from regular fan of his work love his movies most of the time and the basic reason is he never says much in any of them he talks all to often in this movie would have much prefered to have seen patric stewart in the roll believe to truely like film you have to care about at least someone in film liked alfred but the reason behind it is cheap shot
even though have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor his presence in motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality like everyone else dreyfuss has bills to pay so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies consequently while his career highlights include jaws close encounters of the third kind stakeout and tin men his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador let it ride and now krippendorf tribe let me start out by saying that krippendorf tribe is occasionally funny although never riotously so but that about its only asset the best word to describe this film is asinine the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes which are aimed at someone going through puberty krippendorf tribe tries to be zany off the wall comedy but the film makers have forgotten three important rules the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist the second is that viewers should be able to identify with or at least care about character or two finally and most importantly more than 5% of the jokes have to work once upon time james krippendorf dreyfuss was respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college he and his wife obtained grant to seek out lost tribe somewhere in the wilds of new guinea goal which they never accomplished shortly after their return from the failed trip krippendorf wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children shelly natasha lyonne mickey gregory smith and edmund carl michael linder on his own now over year later the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf which he has spent not on research but on things for his family so they send new member of their faculty professor veronica micelli jenna elfman to inform him that he has been scheduled to give lecture on his findings when he arrives at the college for the momentous event rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds he fabricates tale about mythical lost tribe the shelmikedmu to provide video footage he films his children dressed in native garb soon much to krippendorf surprise the shelmikedmu are national phenomenon but one disaffected professor lily tomlin is determined to prove that the tribe is fraud the only way krippendorf tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters not to mention the viewers are dumber than dirt unfortunately it impossible to like or sympathize with bunch of putzes like this director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than device to implement various dubious gags meanwhile attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend come across as feeble and derivative the acting in underwhelming dreyfuss has definitely not given his all to the role of james krippendorf alongside him jenna elfman the spunky co star of tv dharma and greg radiates perkiness and little else this quality while fine for 22 minute television program quickly becomes irritating in the arena of feature length movie no one in the supporting cast lily tomlin david ogden stiers natasha lyonne woody allen daughter in everyone says love you excels know that movie in trouble when it half the length of titanic but seems much longer most of what comes on screen is generic sit com level material the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set if there any upside it that don see much box office support developing for this lame ill marketed miscue krippendorf tribe will quickly become extinct
movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting entertaining or convincing because of one fundamental reason movies are made by adults and not teenagers occasionally however films like say anything dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called teenagers can hardly wait however does not instead the writing directing team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich found in the teenage genre strip it completely of perception intelligence and wit and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences have ever been subjected to can hardly wait follows group of characters as they attend house party on the night of their high school graduation the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them there the average male protagonist preston ethan embry prom queen and cheerleader amanda jennifer love hewitt football star mike peter facinelli beyaz rapper wannabe kenny seth green computer geek william charlie korsmo and brainy outsider denise lauren ambrose couldn stand any of those characters whether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming yo gotta have sex tonight all could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film apparently can hardly wait is supposed to be comedy but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it not funny in all honesty elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour and when say forced mean it they should be strapped down to chair and have their eyes wedged open in similar fashion to alex in clockwork orange this is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour for instance can hardly wait features foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as am sex machine for some reason elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough eventually it will be funny if only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk now that funny
way of the gun is brimming with surprises some good most bad one of the good ones is ryan phillippe surprisingly halfway decent performance after the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like know what you did last summer he hinted at bit growth in last year cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark precisely when the screenplay made his character grow heart presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans and start bellyaching about how he fallen for his target it was dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film director could negotiate but he seems to be trying and that shouldn be overlooked or probably over praised seeing as how at this point he really isn required to do much but look pretty here phillippe has procured five day growth of beard his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his look here see glory it tough to believe pretty boy like phillippe as hard ass but his performance actually helps with the illusion unlike ben affleck puppy dog approach in reindeer games phillippe is believable and not too bad at that as for the plot well that one of the bad surprises phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic and not even remotely likeable criminals introduced to us in the parking lot of rave where they stupidly pick fight with about twenty people who hatch scheme to kidnap surrogate mother juliette lewis after overhearing that she carrying the baby of painter scott wilson very well connected wealthy man the kidnapping devolves into laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed but the anti heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man james caan and two scheming bodyguards taye diggs and nicky katt remain in pursuit directed by christopher mcquarrie the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles this one included way of the gun is hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity unlike phillipe mcquarrie doesn seem to be growing at all he fills his flick with sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies know ve seen before and worse it feels like it the film lacks even fresh approach like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey to its clich all of which are spewed before us in picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is it features characters living by code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have cup of coffee and pontificate on life philosophy etc didn like the bit much when it first appeared in heat here it even more self consciously dramatic usual suspects which also featured bunch of low lives that seemed to live by code they learned from the movies worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending nowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential thus nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret most amateurishly projected before they appear and it too has an ironic little twist at the end nothing earth shattering like in the usual suspects but admit didn see it coming and smiled however most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason or substance it just as overplotted as suspects and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters distinctive style or good script would be even the good stuff most of which involves james caan doing fine job feels odd and out of place in movie that thinks lines like karma is only justice with out the satisfaction are clever at one point caan laments need is the ultimate monkey line so inexplicable he might as well have said love is like hippo ass ve seen porno with better dialogue and some with better plot lines too but rarely has porn offered up such talented cast mean can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy caan slips into this role with seeming ease he could do this kind of soft spoken tough guy in coma but he manages to give his character depth and weariness benicio del torro is always welcome though here he plays it fairly straight rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage adopting brad pitt esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering speaking of pitt his ex juliette lewis is weak link either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness or waddling about like silly goose nicky katt was brilliant in brief role in the limey here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted he only kept around for his cold presence taye diggs has similar function cool as ever but never character though the guy has one helluva death scene for the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give hippo ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns it vaguely tarantino ish but in bad truth and consequences nm way with phillippe in one scene leaping into stupid rant about faggots migrating to los angeles you know the routine the final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at but those gun shots sure crack like thunder just the other day was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt like sound that emanated from harry fetishized smith and wesson oh how far we ve come
when critics attack seemingly well intentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as am about to do their opinions are often greeted with backlash of angry mails sometimes even mock death threats from those who suppose like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment even politicians tend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on good hearted films while praising filth like pulp fiction these [fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with] tend to forget that film critic job is to review the movie not the message however sweet and endearing that message may be thusly patch adams isn bad film because it about doctor who cares for his patients it bad film because it calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation similarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place though even doubt that stay tuned an explanation is forthcoming it still an unpleasantly maudlin mess the picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey with burn scared face and equally singed attitude who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world 12 year old trevor haley joel osmet disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother helen hunt comes up with the notion to pay it forward this entails person doing one good deed call it an uber favor for three others then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we re all living in frank capra movie meanwhile in parallel story weasely reporter jay mohr tracks the movement which has apparently begun to grow pay it forward has odd ideas about tone at certain points it hurls smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core it as if director mimi leder didn have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended and compromised out of fear that her film wasn gutsy enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for so the picture adds grit child molester propositions trevor homeless man returns to heroin after being saved character is knifed while doing good deed etc though it seems shallow incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn quite sure if it ready to buy into its own utopian blather pay it forward offers crowd pleasing elements for general audiences jay mohr umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball angie dickinson earthy alcoholic bag woman and the jive talking siyah hoodlum with heart of altin coming on the heals of the siyah god like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled this may just be the beginnings of brand new guilty beyaz liberal clich hurray for hollywood who actually calls the mohr character nigga and says things like can you feel me leave it to pay it forward to happily include little minstrel act for our further enjoyment maybe spike flick wasn so misguided after all these scenes feel as if they belong in dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you ll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings while the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is film that could make the world better place to me the final product has the oily feel of cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to hopeful audience it picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration with the main players all previous oscar winners or nominees given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns one scene in which slightly de glamed helen hunt de glamed here means that not only is she fashion victim [her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama] hunt hair is also natty and badly bleached verbally castigates spacey feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip spacey of course responds in his cultured monotone that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance maybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating though how can he not even when he emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by wry indifference the usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender in one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke and with said hand still on said mouth she actually begins convulsing dry heaving really then and not making this up she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in frenzied search for alcohol the scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as parody of hackneyed tv movie blow ups it all very theatrical especially hunt performance which feels like pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar pay it forward has the dubious distinction of being film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn get academy awards the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists even haley joel osemt the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections his acting has become broader less intimate it as if we can make out the little munchkin thoughts boy this outta floor em naturally osmet is made to play one of those only in the movies children martyr figure who cleans up after his mother lectures her on the ills of drinking and even fixes her up on date with his intellectual teacher never mind that the two couldn be more dissimilar his mother is trailer trash dopey and the teacher is one of those dennis miller ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind vast vocabulary nevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in scene that recalls parent trap ish cornball antics but oh how we love bright articulate self sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life they re so adorable of course the blame can all be hoisted onto the actors though with the exception of the little kid they probably should have known better instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er then went on to make two awful genre films in row the first being the peacemaker witless post cold war george clooney vehicle and deep impact one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth possible demise by crazed meteorite the first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich and complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of ticking time bomb complete with digital read out apparently present for an invisible audience deep impact has more in common with pay it forward it movie that treats earth impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be goner within days the film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching in pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like rebuttal see my movie isn as na ve as you might think she seems to be saying no it just horribly confused
where do begin okay how about with this starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in long time in fact it might even be the worst major release film to come out in years or even decade this is bad beyond belief would not suggest paying money to see this there good chance you ll regret it if you see it for free you could still want to walk out go right ahead the movie starts off with cheesy 90210 scenes set in the future world of buenos aires here we meet the group of horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious easy to despise with passion characters that have love triangles love rectangles and love hexagons screwing up their life before long they all go off and join the military primarily in the interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined they train they strut around nude for no reason whatsoever after an hour of making the audience scream in agony they start fighting bugs the big bugs look nice even though their design is only okay unfortunately the fights are boring since we want all of the characters dead anyway cue more agony then some characters have sex then some more die who cares cue more agony the movie ends the audience runs out to their cars vomits over the pavement and attempts to drive home unfortunately after that torture they can think straight don pay attention to the road and many are in ugly car wrecks you remember how batman robin was bad well batman robin kicked this movie sorry butt people starship troopers does not succeed as an action movie it does not succeed as drama it does not succeed as war movie it does not succeed as comedy it does not succeed as satire it does not succeed as parody it succeeds as being horrible terrible gut wrenchingly bad wanted to run away from that movie every minute but paid my money and owed it to others to see if the movie got any better so stayed it never got better frequently it did the impossible and got worse the movie as written acted directed and basically just feels as whole like it about on the mental maturity level of free willy the whole thing feels like movie that only three year olds could enjoy except for the ridiculously gratuitous blood and gore and pointless nudity it written for little children but children should definitely not go anywhere near it of course recommend the same for everyone don go anywhere near it verhoeven got streak going now his last movie was showgirls he seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop coming showgirls was failure but it appears that though it ll be lucky to make near its budget this movie will still do okay gross wise is it really all bad well no troopers has about four or five lines of dialouge short humorous scenes that are actually funny mostly from the do you want to know more commercials that pop up throughout the story promoting the joys of the joining the troopers so that adds up to about 30 seconds of entertainment and still about one hour 59 minutes and 30 seconds of miserable torture totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movie but do admit it so if you re willing to possibly put yourself through torture go ahead and see it and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it don know how anyone or any thing could love this movie but hey to each his own feel free to give it shot of course in the interest of saving your souls don recommend it but guess what alien resurrection comes out november 26th and having already seen some of it and having read the script assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away though opinion on starship troopers is reasonably split it ll be difficult to find someone that won like alien resurrection when they ve seen it this is possibly the year best intense action film or at least one of the best if you really want to see alien warfare that played out intelligently and seriously see alien resurrection please avoid this
adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy the wedding singer unfortunately that also has the effect of softening his edge he nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore not that it was much of one he certainly not helped here by rather frail plot the year is 1985 letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia adam sandler is nice guy robbie the titular wedding singer who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits robbie life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee linda angela featherstone leaves him at the altar however things are looking up when he meets julia drew barrymore waitress at the hall she the perfect woman but for one small flaw she engaged to be married to slick junk bond king glenn matthew glave so most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love and his attempts to stop the wedding as far as plots go it pretty thin and tired one to fill the gaps the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia from boy george to michael jackson from miami vice to dallas from the first cds to the last rubik cubes this film revels in all the minutiae and then there the music learning lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank and romy and michele high school reunion this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow as result most songs get maybe lyric or half but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives eyes the wedding singer vols and while the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring at least they distract you from the plot at least last year my best friend wedding stirred up the standard keep your true love from marrying someone else plot by making the rival nice person here glenn is such lowly rat of man that you never see what julia saw in him barrymore on the other hand is simply charming as julia which leaves us with adam sandler he at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades little such as when he has breakdown on stage during wedding reception when he in full nice guy mode he more pathetic than endearing the film boasts several cameos most notably by steve buscemi and jon lovitz but none of them work well at all buscemi role as drunken best man simply fails to be humorous lovitz on the other hand as rival wedding singer makes you long for his good old days on saturday night live where he was actually funny the only cameo which has some appeal is guest appearance by classic 80s rocker during the film finale surprisingly one of the only plot related scenes which actually works adam sandler still has some work to do before he can become dependable leading man while he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer the end result is no net gain
arriving in barrage of hype the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year however like the golden child although blair witch has made lot of money it not very good donahue williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make documentary about the blair witch myth the film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles although events start of normal they get weird pretty quickly while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on although an interesting premise the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than missed opportunity the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise most of the dialogue is ad libbed and still manages to sound like poor movie the script eventually degenerates into shouting matches with the word included lot to sound like students there are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur but then it back to the shouting and swearing which gets very tiresome very quickly if wanted to see three people get lost in the woods shout lot and swear go on scout camp but no the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this but not quite sure how the supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes with no music and no budget to work with the film has to depend on natural psychological scares which are sometimes well delivered sometimes not never really felt truly scared during any part of the film although there is small sense of fear underlying throughout the film however because the actors are so irritating the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying what the ck is that lot and mike giggling like loony there also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things the main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment and are hopelessly lost heather still insists on filming it all the film gives half hearted reason why she should want to do this but it isn very convincing also the students have no idea how to survive in the woods such as following large river flowing through the woods to civilisation there are also some parts where the amateur camcorder footage is obviously staged heather apology being major one the blair witch project in the end just fails to deliver suppose if you ve been lost camping before the film may deliver some chills but this is no use for the other 99% of the paying audience who haven been lost in the woods apart from the final minutes the film is mind boggingly unscary and the shouting matches get hideously dull the spook scenes are short and far between and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide although good idea it not executed well enough to be fun scary cinema experience it worrying fact when the website http www blairwitch com is better than the film
the army utilizes number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done one particular field manual is known as the fm 22 which among other things covers the practice of saluting under the saluting section is sub section which covers how salute is rendered by military work detail in the presence of superior officer the salute is rendered by the highest ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail in any event the salute is rendered only by the man or woman in charge rather than by the whole group almost at the very beginning of the general daughter we see general motorcade passing work detail everyone salutes it looked impressive but it just wasn right that little bit showed me that someone either didn do the appropriate research or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene in fact this would serve as metaphor for the rest of the picture as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to good movie what results is film that looks good but like that one scene just isn right the first fifteen minutes of the film is good example paul brenner john travolta is an agent for the army criminal investigation division undercover at georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale prior to the transaction the buyer gets whiff that brenner isn the unscrupulous supply sergeant he supposed to be and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living so ensues cat and mouse action sequence which ends like certain scene in raiders of the lost ark we ll just say that it involves propellers brenner then receives new orders when the commanding general daughter captain elisabeth campbell leslie stefanson is found naked bound and dead on one of the base training ranges he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill madeleine stowe to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder what want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary it gives no insight into brenner other than the fact that he little cocky does the arms subplot turn up later no so why add this extra running time to the film the answer it looked cool or how about the atmosphere the beginning of the general daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south thick trees dirt roads sultry colors over water all backed up with bayouesque music nice immersion in the setting but it soon doesn matter for when the film plot shifts over to the murder investigation so does the entire mood no attention is paid to the location of the story and the music is altered to fit very generic thriller theme did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making different movie instead of creating cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie as ve already mentioned an entire section of the film doesn jibe with the rest and the characterization only adds to the difficulty brenner who comes across as man with little respect for authority suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell james cromwell and utters some of the corniest yes sir ve ever heard he even delivers an emotion charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general daughter even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just couple of minutes previous sunhill who initially comes across as professional investigator utilizes couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information and even revels in her ingenuity both characters are protagonists but it hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place and in some cases simply unappealing could imagine that during filming west would shoot scene then take the actors aside and tell them let do it again but this time want more say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good in this film they overact in most of their scenes an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general aide colonel fowler swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention far cry from his days as linc in the mod squad can help but think he was acting from west direction couple of side characters including west point psychologist john beasly and young female private ariyan johnson make their scenes nearly impossible to bear the only two actors who seem to have escaped west influence are james woods who provides good performance as colonel moore elisabeth mentor at the psychological operations unit and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police woods relishes the role of man whose job is playing with people minds and does so without ever taking it over the top hutton just kind of hangs around but at least he wasn overacting haven read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based but ll bet more than few dollars that the story was better in book form the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished every time we re presented with some new aspect to the case west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it the most momentous discovery ever but the information is not used by the investigators at all instead when conclusions are drawn they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts but lucky guesses instead the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill letting them play game of twenty questions with the suspects then letting them guess who the killer was would ve been over in half hour the film finishes with sort of bookend featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning literally during the closing credits we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off they both seem kind of happy maybe they were driving away from simon west
don appreciate it when thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting when in fact it ludicrous in the case of the general daughter the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to certain point but at this juncture in the story the movie begins to fall apart like crumbling cookie this predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of it detailed flaws get past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent and you re likely to survive this entire movie travolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner who working undercover at military base when another situation arises the apparent rape and murder of young female officer leslie stefanson it turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell let the investigation begin with the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill played rather on the sidelines by madeleine stowe brenner uncovers what appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case things begin to get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore james woods former commanding officer of the deceased who has few secrets up his sleeve woods submits another scene stealing performance here as he oozes authority surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar with echoes of his supporting role in true crime in which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges he makes every moment believable here though the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta as the two send mindful knowing glares across the room there are many scenes such as this in the general daughter in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb director simon west con air shows watchful eye of delivering stylish looking thriller but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part of it the general daughter is more often than not predictable and unexciting mess it does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless dragging it heels all the way at mind numbing snails pace few brief action scenes marvelously handled in the editing department show that the movie could have delivered such more proficient package from director who does such great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts suggest west should stick with mindless rip roaring action features and attempt to avoid future projects like this still the movie is certainly not without it merits the acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast the performances range from commanding travolta to electric woods to stiff as board cromwell who doesn show off his real talents here madeleine stowe manages to hold her own for while but as the female lead in an action thriller she doesn pull through sufficiently one of the problems with the execution is that it very predictable >from minute one had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question the script even unwillingly points him out for us using familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end in all fairness we ve seen many of the devices used in the general daughter put to greater effect in other films the secrets behind the girl mysterious death are explained gradually but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly the general daughter is not terrible movie and it is involving enough to sustain viewer attention span for certain period of time but it just could have been so much better
at one point in this movie there is staging of an opera that goes completely wrong but one member of the crowd stands up and cheers thinking the performance was planned and applauding it for their efforts that dirty work in nutshell very different kind of movie this is not movie that can easily review the critic in me analyzes the structure plot acting characters and tells me this movie is terrible but the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than movie it one note concept mitch and sam need $50000 in order to bribe doctor to give their father heart transplant before other more needy patients realizing they are very good at revenge plots they open revenge for hire business eventually running afoul of rich businessman played by christopher macdonald who after roles in happy gilmore and veronica closet seems typcast in this role who sends them to destroy building that mitch learns is the home of his girlfriend grandmother thus leading them to plot against the rich businessman on the night of the grand opening of new opera house first the critic in me the plot is the standard poor guy vs evil rich guy device where the main character meets the girl of his dreams along the way here the catch none of the characters are sympathetic they re all selfish jerks who don care who they hurt in their attempts to do whatever they want the jokes are juvenile crude appealing to the worst elements in people there jokes about prostitutes the homeless beastiality anal sex there even subplot that developed it seems only to make jokes about infidelity and incest and loved watching it was huge fan of norm macdonald sarcastic to the point comedy on saturday night live and this movie is an hour and half of it norm macdonald takes joke strips it to the core and tells it like it is with dry wit like the scene were he and his friend are learning the ropes at new construction job the foreman goes over the basics which mitch and sam don understand how do they get out of it by admiting they lied on their resumes and don know thing about construction and surprise they get fired the characters are incredibly mean spirited there father who loud and obnoxious gambling addicted doctor played by chevy chase who tells sam of his father condition by saying if were gambling man put lot of money on death the businessman cole who always has his dog spunky and does who knows what with it and then there mitch and sam who thinking they can get $50000 by destroying building ponder how their actions would ruin the lives of the residents too bad we have to do it mitch says here movie where every joke that is executed as it is set up where you see every punchline coming where every spot profanity could be used and then is used at least the film is honest and makes no mistake that it is anything more than idiotic but at least it isn dull and it isn predictable and that the way it should be it sketch comedy and if you re fan of norm macdonald you ll love it the jokes are crude the characters are mean to the core the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn care if you don like norm macdonald or stupid movies then you probably won like this one the jokes are crude the characters are mean to the core the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn care so before seeing this one tune your mindset and prepare for slew of norm macdonald humor gay animal sex prison rape jokes uncaring characters and one last performance from chris farley the critic in me says but give it an just couldn stop laughing
to sum the entire film 54 up in one sentence it would be watch vh1 documentary instead 54 seems like someone brought william faulkner into 1978 brought him into studio 54 got him really drunk told him to write about it and then dumbed that down to be released to the public sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex drugs and disco the narrator shane shae ryan phillippe works as grease monkey in new jersey who of course on whim decides to go into new york and try to get into studio 54 phillippe gives passable performance which could have been made by any young attractive actor with six pack stomach he is let in by steve rubbell mike myers the infamous co owner of studio 54 because he is attractive he eventually becomes bus boy and then bartender you expected more didn you there isn the film builds up from nothing and becomes nothing as it climax isn that an apt word for studio 54 lands with thud the glitz of the club and perpetually semi clothed patrons are used in an to attempt to show the it glamour for much of its target audience college age to early thirties it attempts to show celebrities mixing with normal people this even fails since the only two celebs truly introduced are andy warhol and truman capote you can be sure that half of the audience hasn heard of them another quarter only know their names and the other quarter knew they were there already the humor if you can call it that is built on an eighty year old woman getting high and 70s references like john travolta and olivia newton john making us laugh at how stupid we were back then the best performance in the film is given by mike myers as the perpetually high sexually ambivlaent very new york steve rubell he seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive he looks like rubell and sounds just like him while giving subdued almost nostalgic performance when needed it reminds you of his saturday night live character linda richmond on coffee talk sans dress and wig the supporting cast of salma hayek breckin meyer and neve cambell are their only there to give added subplots which are introduced but lead absolutely nowhere the romance between phillippe and cambell as soap opera star is completely implausable the two share about half as much screen time as there are shots of the eighty year old hooked on amphetimenes hayek wanna be singer seems extremely forced and her husband greg meyer stands in as shane shae surrogate best friend the subplots seemed forced and seem like they have been added just to make sure the film was over an hour and half long overall 54 tried to give view of the brashness of the place where crack flowed like heroin which flowed like wine the film never leads to anything has no obserable point and covers up lack of real plot with veil of beautiful people in truth that reminded me of the eighies
an attempt at florida film noir palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels it slow moving uninvolving and plain just uninteresting harry barber woody harrelson is an ex newspaper man just out of jail after being framed for crime his luck hasn been the best but things are looking up when mysterious woman rhea malroux elisabeth shue approaches him with proposition she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter odette chloe sevigny pull off fake kidnapping scheme to get $500 000 out of her stingy but rich husband felix rolf hoppe at first all harry is expected to do is provide threatening voice on the phone and to collect the money of which he gets to keep 10% but as the deed is carried out things are not what they seem and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve film noir film but the effect never quite comes together it got the sultry florida heat seductive women and even curvier plot twists but the whole thing smells of paint by numbers sure the right ingredients are there but the end result is much too artificial lot of the problems lie with the script which though providing some genuine surprises is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations even the plot twists don seem to flow well with the rest of the story some of them for example come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed twist for example harry spontaneous job offer or the whole typewriter situation the characters are mostly lifeless played to type but not much more woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick headedness that it hard to even picture him as an ex journalist elisabeth shue vamps it up but doesn add anything special to the role chloe sevigny gives terrible performance trying to be sexy 17 year old but she just leaves bad taste in your mouth some of the supporting cast notably gina gershon and michael rapaport give stronger but in the end meaningless performances and to top it off the pacing of the film is much too slow as the movie grinds to halt you re given too much time to wonder why you re wasting it watching palmetto if you re in the mood for this type of movie you be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir
this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard the rock and roller is asked to carry the film as the action antihero of australian legend ned kelly the so called robin hood of the aussies but he fails to be convincing in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly the film opens to prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution then it goes to technicolor and ned is seen in what goes for flashback coming home from jail after year sentence to see his mom and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family this scene is set in 1871 in the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings as he sings shel silverstein lyrics which tells of ned hatred for the british rule and hope for ireland to be republic ned says debt must be paid as he hears voices from his dead father his class divided country and his conscience all telling him to get revenge so begins ned romp through australia outback seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered he begins by stealing horses after complaining about the unfair tax law on horses that stray which favors the rich landowners when he only 20 he forms gang causing him to hide the rest of his life from the police who put price on his head of two thousand pounds when ned mother clarissa kaye is jailed on false charge of abetting criminals and sentenced to years ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mother freedom when the authorities refuse the kelly brothers go on robbing rampage burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults and murdering some soldiers rampaging through the outback they gather sympathy among the poor and lower classes who don trust the traps police spoiler to follow in the next paragraph in the climax kelly and his gang plan to ambush train with british police but someone kelly trusted tips the police on the train and kelly is trapped in saloon and captured ned brothers commit suicide rather than be taken alive but kelly gang escapes as ned heroically has the police go after only him and his brothers as they become decoys this was flat presentation hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kelly call for justice jagger didn have prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson the story failed to focus on australia seemingly more british film than australian under richardson lackluster direction all jagger seemed to do was proclaim his innocence and vow revenge which soon became shrill cry if you want to see better film about ned kelly catch mad dog morgan 76 much truer and more daring version with dennis hopper giving much better characterization of ned kelly madness something this film could only do in ho hum manner
think we should as responsible citizens all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie he changing the cinema as we know it and for the worst would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments prologues epilogues etc the premise lawyer can lie for day ho ho normally movie made from this premise would be terrible mr carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable laughed once and was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing grinding doesn begin to describe it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that if you are normal person you leave feeling sick when it not trying to be funny it trying to be melodramatic but it just annoying stupid and sappy at best this movie is intended to make people laugh yes not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound but it fails on every possible level it fails to be funny it fails to be insightful it fails to be suspensful it fails to be fun they should pay people to see it it suceeds on one level it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles for having lived if you go in with the intention of coming out alive please make sure that you are overly fond of boob fart pimple and fat jokes otherwise you will go insane yes literally insane stark raving mad it is boring stupid melodramatic and in the end ugly reccemond it strongly to ed wood
the best thing in fact the only good thing can say about dark city is that it made me want to go see confidential again or go rent body heat to see william hurt do some real noir or even god help me palmetto alex proyas new movie screams atmosphere screamed too get me out of this theater new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors and doesn have any way to get it back paid $4 25 for matinee screening and don have any way to get my money back either you ll hear lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create stunning nightmarish future world where it always late night in 1948 complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras ve got news for you fellows don care how hard you worked or how visually stunning this movie looks you wasted your time and mine working on movie without plot without clear sense of direction of where it wanted to go without soul or reason to care the movie starts out oh so promising john murdoch rufus sewell is lying in bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life would have been boarded up long ago there is dead mutilated prostitute in the other room surprise as he has lost his memory the phone rings it sinister sounding man claiming to be his doctor telling him to flee for his life all well and good right wrong apparently someone decided that the audience was just bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot this is getting to be popular assumption in hollywood so the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life rather it voice over narration by the aforementioned doctor keifer sutherland explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible it as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca no wait that not fair to casablanca it more like watching new plotline at the first of the show or if you want to know how really feel having an off screen narrator explain that gilligan won be getting off the island in this episode >from here the coherence of the plot goes down faster than insert monica lewinsky joke here the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason and that what moves the plot what we re left with is string of unanswered questions that don make any sense we re given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed we re given hero who can tune into these same powers yet he only uses them when it convenient to the plot we re given whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere usually critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part isn given much to do in this movie no one is given anything to do sewell is given the impossible role of man who doesn remember anything and plays it like um man who doesn remember anything the aliens are tall pasty faced and bald and wear long siyah cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they re evil and there child alien as well straight out of an anne rice novel sutherland is saddled with limp twitchy eye and breathy accent to remind us that he in league with the aliens to its credit dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting william hurt is perfectly cast as the world weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city jennifer connelly playing sewell love interest is given two all too brief moments on screen as lounge singer and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit but instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script the way they would be in any self respecting noir movie they re almost tangiential to the plot such as it is the problem with dark city is this it bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir the essence of film noir isn as proyas seems to beleive breathy dialogue or snap brim fedoras or tall bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in corner dark city has not one bit of intrigue moral ambiguity suspense or anything else that keeps us coming back to the noir classics dark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic it an exceptionlly well made and intricately designed piece of flotsam sailing around and around the middle of the ocean going nowhere
you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year they re obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big box office holiday season combine that with howie long first starring action role and you ve got doozy of movie that while not as bad as it could have been isn very good film howie stars as an ace smokejumper firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground in the slightly contrived opening scenes we witness his heroism in action as he and his mentor played by scott glenn attempt to rescue small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire william forsythe plays the bad guy mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak he and five convict cohorts manages to get selected for firefighting duty when woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby his escape plan bets lot on the laxity of the guards but since there must be movie luck is with him soon the now escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters why canadian who knows eh along the way they pick up pretty birdwatcher suzy amis to be their hostage enter howie long he called in to help fight the blaze and when he spots the group of ground pounders apparently lost he parachutes in to help when he discovers their true identity he is the only thing standing between them and escape and the only hope of help for the hostage long acting talents are above those of say steven seagal but not by much although his delivery is mostly flat and wooden he likeable hero and there are some hints here and there that he may get better the script doesn help him out any however all too often it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny the dialogue is strictly movie material and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable long co stars are mixed bag at least they re all comfortable in their respective roles forsythe has the scenery chewing villain down cold down cold and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch even when he doesn seem to be stretching his talents as is definitely the case here suzy amis plays peril pretty well but isn given much more to do some of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting but many are rather bland you think that the director dean semler former cinematographer would at least produce film with interesting visuals that not the case there lack of originality to nearly all the sequences we ve seen this stuff before it not the most auspicious start to 1998 but it could have been worse just think back to 1996 debut bio dome however after month of oscar caliber pictures movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were in fact there good chance that some of them are still playing near you
synopsis easily angered chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five years after their divorce diedre easily cons david not so bright new wife molly into believing she child psychologist so that she can influence molly and david quick tempered son michael diedre at the same time murders bunch of people comments the ex is very bad movie haven seen turkey of this magnitude in quite while kept vacillating however between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ultimately decided to split the difference and give it two stars as summarized briefly in the synopsis this is yet another spurned psycho lover gets her revenge type movie not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline but it seems like 10 000 000 000 the ex however though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre differs slightly from the norm in that at least it doesn take itself too seriously like so many other duds do malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind those involved in the movie realize they re in turkey apparently and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script the ex storyline as said incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature however the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that after while the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie diedre david first wife kills and kills and kills for example without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like it not as though she bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime david and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael their son has emotional problems specifically his inability to control his anger though david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie the connection between him and his son is not made molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son time and time again things do not add up in this movie if viewer can accept this fact then he will definately not like the ex if on the other hand he can appreciate the movie for its campiness then he ll probably like it much better don mean to necessarily suggest however that the ex is memorable exercise in camp even when viewed from an it so bad it good angle this movie isn all that successful the ex does have its moments though almost all of which involve yancy butler the psychotic diedre and nick mancuso david these two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which oftentimes elicit chuckles from the audience the truly awful lines written for them help this humor along butler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue every time her character kills someone she has punchline that unbelievably inane when she murders tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david for example diedre whacks the elderly lady with crowbar and states so sorry your lease is terminated or how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene diedre therapist wishes to have her recommitted so she decides to visit diedre alone in her new apartment never realizing of course that it not her therapists typically are catatonically brain dead in these movies having successfully snuffed the woman out diedre looks at the body and says what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session dr jones oh that right sorry but your time is up this is what passes for humor in the film the audience doesn necessarily laugh but groan the type of groan that suggests the audience can believe they re watching this crap although watching it they are nick mancuso chainsmoking nervous wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler character delivers but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief in between drags off his cigarette for instance in one of the movie best scenes david tries to explain to his lawyer what creep his ex wife is in exaggerated exasperation he nearly shouts the woman is cuckoo bird trust me it is funny in context and so the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion won reveal the ending specifically though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review but will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film molly and david own cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds molly at one point in the film not so brilliantly observes after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family to spy upon them that she crazy you be pretty crazy too if you rented this turkey avoid it unless it on tv and you come across it if you do you may want to watch it groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot and feel good that you didn spend money renting it
the blues brothers was wonderful film hilarious comedy packed with good music it cried out for sequel but john belushi untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea however eighteen years have passed and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged unfortunately it sequel not worthy of the original the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended elwood blues dan aykroyd is just getting out of jail his brother jake having recently died as in the first film he first visits mother mary stigmata kathleen freeman and then sets about getting the band back together john belushi absence leaves terrible hole in the film and although three new characters are created to fill the void it is still very noticeable first there cabel joe morton the illegitimate son of elwood stepfather played by cab calloway in the first movie cabel is reluctant to join his destiny and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff chasing the blues brothers band next there mighty mack john goodman bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band finally there buster evan bonifant ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band the plotting of the film is hardly original it seems to be almost clone of the original elwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band they then travel while being pursued by the police and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale the first film had neo nazis as the random element this time around the russian mafia and militia group fill their role in fact the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original remember the classic performance at country bob where they like both types of music country and western from the first movie well this movie has performance at country fair where the band is expected to play bluegrass music there the massive police car pileup although this time the gag falls completely flat there even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus james brown there are plenty of recurring characters too in addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs murphy frank oz prison guard in the first film makes an appearance here as the prison warden as the stars the new blues brothers don live up to their legacy aykroyd is more loquacious yet much flatter as elwood john goodman barely has character as mighty mack joe morton has the deepest character but not terribly interesting one as cab and what the deal with the orphan it plays like desperate gimmick that doesn mesh at all with the rest of the film at least bonifant isn as precocious as he could have been in the role but the true star and the only saving grace of the film is the music and the film is packed with it even during and after the ending credits although there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the original rawhide stand by your man medley the music is very much enjoyable to top it off the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances king blues traveler eric clapton travis tritt wilson pickett erykah badu bo diddley and steve winwood are just sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here and there unfortunately the music pauses here and there to allow in the familiar plot if simply copying the original blues brothers wasn bad enough writers aykroyd and john landis dumb it down removing any memorable characters and replacing them with flashy but unbelievable magical gimmicks it shame buy the soundtrack and avoid the film better yet rewatch the original you ll have much better time
michael crichton has had long career of writing novels many of which are science fiction the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of michael crichton science fiction novel so in the logic of the film industry good way to make profitable film would be to make big budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel congo failed and am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare whole lot better it little better than just okay novel and it makes film that is not even that good the film is expensive over one hundred million dollars is long 133 minutes has terrific cast including dustin hoffman samuel jackson and sharon stone but has little that is really original and less that is exciting several years ago dr norman goodman played by dustin hoffman was asked to write up set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered the plan he wrote was only semi serious but did explicitly define team of experts who should investigate the alien now that team has been assembled by mysterious team leader named barnes peter coyote to study spacecraft almost half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s suddenly norman less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with real alien spacecraft included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams samuel jackson biologist beth halperin sharon stone and astrophysicist ted fielding liev schreiber together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship what is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects the problem here is he is making big budget science fiction film it has some effects but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on radar screen the technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewer imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting that could be reasonable approach in low budget film but that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster it requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put they don hoffman acting seems muted jackson seems to laid back we do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads levinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance and why we have queen latifah as minor functionary on the expedition is anybody guess cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at fraction of the price look how much more powerful film like alien was with only moderate actors most science fiction spectaculars these days have second tier actors and first tier special effects levinson tries second tier effects and first tier actors but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer perhaps sci fi spectaculars are just not an actor medium the result gets on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale
american pie is filled with laughs but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for locker room than movie theater no prude and admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself what separates american pie from its predecessor is heart of the original noted it was warm pleasant outing about the travails of growing up well the quartet of chums jim jason biggs oz chris klein kevin thomas ian nicholas and finch eddie kaye thomas have grown up at least they are year older but don seem any wiser fresh from their first year of college the quartet along with the obnoxious stifler seann william scott rent summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score as usual nothing goes right until the last reel but what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women and american pie is rather degrading to women for the most part they are not shown as individuals they are nothing more than potential recipients of over active raging hormones it is telling that the most normal couple oz and heather mena suvari spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex she overseas on an exchange student program despite having been to college jim is still klutzy and awkward unsure of himself around the opposite sex most of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him including painful episode involving an instant glue like substance also uncomfortable to watch is sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates whom the boys suspect of being lesbians it is offensive and plays upon outdated adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs the first film despite some raunchy moments had an innocent charm to it the sequel is more cynical it knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them the many mentions of finch encounter with stifler mom becomes tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy return as jim well meaning trying to be hip dad the only performer who is actually given some new fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle the band geek from the original in the sequel she imbues her character with vulnerability wisdom and maturity american pie is pre sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office it is shame though that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz who also penned the original could not have set his sights higher american pie is funny but it still comedown as well as letdown
well what are you going to expect it movie about big snake that eats people that what should have been thinking when viewed this film because maybe then would have enjoyed myself more instead ended up wishing giant snake would come along and eat me too anaconda is about documentary film crew sailing down south american river led by anthropologists dr steven cale eric stolz and terri flores jennifer lopez the crew is attempting to locate lost tribe of natives along the way they find poacher paul sarone jon voight and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda to simply say that this is the world largest snake wouldn be doing it justice since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide if this isn good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers don know what is at the beginning of anaconda we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past but that seems to be more or less over now expected that fact to play key part somewhere down the line but it ended up being set up for nothing cale chokes on deadly wasp don ask me how that happens don know and is put out of action relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help this minimally helps to add sense of urgency for the plot since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone plan to capture the snake however this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle most bad characters are either annoying or stupid in this movie they re both since this description applies to all the characters except sarone it hard to find someone to root for you re supposed to back the good guys but you really end up cheering for sarone because he smarter than everyone else or maybe he just not as dumb as everyone else at times almost found myself rooting for the snake there are no standout performances here everyone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters even voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason no matter as in most monster movies the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway in most of the scenes the snake is computer generated and the effects crew did decent job of making it look real however the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences sometimes for example the snake just moves too fast it catches guy jumping off of waterfall for crying out loud then there another scene where the snake eats one of the characters and we see the snake skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim pained expression from within the snake belly absolutely ridiculous testimony to the film bad direction is the inclusion of scene early on the in the film where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is in scene totally unrelated to anything else we are witness to the big snake winning showdown with panther the anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard one of the panther eyeballs pops out eeeewwwww above and beyond the sick factor however this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before quarter of the movie had even passed in films like these sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained if the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them to show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don know about and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown in case like that the showdown just ends up being letdown when saw the snake for the first time decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake saw wasn the real danger this one was just decoy and there was actually bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe no such luck okay maybe anaconda is actually decoy and there really better movie waiting to make its debut
this film is extraordinarily horrendous and not going to waste any more words on it
midway through anaconda documentary filmmaker terri flores jennifer lopez turns to co worker and says thought this movie would be my first big break instead it turned into disaster truer words have never been spoken anaconda is monster movie with lousy monster it suspense film that is utterly predictable it mess the film does manage to drum up some scares but only in the most elementary way like jack in the box as you turn the crank you re totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up but somehow it still mildly startling when it happens the main difference between the giant snake in anaconda and the clown in jack in the box is that the clown is more realistic anaconda boasts some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe inducing robots you ve endured at disney world but it the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame in one shot character tries to flee from the monster by diving from tree near waterfall but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air the scene if done well would have been jaw dropper here the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than saturday morning cartoon what really amazing is that the filmmaker were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie but enough about the phony snakes now it time to talk about the lousy story heroic and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads documentary film crew down brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest stoltz tells his crew pray that you didn forget your bug spray apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no ill effect along the way the group rescues whacked out lapsed priest jon voight who claims to know how to find the shirishama within minutes they throw away all their plans and follow voight down tributary into the land of creepiness from that point on the film is hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from jaws and dead calm one of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of eric stoltz early in the story his character gets knocked into coma by river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious so why did they hire an actor of the caliber of stoltz for what amounts to cameo appearance also why did stoltz who generally selects his roles with great care agree to appear in this crap ah the mysteries of hollywood the remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary but lopez and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters lopez who starred in selena is an enormously appealing performer possessing vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible ice cube has special charisma an ability to look like macho adult and frightened boy simultaneously there also special twinkle in his eyes as if he gently mocking his own tough guy posturing but the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight obsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas voight plays the villain in thick accent with series of leers and hisses spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of jonny quest at one point he looms over the crew and says the anaconda is the perfect killing machine it strikes wraps around you holds you tighter than your true love and you get the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode that moment is so high camp that it almost made the film tolerable almost fans of the horror genre may be tempted to check out anaconda don there are lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer including another alien sequel wait for them rent jaws in the meantime and don throw away your money and time on drivel like this

well lets see not quite sure how to review this film based on its laughter factor well yeah can it not funny ok so laughed one time which warranted the star but other than that sat in my seat wondering when this pos would be over which at running time of 107 minutes seemed like forever in fact this could be the un funniest movie ve seen in long time if not the un funniest let me be the first to say ready to rumble is huge disappointment long time wrestling lovers david and scott dream of making it to the wcw and watching jimmy king wrestle that is their hero of course whom is kicked out of the wcw well here is where the plot thickens lol the two wish to rescue the king and put him back into the wcw but not that easily because they are being tampered with by many people who are out to get them while david father wants him to become police officer and scott is loser who has to with the help of david clean out johnny on the spots what plot eh ready to rumble is one of those films that tries to be funny but sadly fails miserably everything in the film is imcomprehinsable and even the trailer wasn funny the actors are dull the script awful and the plot which there isn much of really annoying not quite sure how great actors like these and very funny actors too are given such lame script and directed in such childish manner that wonder if hollywood is ever gonna make good films these days this review isn going to be very long because of the fact that there isn much going for the film if anything at all only one big laugh is in the film which isn all that hilarious sat in my chair wondering with this 107 minute comedy was going to be over and sadly it went on forever not sure if anything could have saved this film from being such total waste but believe me you it is reviewed by brandon herring 29 00 for more reviews please visit movie review central at http www geocities com moviefan983 moviereviewcentral html
14 years ago national lampoon introduced us to new family the griswolds in 1983 the griswolds embarked on cross country journey with the destination of wally world world renowned theme park in california we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured two years later we watched again as they went to europe and four years after that we shared christmas with them now eight more years have passed and the laughs have done more than die they ve been cremated vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold the good intentioned but ill fated father of two the premise is basically the same clark has wonderful idea to take his family on bonding vacation this time to las vegas his wife ellen beverly angelo and teenage kids rusty and audrey always played by different actors this time around by ethan embry and marisol nichols respectively join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick of course vacation movie wouldn be complete without good ole eddie reprised by randy quaid the misfit cousin showing up at all the wrong times there isn too much of plot here when it comes right down to it it really just skit movie there are couple of ways to define skit movie which is not real term as far as know the first would be movie that basically has one running gag for two hours therefore coming off like two hour skit the second would be movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits each lasting about five minutes vegas vacation comes off like the first good example of the latter would be last year siyah sheep the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast and it doesn really fit into movie mold in these cases plot which is generally very thin is used either as shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags have good vegas joke make vegas movie such is the case with this movie mini plots clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold money ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton rusty has fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie shae lyn as an exotic dancer the simple fact is this movie isn funny at first did find myself chuckling heartily at couple of little jokes but when the movie got rolling my interest suddenly stopped chase plays clark griswold really well he made the character and he is the character angelo to be quite honest never was too impressive as ellen and this movie doesn show any signs of redemption as for the two new griswold kids the word blah comes to mind the vacation series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters the simple reason being that there is nothing to them they re so generic you ll expect the credits to read girl #1 as audrey griswold vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor yes it true that vegas vacation isn even close to being close to being as funny as the others which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways but there are couple of other things that set this one negatively apart first off why did they leave off the national lampoon heading on the title couldn find any reasons why but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn want to be associated with such lame film that saying lot especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented loaded weapon pcu etc if they expected this to be another hit you would assume they be proud to tack on the notorious header but for reasons only we can guess at like the movie sucking they didn there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact the first three films in the vacation series were written by john hughes talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80 including mr mom sixteen candles the breakfast club weird science pretty in pink ferris bueller day off planes trains and automobiles and uncle buck wowzers what sum looking at the names you think this guy wrote everything that now stands as movie icon for the 1980 well that not all this guy also brought us 90 hits including the home alone series the remake of 101 dalmatians dennis the menace and the current flubber vegas vacation however didn have john hughes behind it and the loss is very obvious this time around the script is in the hands of elisa bell whose only credits thus far include four made for tv movies vegas vacation plays very much like one and it would actually work much better as made for tv sequel if this sounds like wild idea it not revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies and they seemed like it vegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as 00 sunday morning movie but as silver screen major motion picture it quite out of place stephen kessler jejune direction doesn help things either he only makes the film even more tv movie ish each consecutive vacation movie has suffered drop in directing power we started the series off with harold ramis who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co writing ghostbusters not too bad then we had national lampoon european vacation being directed by amy heckerling who would go on to direct the hits look who talking and clueless as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high lastly we had national lampoon christmas vacation directed by jeremiah chechik who went on to direct the charming benny joon kessler so far has one title under his belt the short film birch street gym which received an oscar nomination in 1992 granted that this was his first attempt at feature length film we can allow for some amateurish quality but instead we get movie straight from the text book boring bland and deeply unoriginal if you loved the vacation movies and know some of us did there still isn anything here worth seeing if you loved them don ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte if you never did like the series why the need to confirm why
plunkett macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott brother of ridley and tony naturally this got me worried would jake talent be inherited from ridley or tony if it was from ridley than the movie would be thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in if it was from tony it would be wham bang drivel unfortunately the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm carlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen plunkett carlyle who is poor and unruly and captain james macleane miller clean cut gentleman as the tagline clearly wants to make known they rob the rich and nothing else the film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca tyler hot on both their tails is mr chance ken stott who wants to see them both dead plunkett macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose although undoubtedly slick and fast paced there very little merit contained in the film carlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair although their characters are criminally undeveloped it appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes but not on the script the five screenwriters three credited have produced an still born movie there very little development in the story also major events such as mr cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are are so rushed that they barely happened the story is bit of mess frankly the performances aren bad carlyle and miller are typical lads but liv tyler is huge disappointment as the love interest her irritable stilted performance sticks out like sore thumb and was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on she looks nice though more interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester and although his character amounts to nothing more than two dimensional comedy gay character he hams it up well ken stott is suitably evil as chance but again he is nothing but flat character didn particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived although disappointment in writing and minor success in acting the film certainly look lavish with good costumes and wonderful sets but production design alone can save movie especially movie as bad as this mess jake scott would be more suited to directing music video rather than this failed update of period drama the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty with ck this and stand and cking deliver splattered all over the place the mtv editing and direction are flash enough but in the end decidedly empty plunkett macleane is massive disappointment although somewhat enjoyable during parts it so light it could float off the screen if it wasn just images on reel there no thought no development no plot just series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to gen xers although it great idea update period drama to the mtv generation it execution is awful and would more likely bore than excite sloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless it hard to recommend plunkett macleane as movie but easy to recommend it as overlong music video give it miss
capsule silly and inane adaptation of gibson short story which is nowhere in sight gibson script only adds insult to injury johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie say awesomely because it one thing to fail but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged keanur reeves who is terrible stars as johnny an information courier who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head he is given one last job whenever you are in movie and you hear those words run which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories but it only followed up on in token fashion for his trouble johnny gets chased by the yakuza who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high tech thrillers what funny is that if you watch gangster movies made in japan there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics but of course there no room in this movie for any of that the yakuza are simply used to point guns wave swords flaunt tattoos and grimace menacingly could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies bound by honor sugar hill and american me come to mind when asians remain perpetually stereotyped but that another essay anyway johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark why newark maybe because it was cheaper to fake future newark than future new york that why there he meets an assortment of odd characters ice dolph lundgren and henry rollins play whole gallery of weirdos the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture it turns out what else that the data in johnny head could save lot of people but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesn kill him handled right this could have been absorbing but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other better movies blade runner and brazil come to mind everything looks run down and scummy everyone dresses like they re punk rockers and videophones are commonplace snore the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves but kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively un technical fellow would think it would look and behave like hacker of johnny caliber would be blasting away with one command line function after another instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms but of course that not cinematic whatever what went wrong with this movie gibson wrote his own screenplay which guess is part of the problem what works as short story doesn work in movie his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesn advance it convulses from the script on out it was probably all downhill renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless there no fun in kicking wounded dog is there
didn hate the big hit even though it is stupefyingly terrible film for the entirety of its running time my eyes were attached to the screen and never once got bored found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness this is such confused disaster of film that it entertaining to watch it in the same way that it entertaining to witness thirty car pileup on freeway spaghetti bowl as narrative the big hit is pure garbage never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries it reminded me lot of grosse pointe blank which is similar film that fails in lot of the same ways it fine to mix genres if the film makers know what they re doing unfortunately writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don seem to know how to handle the material and the result is an action film that wants to be comedy the biggest problem with the amalgamation in this case is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place but it sure is fascinating failure marky er mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley hitman he good hitman apparently although his tactics seem bit rambunctious he doesn snipe or make clean kills he just kicks the door down and shoots everything he works with few other hitmen cisco lou diamond phillips crunch bokeem woodbine and vinnie antonio sabbato jr they re nice bunch of muscular guys who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex they all work for man named paris avery brooks who is rich powerful and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own this of course is where the plot comes in they decide to kidnap young japanese girl named keiko china chow who has rich father when they do this it turns out she is paris goddaughter it very bad to have paris against you the story is standard action film stuff it nothing new and nothing particularly offensive but certainly not the slightest bit compelling clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it john woo type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy it true that lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea such as face off and the replacement killers which are both far superior there are stunts that are fun to watch the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns melvin is also very good at breakdancing and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives like said it not boring most disasters aren what makes it so bad is its genre shifting madness it seems to start out as quirky but realistic action comedy as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains then as soon as they go to their first hit it turns into music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere then somewhere in between it turns back into comedy keiko turns out to be spunky little girl in one amusing scene she is forced to read letter out loud indicating that she has been kidnapped but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words and scenes like this work alone but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious or not be in the film at all one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped when cisco gets there paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it but they let him out of there telling him to find the perpetrator the scene is played for laughs but it isn funny and since it doesn quite work as comedy it tries to fall back on the action which also fails this is film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with handgun cars land on tree branches and are supported by them characters betray each other without second thought grenades are thrown in tight places people jump out of tall buildings and survive people outrun tumbling cars and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds most frustrating of all though is the film definition of hit man these guys are anything but subtle quiet and skilled individuals they re more like socially depraved militia men melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage including missile launchers and hand held machineguns the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest this obviously doesn make for deep or interesting people to watch the acting is kind of fun though wahlberg is good actor and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in silly sort of way phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character while christina applegate who plays melvin fianc is convincingly air headed the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny the funniest parts are supplied by the actors and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one liners it true disaster one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional despite all this though must reiterate the entertainment value here you can cherish the awfulness of film like this if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is you just might enjoy yourself
when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain you know that you can expect nothing more than grade action movie however since this film also featured michael madsen more than capable character actor this time in the role of protagonist the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt however the very first scenes show clear grade action credentials madsen plays richard montana tough policeman who raids drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio played by lynch however the raid was only partially successful and montana is getting the rap so he begins his own private war against gio trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt in the process he meets gio mistress gina zamora played by rosie vela and starts relationship with her too although it doesn stink like many of the similar films can inside edge is mostly forgettable grade action routine nobody in this film actually puts much effort including madsen or lynch and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke the only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela who apart from showing her more than impressive looks shows some of the singing talent too however this isn reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching film that they would in most likelihood forget the next day
what are the warning signs of terrible movie making it debut at the dollar theater locally chairman of the board did just that having the annoying prop comic scott thompson better known as carrot top in the lead role chairman of the board once again how about an overly exhausted paper thin plot approached with utter incompetence did somebody say chairman of the board that right carrot top long dreaded major motion picture debut at least for starring role is poking up in handful of theaters across the country chairman of the board stars the obnoxious wannabe zany king of redheaded standup comics as lazy but creative inventive but uneventful generation er named edison living with pair of surfer dudes in small rented house edison bounces from job to job always squandering away the money on his eccentric to say the least inventions and ignoring crucial responsibilities such as rent this has the crabby landlady ms krubavitch estelle harris best known as george constanza mother on seinfeld threatening an eviction if past due expenses aren furnished post haste as luck would have it edison soon meets armand mcmillan jack warden an old surfer dude who just so happens to be president of the multi million dollar mcmillan industries sharing passion for more than just riding waves armand is deeply impacted by the young inventor notebook of dreams and ideas and when the old man dies soon afterward edison learns he is named benefactor in armand will predictably edison acquires the entire corporation and has to maintain productivity with absolutely no knowledge of the business world predictably there is bitter nephew larry miller whose lesser inheritance fuels resentment that will lead to an elaborate sabotage plot predictably there is an attractive employee courtney thorne smith whose initial repulsion will transform into love for our doofy protagonist predictably the man who knows nothing will fight against the odds and give the company it most profitable and successful turnaround ever all because he ran things by common sense and not greed it as though writers turi meyer al septien and alex zamm meyer and septien also wrote leprechaun together pulled plot out of hat and worked carrot top into it the jokes the surprises the developments all of them run such predictable path it may only be carrot top signature brazen kirmizi hairdo that sets this one apart from the myriad of similar films movie this bad speaks for itself what left to say when every element the movie possesses is shameful retread of movies past the script is 100% recycled the direction is hokey and the acting is absolutely horrible it is only thorne smith who seems to take her job seriously an accomplishment which surely deserves the medal of honor she certainly went beyond the call of duty she has to kiss carrot top barf bag please movies like this give the audience nothing to do but ponder just how many synonyms for bad there really are chairman of the board without doubt deserves each and every one the only way this won end up on everybody bottom ten of the year list is if they were lucky enough never to have seen it just because you can miss his outlandish fiery mane don skimp on avoiding this abhorrent feature
you don look at ren magritte painting and search for deeper meaning you likewise don look at one for 88 minutes straight surrealist works are notable for their quirks and they are fun but looking at one quirk for an hour and half is exhausting that was my experience with woke up early the day died surrealistic hyperactive comedy with no dialogue it not silent movie there is lots of atmospheric music occasional screams and weird sound effects but nobody ever utters an audible word though the film is distinctive its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes and as it progressed watching became chore the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo legendary ed wood the man behind such classics as plan >from outer space and night of the ghouls the joke of course is that his films are so bad they re good so humorous in their inanity that they become hits woke up early the day died unfortunatly is so bad that it really bad it stars billy zane titanic as dangerous lunatic who overpowers nurse escapes from mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around stealing car clothes and load of money our thief reaches cemetery where he witnesses bizarre ritual he falls asleep and finds himself literally in hole with his money gone for whatever reason he is bent on getting his hard unearned cash back considering how easily he stole it the first time why didn he just go steal some more he comes upon list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they don have what he is looking for don think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made glorious 20 minute short the subject and the style seem to have been made for it unfortunately twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on up to the point where halfway through was already weary it might seem odd that film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is woke up early the day died is comedy guess though it could have fooled me unlike most ed wood films this one tries to be funny and fails instead of the other way around there nothing inherently wrong with that in fact think it would only make sense for someone who has been so good at making unintentional comedies to take stab at real one whether wood actually went for comedy in his script we ll never know but in either case this is failure jonathan taylor thomas christina ricci summer phoenix john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos ricci for example plays prostitute her role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out thomas is an astonished onlooker as woman gets thrown off cliff was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work zane meanwhile occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature the carnival side show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this no budget production it desperately unfunny but thinks it the funniest thing since plan it so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for woke up early the day died is not fitting send off 1999 eugene novikov &#137
well as check my score card for what ve done this holiday weekend it reads good ideas and dumb ideas don know what was thinking when decided to watch this movie but in my defense can only say that it was someone else who urged me to see this with him the film that talking about is `a night at the roxbury one of those offerings based on saturday night live skit wayne and garth these two are not rather we meet doug and steve butabi the actors names are not worth mentioning two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding way to get into the hottest night club in the city the roxbury driving in their dad bmw and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club `have you met my friend washington and his friend roosevelt they confidently say as they pull out spare pocket change their second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pick up lines as is humanly possible in order to start conversation with girl `let me see that label just as thought made in heaven says one of the brothers and like the losers that they are they fail to do either for much of the film however as fate would have it an accidental meeting with `what ever happened to richard grieco gives them the all important ticket to get in their sad lives take on whole new direction they make an important contact with the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene and they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women but their newfound popularity does not impress their father who has other plans for them the unfortunate thing about this film is that this is one joke movie and the brothers are the joke actually there about 10 mintues worth of tolerable stuff alas too long for tv and way too short for feature length film thus there just isn enough material to sustain the 83 minute movie there no plot to be found and everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to the funky beat of haddaway europop song what is love was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash to take up more film time there is subplot involving the daughter of the businessman next door who wants to marry doug this creates not only friction between the brothers but their unlikely pairing will also agitate audience members as well she educated and forebearing witch meanwhile doug is complete loser how did these two ever get together suppose that if can ever figure out the answer to that question ll have figured out why decided to go and see this movie if you re looking for entertainment you won find it at the roxbury
terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones world war ii novel unfortunately he buried it within an overlong and overreaching hour long pseudo epic this is shame because the film features an outstanding performance by nick nolte the best scene is when nick nolte character lt col tall is forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt staros elias koteas to execute an order nolte reaction and transformation may be the best work of his career had terrence malick concentrated on the great performances of nolte and koteas as well as those by sean penn woody harrelson and john cusack he could have made truly great film instead malick saddled the film with plodding pacing unnecessary flashbacks and voice over narration all designed to telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the story the narration was especially annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry with lot of editing the core story could be transformed into truly classic war film hopefully the dvd version of this film will feature options to suppress the narration and perhaps will even provide for an alternate shorter version of the film give this film
cried during _babe_ admit it the special effects the story the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was children film so much so that yes got little overly sentimental such my friend is the power of cinema when word came out that they were using this newly developed for doctor dolittle update in which eddie murphy plays the title character and many great comic actors supply the voices my anticipation rose to great expectations they can possibly drop the ball on this one can miss can possibly miss they missed what went wrong after much thought supply three general rules don let television actress turned comedy movie director near an urbanite script penny marshall dreadful preacher wife betty thomas worked wonders with the brady bunch movie but the same sitcom airiness doesn quite work here it as if she lifted generic sitcom and iced it with light doses of modern r&b take away the siyah cast take away the atrocious soundtrack and you have the residue of some mid 80 kirk cameron show the greater the cast the less the individual cast member has to do con air it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman garry schandling john leguizimo ellen degeneres and gilbert godfried in your lineup but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped stereotyped characters one line at time it even worse because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you don get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits now there are three character actors who do get special treatment albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he in and the scenes as depressed tiger do resonate certain poignancy norm mcdonald fares nearly as well as stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle but there little humor here that rests on the shoulders of chris rock sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wise ass guinea pig even the mouth is ill synched don let the special effects technicians walk away with the script there certain timing that mandatory in comedy to have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson creature shop is travesty this is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren well timed laughfests with the right director they can be and have here betty thomas is clearly over her head wish could commend the special effects but they re merely average count the number of times where the animal mouth is turned away from the camera or too far to notice or ill synched this is less babe and more of look who barking clone you may be wondering how does eddie murphy fare well he came back with the exceptional nutty professor and don doubt he can come back again here he tied into straight man and given little to do the exceptions are when he fears he going crazy far cry from his smarter than you expect routine that he more adept at it unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years after all this what left butt jokes _lot_ of butt jokes guess for kids that may be funny but was stone faced if there lesson the film may be telling us is that animals have feelings too and they care way too much for your butt
saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night and have to say wasn too impressed this film is about an expert marine sniper played by tom berenger who is teamed with hot shot young no experience never killed man new partner to take out some drug kingpins and military strong men in panama sound cliche that only the beginning billy zane memphis belle played the rookie and never seemed to get handle on his character he was so contrary and pig headed in the beginning you just wanted to smack him then he goes crazy from the pressure but seems to immediately snap out of it not sure if the blame should lie with the directing editing scriptwriting or acting but it didn all come together think berenger is pretty good actor and he looked great in the part covered in camo face painted stalking through the jungle with his high power rifle but once again his character was given some pretty bad dialogue and didn react too logically to many of the situations there was very little logical development in these characters my biggest problem with this film was it tendency to put these two snipers in as many inches from death situations as possible they began to resemble joes the greatest american hero and of course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls now lot of movies are stamped out of this mold in fact that what made die hard so much fun the super hero avenger type so some will enjoy the action hero heroics but didn think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes and the real life feel of covert operations in panama word must be said on the camera work much of it was very nice the jungles of panama or their stand ins in this case formed very picturesque background and the drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography many have seen the slowed down bullet cam following the projectile to its target this was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill it was dramatic when used in flashback but it seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots pardon the pun into the real time action then it just seemed silly all in all not real dog there is some nice action good atmosphere and pretty photography but the plot is pretty lame the acting didn form cohesive whole and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics
an 18 foot high 43 foot long dragon is the computer generated co star of this strictly by the numbers sword sorcery flick as voiced by sean connery draco is surprisingly expressive creation who is well deserving of his 23 minutes of screen time he walks talks flies fries and even fakes his own death all with the help of 96 computer aided animators too bad that ilm industrial light and magic couldn spare some special effects for dragonheart human co stars bearded siyah hole exists where dennis quaid should be he near total loss as he growls glumly through his role of disillusioned knight david thewlis evil king has high hiss factor hf though he more of mumbling oddity than anything else oh and there some redhead in 90 wig who runs around either screaming or scowling depending upon if the particular scene has her playing the woman in peril or the put upon peasant the fringe flourishes include pete postlethwaite as wandering monk with literary ambitions julie christie as the good queen mother band of mercenaries that appear dressed for ye olde heavy metal concert and believe or it not the speaking spirit of king arthur bring out your dead unfortunately when we add it all together draco fringe bits quaid thewlis the sum total amounts to zero dragonheart is well too much of too little director rob cohen dragon the bruce lee story has made big expensive movie that while ambitiously plotted is both murky and predictable and overscored and self important and the list goes on must ask did screenwriter charles edward pogue intend that every character be stabbed lanced or sliced at least once keep that man away from the knife drawer the last five minutes of this movie are the worst with some silly celestial nonsense that would be laughed out of any planetarium light show much less summer movie save your money
1989 major league was delightful surprise didn expect much of it when decided to watch it on cable but it proved to be fresh and funny however when the appeal of movie is its freshness the sequels are virtually guaranteed to be stale that certainly true of major league ii and the most recent entry major league back to the minors the title is of course contradiction shouldn it be minor league that contradiction suggests the lengths to which writer director john warren has gone to squeeze third movie out of the formula established by the first movie original stars charlie sheen and tom berenger who returned for major league ii are not around leaving corbin bernsen the only original headliner to make the third movie the other veterans who return dennis haysbert as voodoo inspired batter cerrano and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka who was introduced in league ii seem to be around just to lend legitimacy to the enterprise the only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle inexplicably broadcasting the games of minor league team far from his home turf the protagonist this time around is retiring pitcher gus cantrell scott bakula who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn bernsen to manage the twins aaa team the buzz you can write the movie from here he finds group of misfits who need to learn how to play together as team in order to win there future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing walton goggins an ex ballet dancer kenneth johnson broken down old timer thom barry twin outfielders both named juan the difilippo triplets and couple pitchers with throwing problems judson mills and peter mackenzie along the way gus picks up cerrano and tanaka gus is supposedly an old teammate of theirs even though he wasn in either of the preceding films sum total none the entire enterprise is artificial and the cast is not ready for the hollywood majors gus antagonist is twins manager leonard huff ted mcginley leonard is slimy sniveling little egotist and the twins are lazy spoiled and full of themselves even watching the first movie wondered why any real life team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner gus challenges leonard to match the buzz vs the twins wanna guess who wins back to the minors is movie that has no reason to exist there hardly laugh in it the cast is weak and the first movie left no room for even one sequel
the following review contains some harsh language but what did you expect when you clicked on this title cast kristen holly smith danica sheridan alex boling michael dotson sonya hensley janet krajeski sabrina lu dionysius burbano calvin grant jeff harmon written and directed by jeff harmon running time 97 minutes the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside blatz balinski danica sheridan laments the fact that her lesbian lover april kristen holly smith has just received telegram from her ex fiance isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot smith resident of the small town of bumfuck arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson michael dotson when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home sticks gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger instead of killing herself she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed except for lance the homosexual toilet cleaner slave april loves her new home and friends but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up mr and ms pfferpot director jeff harmon and janet krajeski decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr sigmoid colon also jeff harmon who claims he can cure homosexuality in actuality dr colon is homosexual as well and begins his special treatment on dick dickson unbeknownst to dick when april turns down dick demand for her to return to bumfuck he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo style instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance alex boling and the two of them along with april and her lover blatz get married note to the filmmaker why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided april parents feeling like there is no recourse call in favor to president clinton and send nuclear bomb whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of homosexual performer their way the bomb is dud thanks to the work of the circuitry and they re wire it and send it back to washington destroying it mr and ms pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own not sure if writer director co star jeff harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs either way he manages to present some of the most offensive material have ever seen in movie the film opens with preacher running small african american child out of town and then later moves on to the hanging of michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan during jaunty musical number preceded by remarks about gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others such as the jews if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be then apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film but it is presented so mean spiritedly that can help but feel like he had some serious intent as for the entire central theme of the movie afraid that it one that just don get tried to keep an open mind while watching it but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non acceptance not prone to judging anyone and believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society but don force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me again maybe missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make but if so think it could have been handled little more tactfully as far as musical comedies go isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical but good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy despite the disturbing visuals mom and apple pie stuck with me for the rest of the day speaking of disturbing visuals wedding bells ain ringing could have been decent song but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying lesbian which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular is also pretty good but good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms smith it mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based the other performers are decent save for the rosie donnell like performance given by danica sheridan have no inherent problem with her character it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired one particular musical number lesbian rock was one of the lowest points have ever experienced in my film going life thanks to strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll the remainder of the running time is padded out with few more songs lesbian rock included and the ridiculously presented anti nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it feature length film once the isle of lesbos reprise was reached felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www indie underground com the transfer is pretty clean and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent and the film is letterboxed at approximately 85 in many respects isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential like rocky horror for the new millennium this film is by no means my cup of tea but know there are those out there who will enjoy it if you think it might be for you then by all means seek it out on the other hand will be cleansing my palette with good action film like gladiator wait aren gladiator films considered to be oh never mind
one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself such was the case with boxing helena 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch daughter of the great david lynch made in the dying years of post twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs it was hyped as another warped twisted masterpiece of lynch clan kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract but the result was extremely disappointing film which quickly sank into well deserved oblivion the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh played by julian sands talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena sherilyn fenn beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re establish the relationship during one of such occasions helena is hit by car and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her after she wakes up helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh stylish residence but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping she is still trying to escape so cavanaugh takes off her arms apart from casting sherilyn fenn audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies this film by ms lynch hasn got anything in common with the works of director more talented father despite rather bizarre subject the style of this film is conventional and setting is light characters are beautiful but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos the actors aren good either julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains being neurotic doesn suit him bill paxton was better for this role but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena boyfriend sherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks but even the her greater effort in acting couldn help this film the screenplay on the other hand is awful at least for someone who had made best seller with laura palmer diary the events in this movie are implausible characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion one of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh regular girlfriend played by betsy clarke the twist at the end although unpredictable is unbelievable and the viewers who had the stomach to endure entire film would feel cheated all in all boxing helena is disorganised quasi artistic mess of movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basinger career
let get this one over with as quickly as possible if there was possibility to receive refund this review would not be forthcoming but as it is godzilla is without doubt the loudest longest and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through major studio producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch last year at merienbad until they can grasp the idea of content and plot no amount of hype no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine billy the kid vs dracula godzilla opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs we are then introduced to the crew of japanese fish canning ship questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins well the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature later group of frenchmen led by philippe roache jean reno interview the sole survivor in state of shock the only thing the man can utter is the word gojira the japanese name of the famed beast we are then introduced to dr nick tatopoulos matthew broderick with moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population he is immediately drafted by the military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of creature in short amount of time another fishing boat loaded with canned tuna from the and korea for some reason is found grounded in jamaica well it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york when the beast finally appears he tears up one building stomps couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert thumbs up for new york the military with dr tatopoulos help have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has cute face to face with dr tatopoulos who snaps the beast picture the monster eats the fish the military starts shooting and the chase is on with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage working from hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple dr totopoulos buys few home pregnancy kits from local drugstore that has chosen to remain open even though new york has been evacuated well the test proves that the monster is hermaphrodite and is pregnant needless to say no one believes the good doctor about his discovery so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city even though the monster isn dead yet sincerely hope that ve completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film gave away the relevant plot so that could spare those of you courageous or foolish enough to drop down an hour wage on this tripe everything about godzilla reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast the script and let be clear here by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years razzie award the dialogue between maria pitillo as audrey timmonds dr tatopoulos estranged girlfriend and mr broderick is so adolescent it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief as happened during the screening witnessed the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn take itself so damn seriously but to what end as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind no godzilla is just big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it the film is bleak and ugly looking taking place at night during rain storm the movie has little or no depth everything is ugly and dark new york has never looked so inhospitable since death wish in an attempt to give the film some color audrey timmonds carries bright kirmizi umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue the only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica where dr tatopoulos finds himself standing in giant footprint the scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up you know from the outset that nick is standing in footprint for scientist this is very poor observation let look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film this activity is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs and how do those eggs fuse into one beast why would cold blooded creature choose cold climate such as new york to nest don think iguana have habit of migrating how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system slice submarine in half yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin in comparison steel cable on the brooklyn bridge the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it suspension cables did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly if so then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures note each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide godzilla would have to be over 000 feet tall to carry them all godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters but new york cabs are made of stronger steel godzilla can out maneuver helicopters bullets torpedoes and missiles but can catch you on foot taxis can out maneuver godzilla godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can tear through the park avenue tunnel 10 why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla maybe giant hermit crab in the sequel 11 galapagos iguana actually live in the french polynesian islands 12 why was dr tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway 13 how did they evacuate new york island in less than day and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey 14 new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting new yorkers hate beta cam could go on and on but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is don be fooled this film has less gray matter than any episode of america funniest home videos the performances in the film are singularly bland not one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror the characters in the midst of the onslaught have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee failed relationships career choices the only common occurrence that doesn take place here is having one of the characters have bowel movement but then that would have made them believable godzilla for the most part is okay the design of the beast is funky if not very memorable one thing that comes to mind the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark namely his atomic breath now for one can quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait good comparison would be to make superman film and eliminate his ability to fly there is so much wrong with this film that can really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted except for my divorce any film that can have two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac the addition of the baby raptors ah meant godzillas are nothing but direct rip off of jurassic park but with none of that film suspense or tension suffice to say that godzilla is without doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade this is film that needed the hype with the current level of writing and directing nothing else about the film succeeds if you ve seen the trailers you ve seen the best parts my only suggestion for mr and mr is that they could always go back to selling shoes this film could be the next rocky horror only it not funny
here rarity children film that attempts to tackle weighty subject is there god done well it could have been gem among the wasteland of modern children cinema unfortunately it isn with jumbled messages and an unclear audience wide awake was better left asleep fifth grader joshua beal joseph cross is in the middle of moral crisis his beloved grandfather robert loggia has died and joshua has begun quest he wants to find god to discover why bad things happen this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents dana delany and denis leary but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths at his catholic school his favorite teacher sister terry rosie donnell tries to give him guidance but this is journey he must make on his own meanwhile he is having the most momentous year of his life he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave timothy reifsnyder he gets his first crush and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey it is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be on its surface it appears to be kid film however it deals with serious issues and is likely to be boring for today instant gratification kids and while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience wide awake asks serious questions but only delivers cheap gimmick for an answer if there were bit more meat in the story adults on nostalgic bent might get kick out of the movie the actors who might have created great cast donnell leary and delany are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos the nostalgic elements best friend favorite teacher first crush etc have been done much better in other movies and actually seem more like filler here the film strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua relationship with his grandfather they show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie maybe the film would have been better if instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks it were set entirely during joshua last year with his grandpa it certainly would have been more entertaining wide awake can best be described as failed experiment it starts out with noble aspirations but never delivers on its promise parents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions that is if their kids aren bored to death first
there no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based as its opening credits proclaim on true story but if it an accurate picture of life on america mean streets than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had much stronger basis in reality than would have previously thought for from the film outset when group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles not unlike number of movie lowlifes who recently gave madonna song close reading donnie brasco resembles more than passingly few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction our eponymous hero johnny depp is not the cheap crook he first appears to be brasco is joseph pistone an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming up to lefty al pacino seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being wiseguy regrettably pistone learns his lessons all too well his concern for lefty who is burdened with heroin addicted son exacerbates his own family troubles his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband gangster persona is becoming little too convincing true the focus on pistone family life does deviate from the typical gangster flick formula but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn out domestic squabbles including an ill advised marriage guidance routine that slow the film down unnecessarily the biggest problem with donnie brasco however is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70 but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style loved those fluoro coloured suits of scorces costume drama casino more importantly pacino presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively donnie brasco take on american values for instance is feeble and obvious lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music inexplicably lefty horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us it doesn any more than his family troubles do which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone just think minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface in these pictures pacino dedication to peculiar and bloody hyper capitalism was twisted and confronting while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations donnie brasco tawdry little crime therefore isn so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes but the shameless way in which it sanitises them oh and by the way forgot to mention that the script also sports startling subplot pipstone superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination is that damn you mcbain hear from springfield way so the movie is cliched big deal what do you expect from gangster flick well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be decent example of the genre donnie brasco fails on both counts the action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp woeful performance tends to smother the good work of his comrades admittedly pacino does nothing new and michael madsen sonny simply smirks his way through the picture like slightly subdued mr beyaz but both possess an unmistakable sly charm depp usually exhibits bit of class himself but regrettably being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star struck for he is completely hell bent on mimicking pacino well earned high style the consequences are painful to watch its no exaggeration to say that the film credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family uncanny ability to keep straight face in front of their breadwinner phony brooklyn accent perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco maybe scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks if this is indeed the case surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america underworld is committed to emulating albeit in heavily attenuated form their movie namesakes depp could have poignantly played simple cop who becomes hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big screen gangster greats who knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen but then again perhaps donnie brasco isn so true after all
these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes but only few years ago before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south the way to regain popularity and prestige they thought was the use the same formulas characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place one of such celebrity was eddie murphy siyah comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade in order to return to the spotlight he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film beverly hills cop 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987 seven years later for the third instalment he used the directorial service of john landis another fading star with whom he successfully collaborated twice in trading places and coming to america this time however third time wasn the charm and beverly hills iii was failure eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback eddie murphy here plays axel foley fast talking streetwise detroit policeman who raids illegal chop shop the routine police action ends in tragedy when the criminals kill foley boss determined to bring the killers to justice foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald timothy carhart when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles foley goes back to los angeles there with the help of his old friend local policeman rosewood judge rheinhold foley would clash with money counterfeit ring ten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different in this decade the contrast between mavi collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills which provided lot of gags in 1984 film simply doesn work screenwriter steven de souza provides another conflict this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business like professionalism of the bad guys since foley belongs to the former his character had to watch his language and the tone of the film in general is more infantile unfortunately this film still belongs to action movie genre and there is too much violence for little children nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath unlike donner with the lethal weapon series landis simply can balance the comedy with regular action and the result is film that fails in both aspects action scenes are sometimes interesting but not too spectacular at the end scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself humour on the other hand falls flat to make even worse some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure especially art expert turned into arms dealer played by bronson pinchot in the end although the film provided some entertainment viewers at least critical ones would probably be happy to know that there aren any plans for beverly hills iv
have never been so confused after watching movie meet joe siyah is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year with cinematography music and cast that will dazzle most of us at the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season at first you marvel at the elegant direction graceful cinematography and sensual musical score then you ll wait for something to happen for half an hour but when you finally understand what going on you ll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in film like this the script is simply silly and unresolved story which is artificially stretched into three hour long motion picture it feels like an eternity most of the time it is pompous soap opera filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in high pitched voice and meaningful winks the film is based on alberto caesella play death takes holiday the story concentrates around bill anthony hopkins who lives fulfilled life as successful business man but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears voice that is saying yes soon he meets young elegant gentlemen brad pitt who introduces himself as death it is bill time but death has other plans it has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive our bill is chosen to be death guide and in exchange he gets time bill introduces death as joe siyah who immediately becomes the center of everyone attention bill business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill side lives in his house and resides at his office that is not all however bill youngest daughter susan claire forlani falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her this relationship is bound to have some serious consequences it wouldn be fair to say that this film didn have some interesting moments such as the scene where joe is invited to join bill family for dinner when joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love the experience is somewhat different it is obvious that story like this story is very difficult to structure it one thing to say wouldn it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth to create motion picture out of this is another four screenwriters have worked on script that lacks drive and logic it is overlong and too primitive to pass as serious film on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and very decent direction by martin brest scent of woman hopkins looks great in any role and no matter how shallow or hollow it is he will complete it his talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else since it actually saves the film from complete embarrassment but pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time how can you play death in human form to me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters they are not creatures but phenomenas saying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form handling such ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work speaking in calm soft voice portraying death as lonely distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters he looks and acts more like an angel of death rather than demon or red eyed executioner claire forlani and others are also fine stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits unfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery in other words this is not what expected from the director of scent of woman it could and should be better with such cast and crew in the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on ravishingly looking soap opera
this is crap but honestly what older american audience is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon and james garner as bicker ing ex presidents especially when their supporting players in clude dan aykroyd as the current commander in chief lauren bacall as former first lady and john heard as the dan quayle ish vice president yup you re talkin pre sold property here and for warner brothers the perfect fit into their now ritual grumpy old men holiday slot for the non discriminating viewer my fellow americans is fine the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political thriller road comedy they did in mine heaven help us for the rest of us the movie is immediately tiresome the tone is terrible and the banter is worse forget wit lemmon and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie has anyone counted the number of first penis references sure some of the bits are absurdly funny including men room macarena joke the appearance of an elvis impersonator on trainload of tarheels and an all dorothy marching band performing over the rainbow at gay men march the get there from here though you have to submit to one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores of all time judas priest is there single moment of silence in this film even the dialogue gets drowned out what waste
keep cool chinese film directed by semi accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang was one of the kickoff films for this year hawaii international film festival on the day it premiered lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get good seat in the theater they need not have wasted their time the movie is billed as comedy but is surprisingly bereft of humor there are noticeable attempts at laughs but very few tries actually click wondered if there were jokes that wasn getting because not from china but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn be attributed to the cultural barrier either keep cool just isn very funny the prelude to the film was visit by keep cool producer who with the help of an interpreter regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii although the print made it the assistant luggage was lost too bad that story wasn in the movie because it got big laugh qu ying the film female lead was also on hand to give few comments however whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed ms ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one fast paced incredibly long tirade it was dizzying good foreshadowing for the film you see keep cool is filmed almost totally with camera handheld by man with bad case of the shakes at least that the way it seems since the camera is constantly moving cinema verite is one thing but panning and shaking around until your audience has headache is another although some might consider it form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing found it thoroughly distracting and after while quite annoying headache as said the film is about young bookseller wen jiang who is after young woman qu ying they used to be romantically involved but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship the first half of the film is about the young man plan to win her back of course the thing is she doesn want to be won back and has nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up bit in the fight the young man grabs laptop computer belonging to bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker but only ends up smashing it against lamppost we later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced there is funny scene the only one in the film where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner baotian li in order to recoup his losses there is no sense to be made out of the young woman behavior cold one minute caring the next so we feel no sympathy for her character the bookseller would be better off without her although the second half of the film causes us to lose lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner hand as revenge for the beating he took it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man while the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation his quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to brick wall half the time friendship develops between the two men but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate although only an hour and half in length keep cool contains extraneous material the whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out since we don see her from the midpoint on case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner and would have saved us from the bookseller boring pursuit during the first half but of course this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour there are few things that keep cool does right as mentioned before the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good although it grows tiresome the reasoning with the unreasonable is nice exercise in logic and represents the differences in thinking between generations in one scene for example the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted and that it means something entirely different also effective is the way zhang sets up tension within scene such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner the nightclub owner is counting out money slapping each bundle of currency on the table with every shot of his hand we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge unfortunately these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film shortcomings and weren enough to prevent that headache from lingering after left the theater
although had not been viewer of the rugrats television series went into their first animated feature film the rugrats movie with positive attitude the trailer looked cute enough after all after seeing it think the words in my recent antz review in which stated that it was the worst film of its type since 1995 the pebble and the penguin were bit premature the rugrats movie is bottom of the barrel children fare at its worst and starts to make antz look good in comparison as in the show the rugrats movie is about group of very little friends ranging from babies to three year old the head of the group tommy pickles daily becomes distraught when his mother has newborn baby named dill get it dill pickles hardee har har and is informed by his three year old cousin anjelica cheryl chase that the new babies always take all of the attention away from the other children when the other children chuckie and twins lil and phil suggest taking dill back to the hospital tommy goes along with it but on their way there they crash in the forest and become lost running into wolves and circus monkeys among other things the rugrats movie judging from the idea of being lost in the woods could have been potentially fun family film and there were many different things that could have been done with the story so what did the writers choose to do why they set up protracted cliched scene where the children almost go over waterfall of course for the youngest of children ages the rugrats movie may very well entertain them judging from the audience saw this with of course if you looked around at all of the older kids and their parents they were all desperately struggling to stay awake and that included me for an adult the rugrats movie is piece of garbage the plotline is unoriginal and the writing has absolutely no wit or charm there isn one laugh to be had in the film nor is there any excitement if anything is even marginally good in the picture it is the bright animation style so it is especially unfortunate that it wasn to service more quality film the rugrats movie is doa from the start am all for worthwhile family movie but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful as said before young children may like it but even they deserve better than this for adults it is nearly unbearable excruciating chore to sit through as for me the rugrats movie is not the worst of the year nor is it the most deeply hated but it is the most boring parents do yourselves favor and take your kids to see the rerelease of the wizard of oz that is picture that contains great deal of magic and wonder two things of which the rugrats movie is completely missing
plunkett macleane is period piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions have nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking used properly it can save movie see stigmata but it ruins this one making muddled incoherent mess out of potentially interesting premise there are certain genres that just don go together the film opens with sequence that still don understand it involves some sort of prison outbreak robbery and gem that keeps being eaten in any case the caper whatever it may be brings together plunkett and macleane robert carlyle and johnny lee miller respectively two happy go lucky brits with no way to make living they make pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves until they earn enough money to buy ticket to america their first heist involves young debutante named lady rebecca liv tyler woman macleane was especially friendly with at party just earlier his decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks the name gentleman highwaymen lady rebecca also happens to be the niece of the lord chief justice glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career he demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately leaving the job in the hands of the devious chance ken stott who has few more things on his mind than catching criminals meanwhile macleane falls in love with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett who doesn want his plans to be foiled by his partner mindless romantic travails director jake scott son of ridley scott alien blade runner has his father knack for setting up atmospheric shots but none of his skill in actually moving the camera most of the action scenes are filmed in such rapid jerky way that it impossible to comprehend what going on the camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity instead of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events scott uses attention deficit disorder edits he barely ever holds shot for more than ten seconds and during the faster scenes it seems more like couple frames between each cut the weird almost defiant lack of dialogue there are no no conversations lasting over say 20 seconds undermines character definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters the love affair between macleane and rebecca is no different emotionless and unrealistic when the script calls for macleane to decide between going to america and going to meet his lover there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for him to abandon his goal he and rebecca barely even speak to each other throughout the film plunkett and macleane wants desperately to be triumph of style over substance but since its style quite frankly blows the film has no hope of succeeding on any level wanted to appreciate this movie on the basis of its admittedly kinetic pace but couldn it was so kinetic it gave me headache

fantastically over hyped godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands then an attack on boat from some beast and finally we join dr nick tatopoulos broderick looking about 17 years old doing some research in chernobyl some shady government guys appear and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints from what looks like giant lizard and what more this beast is heading for new york gulp although godzilla should be non stop roller coaster ride and at some points it is there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie the main faults lie with the acting and writing common problems with summer blockbuster movies broderick is pretty useless as the hero with no humour or tough guy image while emmerich previous summer flick independence day 1996 had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith this has neither also maria pitillo as broderick former girlfriend is just as useless with chronic disability in acting she incapable of showing emotion speaks every line in the same way and basically she total crap it up to french actor jean reno to save the day and indeed he does turning in campy performance as french secret agent shame he has such little screen time in such overlong film hank azaria also turns up as crazy cameraman named animal and he adds little life to the picture also making an appearance is harry shearer probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons as slimy news reporter so the acting is not up to par but it never is in these movies but what about the script well that not up to par either emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write script the dialogue is banal broderick looks at lot of fish and utters that lot of fish and the character development is non existent reno plays the typical frenchman no croissant broderick forever remains geeky scientist also the film is seriously lacking sense of humour the jokes that are uttered are pathetic and there an hilarious running gag about siskel and ebert the mayor is mayor ebert and is assistant is called gene ha ha ha ha the plot is dire and in the end just rips off jurassic park 1993 by having lots of baby godzilla velicorapters running around new york right so the script and acting suck but what about the special effects thankfully they re are quite good godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi although we don see much of him because the movie is so dark the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell but although they are impressive they can save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie the movie goes on for far too long aswell and it can seem to decide on ending and of course the ending itself leaves possibility for sequel let just hope one never arrives
movie concepts are often pitched to producers with mathematical formulas involving successful films of the past so undoubtedly one day someone said evolution it ghostbusters plus men in black plus tremors and so it is sum total none the alienbusting begins when meteor lands in glen canyon arizona community college science profs ira kane david duchovny and harry block orlando jones take some samples from the meteor and discover that one celled organisms from inside it are evolving rapidly doing in hours what took millions of years for life on earth just about the time was wondering hey doesn the government usually come in and take over the whole area in these movies the government came in and took over the whole area the leader of the pack gen woodman ted levine turns out to be an old nemesis of ira and ira and harry are blocked from doing further research meanwhile the organisms continue to grow until they are large enough to start attacking people by this time ira and harry have gained friend in dr allison reed julianne moore of the center for disease control country club poolboy wayne green seann william scott has also attached himself to the merry band but can they find the means to stop the aliens in time director ivan reitman seems to be revisiting his biggest hit 1984 ghostbusters but evolution falls miserably short one reason is readily apparent ghostbusters had three really funny guys as its scientists bill murray dan aykroyd and harold ramis but evolution has one really funny guy orlando jones who can adlib and milk the comic potential of lines that prove useless in anyone else hands for good measure ghostbusters had the comic talents of rick moranis evolution offers seann william scott who was much funnier in american pie and road trip than he is here scott has one amusing scene where he sings you are so beautiful to me to dragon like alien to draw it into trap other than that scott seems unable to make much of the thin material the writers gave him an actor in search of forte david duchovny looked for his gritty action hero side in playing god and his romantic side in return to me now he wants to find his wacky comedic talent what we all find is that he doesn have any look for him to be back on tv in five years or so another sad case is julianne moore who needs to be more selective about the offers she accepts she talented actress with an impressive list of credits and award nominations so why is she trying to do slapstick comedy her character has tendency to trip over and bump into things but the trait comes off as pathetic plea for laughs the sole saving grace of the film is jones he at the center of the movie funniest scene where an alien bug invades harry body and has to be pulled out through his ass jones is the only cast member who can take the comedic ball and run with it but he can carry the whole movie by himself he found himself in similar situation in the replacements where he was also the only comic talent in an ensemble cast jones will eventually find the project that will make him major comedy star but this isn it
well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task he has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films in domain that he owns it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell good action script from bad one eraser back in 1996 was confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense batman and robin in 1997 was the siyah sheep of the batman series with ridiculous acting idiotic action scenes and painfully flashy costumes now in 1999 end of days not the end of days is the third strike in tough at bat for arnold is this the end of powerful action star long lived career will arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable classic like those in the past terminator terminator judgement day predator or an unforgettable performance in great guilty pleasure like those in the past commando kirmizi sonja true lies it doesn look that way end of days begins with the birth of baby girl in 1979 who inexorably due to the formation of the stars on that night will be the carrier of satan baby the hour before new year of 2000 fortunately for the movie sake the girl grows up and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers subway trains in dark tunnels and myriad of inept nypd officers it an action film dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up imagine if the girl had lived in anytown usa where the only thing to destroy is dairy queen and post office arnold schwarzenegger jericho cane in series of boring events finds himself in the middle of religious battle between the church who is trying to hide the girl or in some cases trying to kill her and satan gabriel byrne who is trying to make her pregnant if the devil is successful the world will no longer exist as we know it jericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because he once had faith but no longer does and his wife and daughter were killed and he feels responsible for it jericho cane is your cliched by the numbers hero right up to his name arnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can he shouts at everyone from cops to priests to the devil in one truly hilarious scene which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point jericho screams to the devil you are @#$^% choir boy you are choir boy those two lines marked the high points of this film movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor end of days fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception of gabriel byrne byrne playing man who has been made the manifestation of the devil seems to be the only one who is having fun in this whole movie he wonderfully plays manipulative villain with the power to control everyone at any time the annoying thing about his character however is that he has the power to kill any human with simple punch in the face yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho and taken the girl from his custody the other actors in the film give very weak and unconvincing performances kevin pollak who plays the partner and close friend of jericho is the supposedly funny character in the film every action movie has one the one problem is that pollak does not deliver one funny line robin tunney plays the chosen mother of satan baby with extreme annoyance she gets no sympathy from any of the characters in the film except arnold who pretends she is his wife and daughter or any of the viewers in the audience in one unnecessary scene tunney walks out of her room and takes her top off is this her job in the film the actors are not to blame entirely because the script is terrible you can tell script is terrible when you are able to predict what will happen minutes before it does this little prediction game is very fun exception to trying to sit through this nonsense of movie in last attempt to make this movie good special effects are used to try to entertain the audience but without memorable action scene in the whole film the director has not done his job successfully this film would have gotten c+ if arnold stood in front of camera and shouted you are $@^@ choir boy for two hours
whether or not would be considered trekker probably depends on whom you would ask have been fan of both the original series and its recently retired follow up as well as the even numbered entries in the film series however have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs data somewhere along the line the star trek film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category and star trek generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction its production values may be high but the writing is frequently appalling and instead of script has collection of references in jokes and ill defined characters generations opens in the late 23rd century where members of the original enterprise crew including captain james kirk william shatner are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name no sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than distress signal brings them to the nexus mysterious ribbon of energy among those rescued from the nexus is long lived alien dr soran malcolm mcdowell but he is none too pleased at being back in the real world seventy eight years later soran is still trying to get back to the nexus and again encounters an enterprise this one led by captain jean luc picard patrick stewart soran plan involves destroying star with an inhabited planet and the only hope for saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains don think it is an insult to fans of star trek to suggest that to certain extent the particulars of plot are not really the most important elements in trek film it about chance to visit with old friends and if they are involved in truly interesting story it can be considered gravy but even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent and in generations that just doesn happen data brent spiner is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing in the film major sub plot data decides to use chip which will give him human emotions chip he has had in his possession for over year what is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step he doesn get joke once the chip is in place spiner gets to have lot of fun with data new emotions but the point is that he no longer the data we know if the rest of the next generation cast fares any better it only because they re on the screen so little that they re simply window dressing but then again this story isn really about the new crew it about kirk and picard the cowboy and the politician sharing the screen the huge surprise is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away perhaps because he knows this is his last go round in the part that made him legend shatner looks like he having the time of his life stewart on the other hand borders on the deferrential and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast stewart edginess is indicative of what may be very bad sign for paramount hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was these are clearly the not ready for big screen players by contrast the prologue which features scotty james doohan and chekhov walter koenig is the highlight of the film these characters have become part of the popular mythology and when they take over the enterprise in moment of distress it moment of high energy only thirty years of history can create moment like that and that time this new crew doesn have it certainly doesn help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again it also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in shared nudge of recognition wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the trek universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on and what waste of malcolm mcdowell who could have been great monomanical villain but should have been given much more compelling reason for his obsession there are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at but to do so would be to ignore generations major flaws however would like to make one recommendation seatbelts not just for the enterprise crew although you think by the 24th century space travel wouldn involve rolling around on the floor during battle no think the audience might need them more this journey is one bumpy ride
vikings bears no this isn the lineup for monday night football rather these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in the 13th warrior film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory based on michael crichton book eaters of the dead this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up sword luckily for the vikings however their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film antonio bandaras is ahmed travelling ambassador accompanied by his friend omar shariff in cameo they eventually come across small viking village we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude they laugh heartily revel in their arrogance and sing songs of battles won but their festivities are about to be halted when messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that great evil is threatening their land help is needed quickly an elderly fortune telling witch arrives after brief incantation she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more not of norse blood are needed to ensure victory personally always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity nonetheless 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives of course during their ride ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors but he ably shows that it not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings but will his skills and that of the group be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside it does not look promising these creatures resembling bears are strong and have high morale they are fearless and display desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods they are ready to sacrifice their lives this is good way to die says one of the fallen warriors despite the larger than life battle sequences was unmoved by the entire experience at many points was even confused for example somewhere in the middle of the film sub plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis however the sub plot never fully materializes and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion there are other questions that had but the real problem was that the story little of it that there was offered no characters to love or hate the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma however banderas role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order also much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night which made battles very difficult to follow would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy as it stands the film manages more confusion than intensity it would make thor cry
apparently when crap calls jim carrey answers here he is mugging it up in countless unfunny ways for the fifth time his second go around in the role of pet detective ace ventura that means more talking ass cracks penis jokes and cries of al lrighty then it all adds up to sequel that makes the original resemble schindler list in terms of dramatic merit or lack of granted there are few laughs amid the constant barrage of pre school humor but anyone who appreciates good comedy will bang their head against the wall ten times for every minor chuckle it painful experience for anyone with brain ace is distraught after accidentally dropping racoon into canyon in parody of the opening scene of sylvester stallone cliffhanger jim carrey being the only person who can make stallone look like college professor in terms of intellect or lack of and decides to retire to the mountains of tibet to gain higher level of consciousness or in his case level of consciousness but he is pulled out of retirement to the tune of $20 000 to retrieve sacred beyaz bat for an african tribe why africa so carrey can disguise himself nude inside fake rhino and later climb out the rear end as tourist family watches look the rhino about to give birth if that seems like hee haw humor to you by all means see the movie if not claim your place in human civilization with the rest of us obviously there are quite few nonmembers of civilization who made this movie like the first ace ventura film use the word film only because it was filmed not because there any level of artistic merit huge success in fact carrey only has career because of the decline of intelligence in our culture you may say to me but andrew look at jerry lewis he was born with negative and look how popular he was thirty years ago maybe but still say jerry lewis is notch or two up on the comedic ladder because he never actually did an impression in movie of rabid bulldog biting off man testicles lewis at least had the dignity to save that performance for when company came over
one of my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric you better watch out for the skin deep like to extend the same warning watch out for skin deep but whatever you do don watch skin deep skin deep is tedious and uneven comedy written and directed by blake edwards john ritter stars as zach dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with big time drinking problem never saw edwards comedy the man who loved women but have to wonder whether skin deep is remake you see to put it mildly zach goes to bed with just about each and every woman he meets as the movie opens zach wife alex catches him with not only his mistress but also his mistress hairdresser like any sensible wife alex kicks zach out of the house and divorces him in response zach goes on spiritual journey of drinking womanizing psychotherapy and self discovery if you re turned on by the idea of watching ritter drink get arrested have sex drink crash his mercedes have more sex drink get arrested again drink and sing horrendously at the piano then skin deep should be right up your alley skin deep makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable and unsympathetic characters zach is rich 80s version of ritter jack tripper character from three company like jack zach is clumsy and inept he the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye zach is supposed to be charming and charismatic but failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him consequently never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis in fact when zach crashes his ex wife wedding in desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony to add insult to injury edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing but stereotypes with which to work for instance vincent gardenia talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender of all the women in the film and there are many alyson reed alone stands out as zach wife reed brings intelligence and sensitivity to the role because we don care the slightest bit about anyone in skin deep the film few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail the comedy in skin deep doesn fare much better most of the jokes are dumb predictable and sitcomish about every ten minutes however edwards does manage to come up with good line or novel sight gag the most effective of which involves pair of dueling condoms overall the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat my final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol and alcoholism zach excessive drinking is clearly ruining his life but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain zach drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences if he crashes his mercedes he gets new one if he gets arrested his lawyer bails him out of jail if his wife leaves him she will eventually decide to give him second chance if he ll clean up his act the tone in skin deep is all wrong edwards treats very serious issue far too lightly making joke out of problem that is no joking matter perhaps edwards should have studied dudley moore in arthur or better yet michael keaton in clean and sober before making skin deep
this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground despite some good performances from basically competent cast eddie sean penn and maureen robin wright penn are not so happily married couple down on their luck living in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city they spend what little income they have at the local bar owned by shorty stanton eddie best friend and his wife georgie mazar maureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddie frequent disappearances on his return he promises her the world and professes his undying love their manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows as eddie disappears again like junky craving the next high maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high their relationship is further complicated by maureen pregnancy she wants the baby and the father but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter during one of eddie absences maureen is attacked by kiefer her neighbor who gets her drunk with her cooperation and then insists on intimacy she leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do not to her but to kiefer she lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage he lashes out as she expects and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be months but in reality is 10 years during this decade maureen divorces eddie and remarries more solid and reliable individual joey travolta in small role her life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her joey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband and father of two children and stability joey makes good living drives cadillac and they live in large house in the suburbs and the love of her previous life she chooses her past and sacrifices not only her new life but her old by giving up her and eddie daughter to joey but the eddie that she knew is gone replaced by mere shell of the man he was maureen is herself mere shell more an automaton than woman as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him perhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness or maybe the lack of sadness together but the movie denouement was not convincing
michael richards leaves his spot as kramer on the infamous seinfeld tv sitcom for stint as lanky goofy best friend to jeff daniels lawyer character in this ill fated and unfunny comedy plot richard the actor richards has to take the place of charles the lawyer daniels in real court case after charles is left unintelligible from night of heavy drinking at his bachelor party the film follows the antics of the two men as they try to get away with their tomfoolery critique this movie did not make me laugh once perhaps it was because was tired when watched it perhaps perhaps it was because had seen richards perform most of the same schtick thousand times on seinfeld perhaps perhaps it was because the movie just wasn funny absolutely the lack of humour wasn the only issue that had with this film either the movie attempts to weave couple of love stories through its vision but unfortunately they are also lacking in conviction believability and credibility they are contrived and appear to be placed into the story for convenience sake the actors were all adequate enough in their roles but the problem didn lie in the acting wish could find one good reason for you to see this waste of time but can unless of course you need something playing on your tv set while you waste some time around the house overall this movie stinks on the good side charlize theron is darn cute and the movie is no longer then 90 minutes on the bad side this movie is not funny interesting or enjoyable in any which way possible person wouldn even enjoy his nachos while watching this emptiness please skip it little known facts jonathan lynn earned degree in law from cambridge before becoming an actor director charlize theron grew up on farm outside benoni south africa as the only child at the age of 18 her mother made her go to los angeles to try career in the movie industry she came to la without knowing anyone in the city but after two weeks when she was standing in line on hollywood boulevard an agent gave her his card after eight months in la she got her first part since then she has taken acting lessons and her career has skyrocketed specifically in devil advocate 10 charlize was narrowly beat out by elizabeth berkley for the lead role in the movie showgirls she was quoted as saying it was like had some guardian angel
jackie chan kicks his way into van damme territory with twin dragons an embarrassingly bland action comedy of mistaken identities chan plays separated at births boomer and john ma whose drastically different paths aw forget the plot description it not even worth the space but let face it no one goes to jackie chan movies for the plot anyway the scenes where nothing happens in chan films have always been little more than glue thriftily spread to hold the action sequences together in the case of twin dragons however the tiresome plot driving scenes fritter away so much of the movie that you almost want to shout at the risk of demeaning the artistic value of cinema get to the good part already most of the film is devoted to showing the brothers efforts to hide the other existence from their own acquaintances why it is necessary to do this is not satisfactorily explained but neither are lot of aspects of the plot the twins love interests demure club singer barbara chan film regular maggie cheung and lusty bride hopeful tammy nina li chi get disoriented in all the brouhaha yet strangely seem not to mind that they are not sure which brother they are in love with the scenes describing the boys bumbling antics get stretched so thin we stop caring who chan is supposed to be in any given shot in several shots in fact even the make up and hair people seem to forget which brother is which even chan so corny it funny humor is off kilter in this outing some of the gags are so carefully innocuous they re annoying case in point whenever anyone sees the brothers together they fall to the ground in dead faint are we laughing yet as usual the final showdown is the film jewel tour de force display of chan agility and grace never mind that it not clear how the brothers end up fighting suited bad guys inside an automobile crash testing facility it all good fun but too little too late perhaps chan next movie should just be collection of the last fight sequences of all of his movies they could call it jackie chan the final fight scenes and everybody would go home happy reviewed april 14 1999 at loews theaters beyaz marsh beyaz marsh md
the general daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we ll see this year or perhaps the stupidest clever film it confusing to critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction that however is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller the punched up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general daughter has brain in its head even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense our hero is warrant officer paul brenner brash investigator for the army criminal investigation division his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell leslie stefanson at georgia base the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation complicating the case is the fact that capt campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell war hero and potential vice presidential nominee general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill madeleine stowe who coincidentally enough once had romantic relationship with brenner brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain past that make the case ever more sordid if only the sordidness were the worst of the general daughter problems scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered light sleaze director simon west likely thinks he covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches which is the film fatal flaw it trend he continues for two hours taking the story few virtues and slapping coat of moron proof obviousness over them characters who may wink wink turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow cutaway inserts of the captain campbell still living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five minute attention spans west just can help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general daughter he even turns scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow fade edits bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell mentor psychological warfare expert named moore james woods there something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another indeed travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures to the local sheriff of the georgia county shouldn you be out night sticking the colored folk even the lame device of brenner and sunhill sexual history provides few winning zingers goldman dialogue can serve up bigger laugh than you ll find in most so called comedies dialogue unfortunately just isn enough to make quality script it difficult to take movie about criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene and too lucky for it to last any longer not one but two occasions where brenner catches vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye by the time the general daughter wanders towards its over wrought psycho in the rain finale west heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun it silly and pretentious film making but at least it provides giggle or five goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into stand up routine
cradle will rock is the latest effort from director actor tim robbins while he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995 dead man walking he gets little overconfident and sloppy here the story is confusing and filled with many subplots so ll try my best and explain it as simply as possible the film is based on mostly true story about federal theater in the 1930s that produced play the cradle will rock that apparently was offensive to some so the government shuts it down it during the time of the depression and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs or are poor between this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots about those who work in theater or those associated also along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience tim robbin just keeps piling on political views and characters that we just give up on the film or in some cases walk out for robbin it may be nice achievement but to me it seemed more like friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue and fancy outfits thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast unfortunately are all uninteresting except for few let me recap what each important character does so please bear with me it the least you can do especially if you were considering seeing this ll begin with those involved with the play there orson welles angus macfadyen who of course is the director of the play the producer john houseman cary elwes marc blitzstein hank azaria the writer of the play emily watson woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock outside the play there the ventriloquist bill murray who wants relationship with federal theater clerk joan cusack another subplot involving painter diego rivera ruben blades who unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage john cusack there few other actresses and actors who have their own stories susan sarandon philip baker hall too name few but those that mentioned were the most significant to the story anyway most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted except for emily watson who does another great job and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack who always delivers through thick and thin now although most of the film was weak to say the least there were some nice moments and some involving subjects but all this is overblown sure the free speech segment was nice feature but not when it becomes repetitive the whole film is like this and it basically nothing but headache on the brighter side tim robbin direction was masterful his camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas anderson latest magnolia only smoother in my opinion but even that can make movie that much better although it has it moments not many of them but they re there cradle will rock stays true to it title because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over
disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life richard leonardo dicaprio sets off for thailand there he meets crazed man by the name of daffy robert carlyle who gives him map to beach secret utopia then commits suicide richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel tienne guillaume canet and fran oise virginie ledoyen once they get there the three discover secret society existing on this beach there richard falls for fran oise this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element which is solely creation of hollywood seems to hold to the original novel the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking don think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning but that is were many things go wrong darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking the plot of the movie moves along at decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts this is where the movie has some great potential then the three travelers get the island and there is turn for the better yes folks said better now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost un watchable there is even video game style sequence that borders on the disgusting it doesn make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion and am hoping many other peoples am hoping that in my little rant ve made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing so if you go see it and you don like it because of this don blame me the character development was not up to par either found the character of richard to be nothing more than spoiled child although there is feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard leo character comes off as wannabe philosopher the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason granted some people are like this myself included but nor anyone know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough richard is obviously obsessed by fran oise at the early stages of the story yet there is actually very little development along this story line this am sure contributes to the movie lack of core plot and being unfocused now shall move onto something little better about the movie for all you cynics out there the movie did have few good things about it the cast and acting was passable at the very least and think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard mind you think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much think this is topic all on its own so won get into it but like the fact that there was an international cast used had only and american cast been used can see this movie being horrible the international flavor added more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable not to mention the movie is set in thailand and global cast makes more sense when all is said and done liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable would not recommend this movie to anyone the fact that liked it has lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt if you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings
kate jennifer aniston is having some problems it appears the twenty eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired she learns that her problems are related as the owner of her advertising agency mr mercer kevin dunn explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company taking clients with her solution presents itself in nick jay mohr wedding videographer who kate meets through coincidence and gets photographed with kate boss darcy illeana douglas uses the photograph to fabricate wedding engagement between kate and nick kate is at first repulsed by the idea but after getting immediate positive results she pursues it her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc at dinner with kate bosses he will provoke fight and they will break up she meets nick to propose the plan he accepts kate new status brings unexpected results in other areas the office bad boy sam kevin bacon who wouldn give kate the time of day now does now that she is engaged he pursues an affair with her as doing so would destroy her good girl image hence sam sudden interest things start to fall apart for kate as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her and does not wish to break up with her after some provoking nick does oblige but problems continue for kate it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available or maybe kate does like nick but reconciliation will force her to admit her lies to her employer adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother olympia dukakis who wants her to get married and settle down there is scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is from the waist up only wearing bra it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer it like the director said well we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren that great so what the heck let show jennifer assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating quite frankly it insulting don think aniston is competent enough actress to carry movie she did decent enough job in ed burns she the one because it was smaller and supporting role and she just doesn deliver the goods effectively in this movie her performance was not convincing unfortunately as far as romantic comedies go this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies the film is similar to my best friends wedding in sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions gets no sympathy from me when things go awry didn care for how quickly kate puts down nick profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn glamorous enough for her co workers at least my best friends wedding changed the formula bit and had somewhat surprise ending no such luck with picture perfect every plot occurrence can be spotted mile away including couple that really made no sense after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first let alone consider relationship was quitting her job prerequisite to making amends with nick throw in the fact that don think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of decision believe that kate liked him but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away doubt it and what of the ending scene at wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers well guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars then that would make sense picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron kate jennifer aniston nick jay mohr sam kevin bacon mercer kevin dunn darcy illeana douglas rita olympia dukakis written by randy turgeon february 26 1998 visit my movie reviews www xtdl com ~canran
have you ever heard the one about movie so bad that it made guy run out of the theatre screaming obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment and so to finish us utterly they have now released urban legends final cut this is another scream like feature consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip offs from the most pointless movies of all time amy jennifer morrison is film student who is attending film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have clue about what to do but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university film program where each year best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize virtual one way ticket to hollywood success she has chance encounter with campus security guard reese loretta devine whose tale of series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at fictional thriller organized along similar lines soon enough fake and real blood starts to flow and amy is being chased around by scary killer while her cast and crew get slain one by one is the culprit the original urban legends murderer just some random psycho member of the faculty one of her competitors for the hitchcock or is there something even more stupid going on this is another one of those tiring pointless teen slasher flicks neither scary funny or interesting it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain the body counts and screams continue to grow as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly in fact watching films like that after having watched scary movie is impossible keeping serious face several times tried to prevent myself from laughing without succeeding and then realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing it the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century how many times must we tolerate the same clich that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them they are the most stupid meaningless predictable and soulless films in existence however director john ottman manages to make urban legends final cut into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre what was done with sense of redemption for past failures and irony in scream ottman takes seriously for that reason alone it is worth look just to realize how bad movie can be it tough to find comparisons for such an achievement and we have to dig in ancient history to find movie that would match its intellect even movies like lost in space and mission to mars seem spectacular in its shadow we have not seen such waste of ime and resources since showgirls 1995 no matter how hard tried to find positive elements in this so called production came up with nothing except the way the killer was dressed here feel that have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie sylvie deveu that have wisely replaced the well known scream mask with very elegant fencing mask jennifer morrison stir of echoes is all right and the other actors best achievement is keeping straight face when pronouncing the words from the script in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film with the exception of its screenplay is its portray of film schools if these graduates will be the directors of the future then hollywood golden days are over rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing third installment let just hope and pray that it just an urban legend
we are grateful that we have the songs of grace chan to comfort us starring lee kang sheng yang kuei mei directed by tsai ming liang written by tsai and yang ping ying cinematography by liao peng jung taiwan 24 12 99 the millenium approaches an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city sectors of the city are being sealed quarantined due to the onset of mysterious virus the virus causes people to act like insects they crawl about on all fours hide from bright lights huddle in damp corners the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in week time residents are advised to evacuate the area asap this premise kafka by way of cronenberg is the background for the hole which could have been great movie but sadly ends up as waste of good ideas the quick sketch above suggests dark absurd hallucinatory near future parable of life in the late 20th century in execution however it is nothing like that the virus the evacuation the visual possiblities of the deluge these are all relegated to the background instead the hole focuses on the lives for want of better word of man lee kang sheng and woman yang kuei mei who live in the same apartment building and who have no personalities the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile the charmless rooms and corridors of post industrial apartment complex photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible it vivid setting but an unappealing one especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background the man lives in the apartment directly above the woman one day repairman investigating leak leaves small hole in the floor of the man living room opening into the ceiling of the woman living room this hole symbol of the solitary opening in the character lonely compartmented lives allows them to interact in unusual and mostly non verbal ways example the man suffering from the onset of the virus or so assume everything is obscure in this movie vomits through the hole the woman wandering around in the dark accidentally puts her hand on his vomit and then cleans it up this is what passes for meaningful communication and they say romance is dead much of the film does not even focus on their interactions such as they are there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people they are ciphers instead we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives we watch for instance as the woman boils some water pours it onto some noodles then eats the noodles this is as fascinating as it sounds offered as counterpoint or perhaps relief to these dreary sequences are series of musical numbers fantasies in which the woman lip synchs to pop songs by grace chan popular so told in 1950s china she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights sometimes in these fantasies she is joined by the man these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality but they fail when the man and the woman dance it seems half hearted and listless astaire and rogers this is not even in imagination these people are numb weary boring the hole is part of the collection 2000 series group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium others include canada last night brazil midnight and american hal hartley the book of life the book of life is the only other one that have seen and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry witty energetic humane it makes the the hole seem ahem empty american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements quick cuts superficial emotions foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time and call it art the hole is self evidently film about alienation and perhaps director tsai ming liang wants the audience to share in his characters alienation if so he succeeds perhaps it is challenge he dares us to enjoy this movie despite his best attempts to ensure that we don if it was challenge wasn up for it
what happens when you put martin lawrence in fat suit in real life you get martin lawrence in coma the comedian thought he was getting fat so he put on numerous layers of heavy clothing and went jogging in 100 degree heat ending up in coma so what happens when you put martin lawrence in fat suit in the movies you get an audience in coma in big momma house lawrence plays fbi agent who master of disguises when naughty naughty man escapes from jail and seeks out his former girlfriend the very sexy nia long the only thing worth looking at in this movie she flees to georgia to stay with her rather large southern aunt big momma ella mitchell the fbi follows her in order to recover the large sum of money stolen in the bank robbery that sent the naughty man to jail however big momma is called away on an emergency sensing that they could lose their only chance to capture the criminal lawrence goes undercover as big momma and let the comedy begin big momma house is the definition of gimmick movie if there ever was one the plot can basically be summed up as martin lawrence dresses up as fat woman and even that description is too wordy you can just see this script plotted out on chalkboard with martin lawrence fat woman in the middle of the board with big circle around it and all sorts of clich humorous situations pointing to it fat woman plays basketball fat woman takes dump fat woman kung fu well they left one off the board movie critic slips into coma paul giamatti private parts the negotiator plays lawrence partner and as much as enjoy his work even he can inject life into this lifeless comedy hell the greatest performers on the planet couldn make this material work it just that awful
blatantly borrowing elements from 1993 like water for chocolate and 1991 the butcher wife simply irresistible attempts to be whimsical romantic comedy but more often than not comes off as laughable leaving you to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar buffy the vampire slayer would choose such an obviously inept film project to waste her time on things get off to bad start right from the onset as amanda sarah michelle gellar young woman who runs her late family struggling new york restaurant runs into mystery man who forces bushel of crabs on her and then vansihes into thin air while out shopping she also meets tom sean patrick flanery charming handsome man who happens to be planning ritzy restaurant for the department store he works for and later when he decides to drop by her dive called southern cross for lunch she somehow makes delicious crab dish for him even though she is known to not be very good chef suddenly amanda finds her restaurant on the edge of foreclosure rejuvenate to life as customer begin to swarm for her food which strangely causes everyone immediate jubilation when it hits their mouths are amanda and tom destined to be together and is it not just because of the magical food but because they really truly like each other and what exactly is going on with the food she is making does it have anything to do with that pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in the kitchen somehow assisting her in her food preparation simply irresistible is ridiculous and just plain goofy romantic fantasy that as flimsy as slice of bologna it takes one joke that people who eat the food are taken aback by it in most unusual ways and recycles it over and over again until the film has reached an appropriate running time of 95 minutes add in music montage every ten minutes these are actually the best scenes in the movie which certainly tells you something about the film itself and what you ve got is an utterly empty if not necessarily boring excursion the cast of simply irresistible is fairly good but it is the supporting characters who are the most interesting patricia clarkson 1998 high art in which she played drugged out lesbian is standout as tom colleague and is thankfully given few funny lines of dialogue also of note is larry gilliard jr as amanda cooking assistant and buddy who is allowed to create seemingly full character out of only handful of scenes of the main stars sarah michelle gellar is fine but really does often look like she struggling through the unmistakably clumsy material and if sean patrick flanery plans on keeping film career in the future he has certainly got to pick better projects than this the bottom line is that simply irresistible is the exact opposite of its deprophesized title and when the movie got to the point where the characters began to float in mid air an unamusing plot device that was repeated in the stupid last scene my mind checked out from the characters and the romance when think about it in hindsight should have checked out in the very first scene where the point of the action was for gellar to crawl under tables looking for runaway mechanical crab now that certainly is what call magical
wont even pretend that have seen the other alien films saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien but have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies was munching into after hard days work didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after minutes of painful viewing but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning sigourney weaver whos role in alien earned her an academy award nomination plays the character of ripley who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 200 years later scientists use sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley including the alien that was stuck inside her in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two yet ripley is now not completely human possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than normal being im sure someone can explain exactly why this is so but for now well just ignore it and move on why you ask would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated well the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature these were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research they yawn were wrong it doesnt take genius to figure out that the rest of the film is continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un flossed teeth theres little saying that goes something like this if youre going to make bad film do it well have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies but they are not the ones that really bother me alien resurrection good example of film that really gets up my nose is not so much discouraging experience but an off putting one there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore which attempts to distract us from the wandering but not going anywhere plot in one scene my stomach churned as witnessed mawkish looking alien put its hand on characters head and literally ripped most of his face off another one featured ripley sticking knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to fair enough if it were in horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story but this is unfortunately not the case and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable if you think im struggling to find one good aspect about the film then you thought right one exciting scene is credit and the only part remotely worth seeing to the film in which an alien chases two men one cripple up tall ladder with interesting results but of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis so in film where the one liners come as bad as earth man what shit hole and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent its no wonder why alien resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is oh and in case youre wondering about my bag of lollies the less enjoy film the more eat so all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes but however empty the bag turned out to be it was still long way ahead of the movie
synopsis lifelong friends rafe affleck and danny hartnett join the us air force and are stationed at pearl harbor hawaii rafe goes to england to fight alongside british pilots and is seemingly killed in action danny falls in love with rafe girlfriend evelyn beckinsale but rafe survives and returns to confront his former friend meanwhile the japanese sneak attack is imminent review pearl harbor is perfect example of movies as product rather than as art it is little more than crassly calculated attempt to woo the masses enticing them with big stars big effects and big setting but no heart it is difficult to criticise the actors because they do everything the movie demands of them sadly this amounts to barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to see the script randall wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he was writing pearl harbor with his left the plot here is pure cliche and the wartime setting simply convenient backdrop there is no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to the united states and no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join world war ii instead there is just an assembly line love triangle some empty patriotic rhetoric and laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders when one intones fear all we have done is to awaken sleeping giant nearly fell out of my seat to the movie credit it does include fantastic portrayal of the attack itself an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges viewers into the war if only the remaining two hours had been crafted with such skill perhaps this memorial day non event would have been worth watching
this is film that was inclined to like at the outset the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st elsewhere for several years and had understood that the director screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations nor were they satisfactory if had to list reason why but that would be getting ahead of myself besides it not immediately clear as there are so many problems with the film adam arkin plays grade school teacher who is sardonic cynical and somewhat abrasive but good teacher he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on nearby court one day he meets drifter david morse who plays jack morrison on st elsewhere in the park and inveigles him in game of one on one basketball morse turns out to be good and friendship slowly develops between the two as their respective professions progress on the screen arkin teaching and morse selling of paper flowers to passing motorists so far my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack good music to be sure but it doesn replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story it makes the film somewhat minimalistic technique rarely admire suddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse introduction to fellow teacher of arkin woman arkin has long admired from afar but it too reticent to approach it appears that she begins to admire morse who enjoys here attentions but isn sure what to do about it she doesn realize that he is drifter and knows nothing about his past and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else until then had only vague dissatisfaction with the film the conclusion is where it begins to evolve into full fledged failure the woman at least to me appeared to be fairly shallow didn realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse somehow this is made to appear as if it is arkin fault and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he gotten such find of girlfriend frankly dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make punching her in the mouth not the least after this the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural if had to summarize major gripe it that this is story spread too thin that creates semi likable characters at the outset and then suddenly jerks them into being 16 year olds at the last moment it might be true to life with some people but that doesn mean have to like it don avoid
love movies really do every time watch great movies like goodfellas 1990 or raiders of the lost ark 1981 tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent skill and entertainment that is on display even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1994 or ghostbusters ii 1988 while not exactly brilliantly well made are certainly not waste of celluloid and present entertainment value then there my favourite martian the exact opposite of what movie should be hurried poorly written and acted movie with one goal to make money disney ever since the lion king 1994 have lost their magic touch but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk christopher lloyd plays martian who crash lands in front of reporter tim hara car daniels and soon tim finds the martian in his home trying to recover and fix his spaceship along with his zoot spacesuit voiced by wayne knight must fix his spaceship before it explodes and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public firstly by hara but later by rival presenter brace channing hurley by calling himself tim uncle martin laughter is supposed to arise from the comical events but never does many bad films have good intentions but my favourite martian doesn appear to try to provide any entertainment filled to the brim with wham bang special effects my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie ve never seen man pull face for 93 minutes until now jeff daniels plays staple nice guy and his role is useless his performance is incredibly lazy although his paperthin character doesn deserve more than the performance he gives darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever but her role is somewhat erm limited hurley mistakes acting for shouting and looking like twit and wins the david wilcock award for most irritating godawful performance in moving picture way to go liz for the supporting cast disney manage to assemble every character actor out there during the film was going he was the guy in ah er before finally giving up and switching off another major setback is the staple comedy sidekick unfortunately the writers sherri stoner and deanna oliver if anyone cares forget that comedy sidekick needs to be funny instead they deliver zoot the martians deeply unfunny sidekick although meant to be manic character no doubt every line that comes out of his neck is dud real dud citizen kane delivers more laughs minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character not one child even bothered to smirk it nice special effect though another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves or rather the lack of them my favourite martian reaches new level of toilet humour it goes past the bowl down the pipe and into the sewer now toilet humour can be funny as dumb and dumber 1994 humorously showed but here characters farting belching and almost getting crapped on literally is not amusing it insulting there one good gag right before the credits but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued either that or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldn mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes yes men at work yowza the fact that lot of money was pumped into this film and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more there are thousands of brilliant films out there that can get distribution yet trash like this gets released nation wide with ease thankfully as soon as it makes it money it will never be seen again and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie down the toilet
looked at the internet movie database awards section for this film and found that this was nominated for golden globe for best picture drama anyone who seen this film can back me up on this this is the worst of the great disaster films and that not really saying lot for this film earthquake is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured on video it bland and slow moving film which gives us bunch of different characters the disaster film requisite then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster while this worked in say the towering inferno it doesn here for one single reason we don care about any of the characters the film gives us charlton heston in one of many crap 70s films he made including skyjacked and that classic soylent green as rich man married to ava gardner who is having little affair with young single mom genieveve bujold renegade police officer on suspension george kennedy in his least humored performance in the second weirdest subplot motorcycle stuntman richard roundtree right after his shaft thing whose big stunt is he goes on little track that goes upside down yea snore and the weirdest subplot military man bag boy at grocery store who has little thing for buxom victoria principal and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair in smaller subplots there pointless bit about people who are flying over the city in the film by the way one who playing cards and married to boring non acting husband you think this one can go nowhere guess again he gets interested in the final frames there genieveve bujold moron son who has little adventure with wires and for some much needed comedy there walter matthau billed as walter mutha the only laugh in the film as wild drunkard who big moment is dance he does at critical time as for the actual earthquake it rather let down there full hour of character setups none of which is interesting then about 10 minutes of shaking crumbling and bit where house almost falls on bujold narrowly missing this film needed that whole theatre shaking they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored there little suspense following the quake although this film tries for it there an adventure in crumbling high rise office building the wires with the kid and the movement of people who are all injured but none of these are all too suspenseful the finale with the heston gardner bujold love triangle is ended in basic flip of the coin bit which brings out big let down and there no real finale even volcano ended nicely and that movie really sucked not only is it hokey but you don care about any character who cares if heston dies who cares if he choses bujold or gardner although would have chosen gardner mainly on the basis that she can actually act who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid stunt who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires and who cares about that whole plane spiel if anything earthquake is worth viewing for the same reason glen or glenda is mean laughed at this more than did at bio dome but that another story and review in short earthquake gives disaster pics bad name
my giant begins with monologue that more funny than not and distinctive `princess bride medieval fairy tale in the 90s feel was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was with very funny scenes occurring on movie set in romania where talent agent sammy billy crystal is visiting client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into stream and when sammy meets max his giant mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan there is magic in the air albeit it bit goofy loved every minute of it the film of course plays on the size difference between the two and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects particularly enjoyed shot of sammy dangling his legs from max sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons also liked jere burns from tv `something so right performance as the director of the film in romania at this point the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand particularly during his fast paced first scene it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate as did understand him more as the film continued and became accustomed to his speech however about the time muresan becomes coherent the characters head to new york and the film takes dive off the high board suddenly we are expected to believe sammy is do whatever it takes slime ball up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure but he didn come off as desperate jerk if he had the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical but now in new york we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son and his character is desperate enough to involve max in disturbing giant vs midgets wrestling match which found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film indeed many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal when sammy gets max role in big hollywood movie filming in las vegas while enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation rather than because the film demanded it and the audience is required to take huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare at this point found myself thinking `we re supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in film then realized he was and was watching it in the final third the film undergoes another transformation this time to unbridled sentimentality note major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love lillianna who hasn seen him since he was normal sized kid her refusal to see max unbeknownst to him leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means scene as sammy wife serena played nicely by kathleen quinlan poses as lillianna found this scene offensive not only did it rely on deception to induce warm fuzzy feelings from the audience it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle which thought was quite undeserved think max could have handled the truth gratuitous illness and all late in the film we learn max and in fact all giants have heart condition which shortens their lives considerably this could be an enlightening revelation but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy transformation into caring sensitive guy and hey great dad and husband too `my giant suffers from poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy struggles to get money and become better person in this scenario max illness could have been integral part of the film not story motivator sentiment and emotion would have followed naturally instead we re apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end but we re not allowed to focus on max crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances but in the end `my giant left me feeling like been fed gruel from giant spoon
alexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft played character of dashing swordsman artagnon in director peter hyam adventure the musketeer for some reason that may figure out later don know why the time money and effort were put into the making of the musketeer it may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this film xin xin xiong once upon time in china and yuen woo ping from crouching tiger hidden dragon the result is mix of genres that don mesh well elements of the ritz brothers style comedy for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939 the three musketeers the man with no name from fistful of dollars artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the matrix crowd alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters the real problem with the the musketeer lies in the casting of the two lead romantically intertwined characters artagnan and francesca mena suvari chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character la chris donnell but lacks any onscreen charisma suvari has the doe eyed pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen but she too does not have the chemistry to command the screen if the musketeer makes them any money they should invest in acting lessons stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one the supporting cast is on the surface impressive catherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty dignity and humor especially when she plays off of artagnan mentor planchet jean pierre castaldi who reminds of andre the giant in the princess bride stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu but is given very little to help flesh out his character tim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal chief henchman febre he is so bad he makes simon legree look like boy scout the rest of the players particularly the three musketeers aramis nick moran lock stock and two smoking barrels porthos steve spiers and athos jan gregor kremp are background fodder whose role is to come to artagnan aid when needed peter hyam does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions artagnan takes on tavern full of thugs and bests them single handed he fights gang of febre henchmen aboard speeding coach to protect the queen with the obligatory branches hanging over the road he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy febre who murdered artagnan folks years before it is all routine stuff the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap defying gravity up walls and from horse to horse it works in sci fi film like the matrix or in classical fantasy like crouching tiger hidden dragon but just calls attention to itself in the musketeer at one point could swear saw the stunt wire being used it did not make me believer and am very disappointed with run time of 106 minutes it should have been more like 80 and give it
in my opinion movie reviewer most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion but with soul survivors so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into venomous uncontrollable rant obligations damned however protocol forces me to do otherwise soul survivors tells the story of four college bound friends cassandra melissa sagemiller is sweet and innocent party girl annabel eliza dushku of bring it on is dating world weary harvard student matt wes bentley matt still has feelings for cassie who is now dating sean casey affleck driving back from creepy gothic party the quartet gets into horrific car crash sean dies leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her as cassie mopes through her classes she sees the ghost of sean all over the place urging her to follow him along with being plagued by other ghastly visions cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party annabel and matt try calming her down but no one shares cass visions she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself rarely have seen director so thoroughly mishandle material in his directorial debut steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion when the movie camerawork isn pedestrian it clich carpenter need for close ups his camera following sagemiller from behind drain the movie of any anticipation we already know what to look for so why should we be surprised and the sense of scary atmosphere which was recently done so well in the others is nowhere to be found here carpenter script relies on random twists and turns with minimum of logic and loads of laziness this is movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around the second lamest device of course is the oh it was all dream resolution and guess what this movie has both not that the main body of the film which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having nervous breakdown is anything worthwhile since there no captivating dialogue no character chemistry exists anywhere that huge problem since the four main characters are supposed to be couples carpenter can even get the smutty scenes right which are becoming more prevalent in pg 13 movies like bring it on and get over it [the film was recently re cut from an rating to get more kids in the seats ed when sagemiller and dushku dance together at club he rarely shows them in full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than second before relating to some michael bay style quick cuts and when sagemiller and dushku take shower together after getting covered in paint they re fully clothed regardless any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity why wouldn they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine why would they shower in their clothes what if they weren covered in latex paint the cast which will see better material in the future would be wise to leave this one off their resumes felt sorry for affleck who ve liked in other movies and bentley who was great in american beauty dushku who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan as for sagemiller star of the aforementioned get over it want to see her in movie where she plays person and not an object for gawking and not even getting into luke wilson role as priest at least he friends with wes anderson bottom line soul survivors is so awful feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it
reading the cast and director for the new mobster comedy analyze this asked myself how could this miss robert de niro taxi driver raging bull billy crystal city slickers lisa kudrow the opposite of sex and director harold ramis national lampoon vacation these are usually reliable filmmakers well okay crystal has been in sizable slump lately and tellingly the first half hour of analyze this was very funny unfortunately as the running time ticked away began to think that the first thirty minutes had unbeknownst to me been rewound and were being replayed another two and half times the film has obtained clever premise but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more and more repetitive until finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen middle aged psychoanalyst ben sobel billy crystal life is finally going very well although he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents especially his father who is also psychiatrist ben has an easy going teenage son kyle sabihy and is about to travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend laura lisa kudrow in little but flash however ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently gets paid visit from famed mafia guy paul vitti robert de niro who desperately wants counseling even though he himself won even admit to having anxiety attacks ben tries to help paul mostly so he will get him off his back but the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding which ends with man dropping eight stories to his death it seems to ben that no matter what he does paul vitti will not go away and the more they become involved the more ben potentially happy life gets into danger analyze this has few laughs sprinkled throughout mostly in the first half but always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan ramis and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106 minute running time admittedly de niro is very funny here and can remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe him and crystal is in top form but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them including substantial plotline since analyze this bills not one not two but three writers you think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws but they must have all been on auto pilot one of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters all of which have next to nothing to do and aren even given multi dimensional characters to attempt to develop coming off of her oscar caliber work in two of last year best films clockwatchers and the opposite of sex lisa kudrow throwaway girlfriend role is an incredible step down sure kudrow fellow friend jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in office space but at least we got to spend little time with aniston kudrow meanwhile mostly just stands around no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place chazz palminteri as rival gangster primo fares even worse in role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character finally molly shannon rising film star and cast member on saturday night live has rousingly hilarious one scene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystal patients and then completely disappears too bad considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro and crystal once analyze this approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow laura standing alone at the altar once again had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most ben afterwards the climactic scene with ben posing as fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul became real laugh free dead zone losing its last remaining comic punches analyze this proves that talent can certainly help any film out but when the written material isn up to their level what we are virtually left with is vacuum of thin air
as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment hollywood doesn loose the oppertunity to get involved by telling stories and expressing opinions this film centers on relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels hays hodges tommy lee jones and terry childers samuel jackson they fought side by side in vietnam where childers saved hodges life by shooting an unarmed pow that against the rules of war but understandable in this story anyway under the specific circumstances certainly hodges is not complaining years pass hodges whose wounds make him unfit for action gets law degree and becomes marine lawyer childers is now respected and much decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould because of his excellent record childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ben kingsley cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops childers does what he has to do evacuate the family and protect the men under his command after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd more than 80 yemeni men women and children are mowed down childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on crowd and murder of unarmed civilians he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film did childers violate authorized military rules of engagement or are there simply no rules in war the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions the murder of 83 innocent civilians has to result into something greater than simple trial in the where is the accusations from the arab leaders where is the the film ends without even telling the most interesting story what happens on the international arena this film in way akin to films such as few good men has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism these accusations are pretty heavy but also unfair what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking one of the earliest apparent problems with rules of engagement is its lack of credibility the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now but is overdone contrived and unrealistic as if chain of events had to happen in particular manner in order for the plot to proceed lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality that is precisely why it not offensive it is completely unobjective many stories are started and never finished many questions are asked but never answered lot of parallels are referring to nothing it seems that neither the director producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film is it about arab mentality america foreign policies america role in the world corruption in the higher circles it goes on and on it consists of countless stories but not definable plot it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one think that it is ironic because director william friedkin probably most acclaimed film was the exorcist which had silly story but became rather effective film in this case you have strong story with many possibilities and the result is silly film though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism such as the impressive battle scenes his latest film does simply not engage believe that friedklin is director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed it obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore catastrophe the characters feel designed unreal merely shadows with no life outside the conflict even the actors can not save this film from going under though both jackson and jones act admirably with performances that are as good as you get with script like this it is not something that these great actors can boast of they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back jackson is gray and jones uninteresting the rest of the cast including ben kingsly blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks the time has come for the verdict on the charges of complete lack of objectivity find this film guilty on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking find it guilty but on the charges of racism find this film not guilty because of it inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere not only when concerning the arab population must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went bit too far portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad guys this is very sad since in time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth however it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states and that it not coincidence that residents in the middle east including yemen are on constant maximum alert

plot little boy born in east germany named hansel loves the american music one day he gets the opportunity to meet and marry an american but first he must get sex change enter hedwig once married the two move to the states but quickly thereafter get divorce at that point hedwig starts writing music and meets another confused boy who soon turns into star that boy also turns his back on hedwig and it isn long before hedwig puts together his her own band and tours the states via seafood restaurants this is the story of his her life told via flashbacks and musical numbers critique an artsy fartsy musical with great songs and superb performance by john cameron mitchell doesn really come together as whole with over the top symbolism incoherence and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through in fact this isn so much of realistic articulate behind the scenes look at the rise of rock roll star as it is an ambiguous overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of man his sexuality and his identity as whole person on this planet guess that was expecting the former going in the film is somewhat interesting to point but was personally never able to involve myself too much as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant but it is definitely tuned to certain type of audience chances are that if you are fan of the wall the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla queen of the desert the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy some of the characters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point and provide the lyrics of their song on screen well personally don care for those films and didn really get into the whole show atmosphere of this movie either guess might ve looked at it all too literally but like said earlier just didn care enough about the characters to delve into the so the butterfly represents his freedom side of things all know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and didn make me feel any more fulfilled what was hedwig relationship with that other member of his band with the beard what happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie was that an actual sequence or fantasy what ever happened to the lawsuit and more all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his her sexuality then that one thing but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie wanted some resolution to those pieces as well didn get it the film humor also didn tickle my funny bone either then again ve seen many film in these art house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter while all see is tiny bit of whimsy on the screen some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added atmosphere of plant called marijuana and can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements in order to jazz up that experience but being sober as was and expecting coherent funny musical with transsexual twist didn leave the theater very satisfied came out having watched an existential story of confused man caught up in musical lifestyle wrapped in metaphors dramatics and more questions than answers will on the other hand definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film john cameron mitchell who is also the man who wrote directed and created the play on which this movie is based and the tunes which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols david bowie and the whole 70s glam rock scene note btw it seems as though pretty much every single mainstream critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom and thought that it was really funny to boot so you might want to take that into consideration yourself but having said that the main reason that started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the official critics while regular joblo in the audience just wouldn get what all the fuss was about this movie is perfect example of why continue to write movie reviews where joblo coming from moulin rouge 10 grease 10 everyone says love you 10 the opposite of sex 10 dancer in the dark 10 brother where art thou 10 love labour lost 10
8mm is not going to enlighten your day it dark grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess you ll require lot of patience as well nicolas cage seems to be doing quite bit of overacting as of late he wore bizarre get up and did lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes and here he attempts performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality cage plays private investigator tom welles praised for his secrecy and reliability at home welles is family man with wife catherine keener and small daughter to take care of his new assignment is bizarre one the wife of formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve mystery regarding film found in her husband safe the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving teenage girl and masked man until the girl is brutally murdered or so it seems welles of course begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth and the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case the more he gets in over his head he hires an adult book store clerk named max california joaquin phoenix to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography max knows what welles is getting himself into and explains `you dance with the devil the devil don change the devil changes you these turn out to be very wise words 8mm has premise that begs for better execution the set up is slick and well played as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her this is where everything goes awry although director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the `real world he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula everything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects although it had enormous potential the third act of 8mm is total bust leaving intrigued audiences in baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control cage is the film sole flame of energy his performance is actually believable but soon the director demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation still you ve got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand welles trail soon leads him to bizarre filmmaker played convincingly by peter stormare who is notorious for the hardest hitting snuff films in the industry this is where cage goes over the edge into serial killer like phase in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film he tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing chris bauer and they have bloody brawl in the local cemetery fight sequence that would look more at home in schwarzenegger movie written by andrew kevin walker 8mm dissipates into poor man seven with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such chilling masterpiece furthermore what has become of joel schumacher the director has recently experienced major drought slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop batman and robin anyone this putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side
synopsis original jurassic park survivor alan grant neill is tricked by paul and amanda kirby macy and leoni into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur to rescue their stranded son grant team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought review there is one reason why jurassic park iii is better than its immediate predecessor the lost world jurassic park the latter wasted 129 minutes of my life the former only 94 the first park was marvellous film full of awe inspiring sights interesting characters and genuine thrills its two successors have been pale imitations amounting to hundred million dollar grade horror movies at least this third entry realises it whereas the lost world tried to justify its existence with ludicrous and overextended plot jurassic park iii simply sticks its characters on an island with bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin there is desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie the computer animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting and even the first time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation remember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie nothing in this rehash even comes close add in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman payne and taylor and phoned in performances by the normally capable macy and leoni and it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts at least neill makes some effort to retain the dignity of his character and there is much less gore than in the lost world making this installment more suitable for children
take two old and dying men lifetime of regrets house full of sins thoroughly despicable man enough lies insecurities and other character defects to keep team of psychiatrists gainfully employed then add inexplicable meteorological and amphibian based phenomenon and you will have summed up magnolia the newest film from paul thomas anderson boogie nights the movie tells multiple stories weaving them together or overlapping them during the course of its three hour running time would that the stories were worth the telling earl partridge jason robards thousand acres is dying of cancer bedridden in much pain it is obvious that his time is growing short his much younger wife played by julianne moore an ideal husband is surprised to find herself struggling with his impending death having married for money she discovers that she has actually fallen in love with the old guy and regrets having cheated and lied earl regrets having cheated on his first wife and estranging himself from his only son tom cruise eyes wide shut now misogynist self help guru who teaches men how to seduce and destroy his sexual and vulgar perspective on male female relationships is so over the top as to be utterly unbelievable meanwhile jimmy gator philip baker hall the insider is also dying of cancer not as physically incapacitated as earl jimmy is still able to perform his duties as the lovable host of long running quiz show which pits adults against children the current whiz quiz kid is stanley spector jeremy blackman in his film debut who is tired of the pressure of performing and is willing to call it quits on the other hand quiz kid donnie smith william macy mystery men would like nothing more than to return to the spotlight when he was somebody his pathetic life is souring as he can no longer capitalize on his brief 15 minutes of fame which stanley is all too eager to relinquish jimmy has his own family crisis as his drug addict daughter melora walters boogie nights refuses to have anything to do with him for reasons which are not disclosed to us until the end of the film grabbing at one last attempt at happiness she reaches out to softhearted cop john reilly never been kissed even as she tries to push herself away from him because she deems herself not worthy of his affection this dysfunctional group carries on for what seems to be an interminable two thirds of the movie and then it gets worse literally raining frogs yes frogs assuming it to be an intended deus ex machina device it is an ineffective one because it doesn seem to faze the characters much oh they may step gingerly around the splattered frog corpses littering the streets but otherwise the frog shower didn seem to change their behavior or pattern of living or dying there is simply too much going on in this movie and most of it is distasteful to watch mr anderson further obscures the film by incorporating loud and intrusive sound track that often drowned out the dialogue character who apparently rapped significant clue to plot development which was completely unintelligble and heavy handed segment of historical occurances containing ironic twists which set up absolutely nothing one of the recurring themes is found in line donnie quotes we may be done with the past but the past is not done with us this is an absolute lie god is in the forgiveness business in fact as we humbly ask for forgiveness and repent or change our offending mindset god word says that he not only forgives he also forgets even am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake and will not remember thy sins isaiah 43 25 [kjv] the spiritual one who keeps bringing up our unrighteous past is the same one who wants to keep us in state of condemnation don let him next time your spiritual adversary reminds you of your past take great pleasure in reminding him of his future he hates that
around the end of 1998 japanese cartoon came to the usa television and really wasn that big in fact not many people even knew what pokemon was but in 1999 it hit big with kids and adults alike and became one of the biggest franchises and merchandise seller of all time in fact it even spawned big screen adventure pokemon the first movie which for what it was wasn all that bad it grossed $31 million in its opening weekend and went on to make almost $90 million fans thought it was great and now is second movie in the pokemon craze pokemon the movie 2000 which is far inferior to the original animated movie first up is the plot which there really isn much of in fact the plot what there is bad guy trying to destroy the ancient never before seen pokemon lugia is about it except the fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever well there you go of course ash is followed by his friends misty brock gary and his pokemon friends pikachu squirtle charizard the usual even though the first movie wasn great film it was definately an enjoyable well made movie with an actual thin storyline this new movie however is nothing but garbage there is nothing good to it storywise and its only good thing comes from some plush animation and colors compared to the first film this movie is awfully bland from its opening titles to the end titles it tries its best to work but fails miserably at every corner the characters are dimensional the story thin as chicken broth and the writing very lame even the so called action scenes are extremely lame and falls before it even gets chance to go the voices even aren that good and almost feels like the stars don want to be there like they can tell that this is an extremel bad movie which it certainly is the film has one thing going for it and that is the animation although not up to disney standards it is still very good with some interesting cgi and very colorful animation the colors jump out at you very fast and seem very nicely put on film why film this bad got such good treatment with its animation is still question to be answered hopefully pokemon next year will be much better than this trash for now watch the first one its much much better
its stupid little movie that trys to be clever and sophisticated yet trys bit too hard with the voices of woody allen gene hackman jennifer lopez sylvester stallone and sharon stone this computer animated yak fest think toy story [1996] filled with used merchandising is one for the ant eaters the main story is the independence of worker named allen he wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony when he finds out about ``insectopia mythical place where all insects can run free along with his colony princess stone journey out into the world to find meaning for life about 15 minutes into the picture began to wonder what the point of the film was halfway through still didn have an answer by the end credits just gave up and ran out antz is mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice overs allen is nonchalant while would have guessed if hadn seen her in the mighty and basic instinct stone can act even in cartoon this film is one for the bugs unfunny and extremely dull hey bug life may have good time doing antz in

after the recent animated debacles of rugrats movie and bug life am seriously considering raising my highly negative rating on dreamworks other insect film from october antz hated that movie and yet it is so much better than these latest two excursions bug life is the second animated insect film in the last two months and hoped for the best considering it was done in the wonderful style of pixar last film 1995 toy story but in no way does bug life even remotely match up to that flik david foley an ant who along with his many comrades has the job every year of gathering up the seasonal harvest only to have to give half of it away to the dominating grasshoppers led by hopper kevin spacey flik however feels all alone and unwanted in the world especially after he accidentally loses all of their food and the ants are threated by hopper to gather up whole other season load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees banished from ant island flik leaves the colony in search of some strong reinforcement to help out but through misunderstanding returns with handful of helpless circus bugs including walking stick david hyde pierce dung beetle brad garrett gypsy moth madeline kahn male ladybug denis leary and caterpillar joe ranft bug life has one thing going for it only one thing with its glorious bright colors the computer generated animation is spectacle to look at the film itself unfortunately is lifeless unamusing contraption without any of the flair or excitement of toy story the characters in bug life are an assortment of either unlikable or dull insects without any charm or personality other than to stand around and recite arbitrary and thoroughly unfunny one liners the thin story was also stretched out to nearly unbearable 94 minutes and it often felt as if they ran out of ideas throughout and so they made up pointless scenes to pass as time filler after giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from this year was beginning to think that had simply outgrown them but then realized this is just not so still adore almost all of the older disney films and many of the newer ones such as 1989 the little mermaid 1991 beauty and the beast 1993 the nightmare before christmas and yes 1995 toy story maybe this has just been bad year for children films and hopefully the upcoming the prince of egypt will not be disappointment as for bug life did not enjoy anything about it not the story not the characters and not even the voiceover work which was far more lively in antz bug life goes down as yet another failure for disney and it is sad state of affairs when their best film in the last two years has been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture ll be home for christmas
once upon time jean claude van damme was decent action hero the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films boasting his spectacular martial arts ability some of these excursions were fun but now it seems like watching van damme movie has become painful chore with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mind numbing action and when the action goes sour what is there left to enjoy ll explain knock off is about pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong marcus ray van damme babe magnet and stylish dresser heads up the company with an annoying weasel of partner rob schneider they become part of plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans seemingly by mole in the business going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph so if you want review devoid of spoilers skip onto the next one not quite sure who gives crap but ll issue warning anyhow tommy is really working with the cia his boss very hammy and flat paul sorvino is the mole and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons he even stoops so low to put them into children toys if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing then you probably will enjoy knock off if you think that this ridiculous set up couldn even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing this might not be your cup of tea knock off sucks it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something simply because van damme is the star the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind the performances are so wooden you could use them to row canoe and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe director tsui hark who teamed with van damme in the superior but still lame brained double team is at the helm and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot suppose enjoyed some of the camera work but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence speeds are altered consistently and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired it all sounds very cool trust me it isn as much as it scars me to say this har har van damme is terrible sure he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease he looks like he doing bad impersonation of jackie chan and his performance is stiff and tired hate to say it but perhaps it time for mr van damme to give up his day job it really test of endurance watching knock off suppose there some enjoyment derived from schneider character who is extremely annoying but provides the film better moments and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter knock off doesn even stand strong as mindless but entertaining action film like handful of van damme others no this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department that is certainly not saying much note to self avoid universal soldier the return upon release in august 99
the year is barely week old and there is already candidate for the worst of 1997 the relic would be chiller that more successful at making the audience laugh than scream in this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams whose last two pictures were dreadful jean claude van damme vehicles creature that feeds on the hypothalamuses hypothalamii of humans and animals goes on killing spree in chicago museum how did this creature come into existence and why does it feed on hormones the scientific explanation cooked up by the four yes four credited screenwriters amy holden jones john raffo rick jaffa and amanda silver takes suspension of disbelief to new heights even by monster movie standards but as cockamamie as the science is in the film it isn quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears give it up penelope it _monster_movie_ on the flip side tom sizemore just phones in his performance as police lieutenant but his role is so thankless that it hard to imagine it being played any more effectively it quite funny to see film indulge with the straightest of faces in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well and so recently in scream for example in one early scene museum security guard goes into bathroom stall late at night ok we all know what coming but as if we didn need any more confirmation he pulls out joint and starts puffing away everyone knows what happens to people who do drugs in scary movie and later miller frantically runs out of museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing does she make beeline for the front door of course not she runs into the ladies room and cowers in stall with all the cliches it is only fitting the film climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film that of someone outrunning fireball if the relic is truly the next evolution in terror as the poster states then the horror film and humanity is in even worse shape than we thought
susan granger review of two can play that game screen gems since the success of waiting to exhale there have been several romantic comedies about african american professionals this female revenge fantasy vivica fox plays shante smith stunning ad exec who seems to have reached the pinnacle of success mansion sporty car and an idyllic relationship with hunky hot shot lawyer morris chestnut she at point in her life when she dispenses advice to her grateful girl friends mo nique wendy racquel robinson tamala jones when your man messes up no matter how small it is she smugly decrees yuh gots to punish him so when she catches her hot man dancing at bar with smart and sexy rival gabrielle union she devises her own version of the rules 10 day tough love emotionally punishing plan to get him back unfortunately writer director mark brown how to be player breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy you have to like the protagonist and shrill self congratulatory shante smith is smirking superficial spiteful shrew who doesn realize that rational rules cannot always be applied to love having her talk directly into the camera gets stale very quickly and the day one day two title card device underscores the tedium comic anthony anderson scores as chestnut boisterous best friend and singer bobby brown does cameo as scuzzy mechanic who given smooth makeover by ms robinson but the out takes over the closing credits contain more humor than the film itself on the granger movie gauge of to 10 two can play that game is smarmy if slick filled with misogynistic attitude and blatant product placements coca cola miller genuine draft but little else in this rated for explicit sexual language pseudo hip battle of the sexes the audience loses
susan granger review of glitter 20th century fox there less here than meets the eye or put it this way if you thought madonna was awful in shanghai surprise mariah carey worse in this reworking of star is born she plays billie frank who despite being abandoned by her singer alcoholic mother valerie pettiford believes she destined for greatness because everyone tells her she is you ve got this amazing gift and you gotta use it her roommate says your voice it incredible says another singer ain never met anyone like you proclaims julian dice siyah max beesley the hot new york dj who becomes her svengali like producer lover problem is her signature song didn mean to turn you on is wretched and when she fumes out of filming her first music video because the director wants to exploit her by having her wear bikini the audience bursts into laughter exploit mariah carey who chooses to wear as little as the law will allow come on writer kate lanier script is fatuous and director vondie curtis hall doesn have clue how to handle the glitzy pop diva and as result of their incompetence whispery voice ms carey seems to be embarrassed on screen she almost cringes when the camera comes in for close up pursing her lips and averting her glassy eyes talented british musician max beesley appears equally inept and as cinematographer geoffrey simpson pans around the manhattan skyline there an audible audience groan when the twin towers of the world trade center come into view perhaps one of the reasons ms carey suffered her highly publicized nervous breakdown this summer is because she saw preview of this clunker on the granger movie gauge of to 10 glitter is pathetic right now it tops on my list of the worst of 2001
the ads make hanging up seem like an upbeat comedy about rascally father and his three daughters anyone who went to the movie expecting that left disappointed all of the movie funny scenes were included in the ad so what do we get eve marks meg ryan just put her father lou mozell walter matthau into hospital once upon time lou was hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now estranged wife his one great moment in life was writing film for john wayne who gave him giant bullet shaped trophy now lou is senile and deteriorating rapidly eve tries to convince her sisters georgia diane keaton and maddy lisa kudrow that their father is dying and needs them both are slow to show concern so devoted eve stands vigil over her father who constantly asks for his favorite daughter georgia while running her own business planning special events and caring for her son jesse james some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st bernard for eve to care for the tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eve events where georgia is the keynote speaker there superficial resemblance to shakespeare king lear senile king with three daughters one devoted saint and two selfish bitches but the material is apparently drawn from life sister screenwriters delia and nora ephron had parents who were successful hollywood writing team henry and phoebe ephron collaborated on 17 screenplays including desk set and there no business like show business delia novel the basis for the film is dedicated to henry surprisingly the script is as thin as an anorexic wet dream the virtue of semi autobiographical project would seem to be the wealth of material available yet the ephrons provide only the barest minimum of information about their characters also the spaces they inhabit seem artificial eve lives in house that looks like magazine layout no matter how put upon she is we can feel sorry for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day georgia is famous magazine editor and in her brief scenes while she chats on cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for profile when we first meet maddy she fishing at picturesque mountain stream expected to see the credit cinematography by vanity fair and yes diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrow mother to her credit though she looks young enough to pull it off the one redeeming aspect of hanging up is that at its core is truth about siblings there always one on which everyone else in the family relies freeing the others to be selfish and emotionally distant my wife is the reliable child in her family for better or worse my brother has the role in mine being selfish and emotionally distant may not be fulfilling but it is lot less work if you have nothing better to do than watch this movie look for powerful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters mother pat in devastating scene eve discovers that her mother doesn love her although leachman is best known for comedies like young frankenstein and the mary tyler moore show her performance here reminded me of the considerable dramatic talent she displayed in the last picture show bottom line everyone involved has lived in hollywood so long they don recognize real life anymore
this is the worst movie ve seen since the so bad walked out on it jingle all the way it is crap on toast made of crap baked in an oven fueled by crap it is crap through and through nothing works in this film as to be expected from joel schumacher who has made only one watchable film in his entire career that being cousins here man who admits he medicore director rather charmingly self effacing statement but truth be told he is much worse than mediocre not all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again there is no plot anywhere and the dialogue is unrelentingly shallow preposterous and boring they set up mr freeze as tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one liners it turns him into stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death but that par for course nothing in this film makes any sense including half of arnold schwarzenegger lines as mr freeze arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once this is the same problem he had in jingle all the way and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass personally think that he has more pull with the directors and doesn retake scenes to make him understandable compare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in batman robin apparently james cameron knows how to get competent performance out of arnold uma thurman is not as bad but nothing resembling good either her poison ivy vamps around terribly chewing up scenery left and right and her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub snl standard acting as if she reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment given the script it wonder it didn happen more frequently there is no redeeming feature in this film not george clooney as batman chris donnell as robin nor alicia silverstone as batgirl michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance in fact there was something unsettling about his appearance which seems to have been accomplished without any make up tricks looking as if it were scenes from documentary about dying man unfortunately every scene about alfred sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance they just go through the motions losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart the movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of big battle you know there bunch of people but instead of melee schumacher decided to focus on foot or fist there never moment of awe wonder or mayhem the only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects which are impressive and probably expensive even then the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable the hockey team from hell not even the tv series got that stupid at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that batman robin showcases frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do blink and you ll miss elle macpherson as julie madison vivica fox as why is she even in the film vamp in freeze lair with all of two lines and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had and in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs fries she isn even filmed well enough to look good trust me she quite attractive outside of this dreck and as if the film weren bad enough to limp along with bad direction bad dialogue bad performances and bad fight scenes there are inconsistencies and illogic galore know it nit picky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs why the character arms aren ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish one armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet while holding on to another person no less or where the moisture comes from when freeze weapon creates tons if ice that all traditional comic book stuff but why does batman spring trap for freeze at public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of by standers why is there big switch clearly marked heat in mr freeze lair why do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr freeze hand to hand why does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have suit made for her why do batman robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency and since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones why don they wear masks to filter it out could go on and on batman robin is braindead pointless garish loud film that should still reign as the worst film of the year by the time 1998 rolls along note to warner bros if you re going to make another batman film please replace schumacher with nearly anyone because it could actually get worse than this what schumacher does not understand is that comic book doesn automatically equal unbearable idiocy the true equation seems to be schumacher batman unbearable idiocy
when ponder childhood memories past one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the inspector gadget tv show with my older brother truth be told we were rabid fanatics our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr claw the inspector arch nemesis was never biggie on nostalgia but you just can help but have fond memories of something like that sometimes even find myself up at 4am watching re runs of my favorite episodes trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder felt as kid at the very least was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me despite how horrid film may be the simple task of rekindling even slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up so back sat with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver let face it exactly how good can live action disney film really be was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr magoo and george of the jungle two previous disney adaptations and wish to god that had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well rarely has movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind was left sitting there absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what had just seen can something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world right from the beginning knew was in trouble in the opening scenes each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be to simply serve as real life duplicates of their cartoon clones when referring to them people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who certain character is supposed to be oh hi penny is brain with you creating one dimensional replicas is one thing having mere names take the place of them is quite another the plot shall we call it stays fairly in tune with the original series matthew broderick stars as john brown how creative is that security guard who is horribly injured by pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex why rupert everett for the love of god why who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events brown is then rescued and used as prototype for new law enforcement technology wherein he joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form drumroll please inspector gadget >from here on out the movie becomes hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations although to be fair my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind there something about an evil gadget taking over the city his first crime must have been swiping matt dillon dentures from there something about mary and it all ends with what else bunch of post credit nonsense and cameo by don adams himself to be honest wasn much paying attention to these treats was just glad that it was over
perhaps if the impostors didn have so much going for it it wouldn have been such tremendous disappointment written directed and produced by one of its two stars stanley tucci whose last picture was the indie smash hit big night the impostors almost never catches fire sputtering like two day old campfire the story plays like an ad lib sketch that was never polished or completed the film other star oliver platt was hilarious as the senator aide in bulworth the bloated supporting cast is veritable cornucopia of acting talent including woody allen steve buscemi hope davis alfred molina campbell scott lili taylor and tony shalhoub all are wasted save allen who plays theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes the audience will easily identify with allen sentiments with the exception of single original joke involving mirror imaged subtitles the movie engenders little genuine laughter the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it the plot for the movie involves two starving actors maurice oliver platt and arthur stanley tucci who accidentally end up on cruise ship in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor alfred molina who is chasing them they dress up as ship stewards the over the top script has the subtlety of sledgehammer when the leads hide from their pursuers arthur covers maurice mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze at other times we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else while darting in and out of staterooms with the film chapters introduced like placards at vaudeville stage it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what good time all of the actors were having too bad they weren more concerned with the audience potential enjoyment the jokes frequently framed in silence fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film dailies surely if they had they would have realized what leaden results they were producing it is tricky having good actors play bad ones but if they couldn pull it off they should have just given up the show is over for this fella steve buscemi character says towards the end the mystery is why they didn all give up in the beginning there must have been better script somewhere for such wonderful cast the impostors runs 42 it is rated for little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up
this was the last carry on movie if you discount carry on columbus as carry on movie and was made by new production company based in central london this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert suzanne danielle to bed her husband emile the french ambassador kenneth williams when he seems unwilling she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes such as the prime minister and the ambassador her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead meanwhile theodore valentine larry dann is in love with emmannuelle after chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her however she is only interested in restoring her husband ardour which seems little difficult after emile accident with church spire this film is the second worst carry on movie the worst being carry on england it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid as mrs valentine are mildly funny but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad kenneth williams only appears in few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted given the script the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler joan sims as mrs dangle kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur and peter butterworth as richmond are worthless and embarassing in fact all four parts are surplus to requirements however the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades an awful script terrible collection of jokes very poor production values especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st james palace ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score and non existent plot or storyline its just succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile complete waste of time this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies it was certificate 15 film but by 1978 there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998 avoid at all costs
if you re debating whether or not to see _breakfast_of_champions_ ask yourself one simple question do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie the only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross section of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight everyone else and hoping that most people would be wise to steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess actually though the sight of nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle which focuses dwayne hoover bruce willis the owner of dwayne hoover exit 11 motor village in midland city not only is he huge success as businessman he also something of celebrity his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials with nice home and family to boot dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy yet he not his wife celia barbara hershey is perpetually in pill induced haze his son george lukas haas is flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name bunny not only that the environmental protection agency is on dwayne ass over building development project it enough to send dwayne on nervous breakdown that is if he doesn succeed in blowing his brains out first meanwhile midland city is about to host fine arts festival and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout albert finney writer who is far from the renowned author the festival organizer buck henry was led to believe in fact he penniless hack who writes second rate sci fi that appears in porn magazines his trek to midland city is also spiritual journey one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne who for some reason thinks that trout will hold for him all of life answers the above is already longer plot synopsis than usually give in my reviews but ironically have barely scratched the surface haven yet mentioned wayne hoobler omar epps an ex con with an obsessive admiration for the similarly named dwayne then there the matter of francine glenne headly dwayne devoted secretary not to mention dwayne employee and old friend harry lesabre nolte the one with the secret penchant for cross dressing and so on the film is essentially dwayne story but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point is rudolph does arrive at point more on that later but it blunted and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material the surreal visual style complete with printed words flying through the air and into dwayne ears is obviously meant to convey sense of madness but its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad the actors are called on to act accordingly resulting in some of the worst most overdone work all of them have ever turned in willis fares best of all but that because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience with such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running time it comes as shock when things suddenly turn serious and rudolph tries to make statement unlike _american_beauty_ film that _breakfast_ resembles in more than few ways to its great detriment there isn any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the audience for the big shift as such the cartoony characters fail to win sympathy that needs to be earned and the film attempts to no avail to reach profundity that it doesn deserve vonnegut original novel is considered classic but it had been called unfilmable the same that was said of hunter thompson _fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas_ which was disastrously committed to film last year by terry gilliam with the similar failure of _breakfast_of_champions_ will hollywood ever learn that books labeled unfilmable inevitably results in film that is unwatchable likely not
suicide is pointless everyone should know that so what this movie like you guessed it pointless the virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide it sets in motion series of events that will change the lives of many people forever that what the press materials for the film probably say now here what say the virgin suicides is huge waste of time boring arty pretentious junk that is about as entertaining as well as committing suicide the movie lost me early on immediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window the girl father james woods holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on then as the scene ends the lawn sprinklers come on is that joke is that supposed to be amusing in some way from then on the movie failed to draw me back in performances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides woods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well dunst has the potential to be big star if she chooses her projects well and while this film is awful she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed there are also few cameos in the film here and there which only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more as result they all seem rather pointless although there brief role given to michael pare from eddie and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since well since eddie and the cruisers perhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the main characters we never get any significant insight into the girls and why they might be feeling what they re feeling all we really know is that mrs lisbon kathleen turner is strict and keeps them on short leash what mother doesn it certainly no reason to commit suicide with the godfather part iii sofia coppola proved that she had no business being in front of the camera with the virgin suicides she proves she has no business behind it either having family connections doesn entitle you to be allowed to make movies so attention film directors stop letting your daughters pout their way into the industry just because they share your dna doesn mean they share your talent [r]
the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities the best tales of the genre deal with mankind struggle for survival or knowledge such popular and noteworthy tomes as stranger in strange land by robert heinlein childhood end by arthur clarke and man in the high castle and do androids dream of electric sheep by philip dick all deal with man need for identity and struggle for self worth hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu if not the message of science fiction since it beginnings most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved it really wasn until producer george pal took charge of robert heinlein novel rocketship galileo and crafted the film destination moon that sci fi as it is commonly referred to came into it own from there such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre with the release of touchstone pictures mission to mars we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe the film opens on summer barbecue as phil ohlmyer jerry connell woos young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission woody blake tim robbins and his wife terri connie nielsen commit to his coming authority on the mission and luc goddard don cheadle consoles his son entering the party is jim mcconnell gary sinise who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife maggie kim delaney luc consoles jim with woody assistance the three men are friends and carry fine bond of trust and caring between them but jim still longs to set foot on the kirmizi planet the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface going out to investigate luc and his team approach the famed face on mars strange noise emanates from the rock as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar violent wind storm erupts creating vortex that kills all members of the team save for luc back on the space station orbiting earth woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing luc interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt second mission to the kirmizi planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger meteorite showers explosions and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet surface the big question is is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars and if so what is its relationship with us now for the bad news the entire plot of mission to mars is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe the famed face on mars becomes the centerpiece of the film revealing some of the most harebrained sci fi pabulum the screen has witnessed borrowing ideas from such films as robinson crusoe on mars 1964 quatermass and the pit 1967 2001 space odyssey and even mario bava planet of the vampires terrore nello spazio 1965 mission to mars is hodgepodge of ideas that don add up to satisfying whole while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed the film remains flat and un involving so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film but to no good use the performances are all workmen like with only don cheadle as luc carrying any sort of real chemistry gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation and the mistaken idea of having jerry connell as phil ohlmyer play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better he just having too much fun here to give damn the script has few lapses namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by meteorite shower no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship also when one character sacrifices himself the character takes on religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid intrusive score by ennio morricone subtlety is non existent here in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out the only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower the pacing of the film is very leisurely after the opening introduction of the characters which lasts full 22 minutes we are finally dropped onto the martian surface then there is another long pause in the plot for more character development including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity the film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum there are so many scenes of talking heads discussing what we already know is going to happen that it drags the film to dead stop the good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at the vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring the design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted with level of realism that hasn been seen since 2001 space odyssey the visual effects are just stunning from the space walk sequences to the visualization of evolution on earth the only fault come with the martians themselves which look more like something out of plastic model kit than something from another world director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film the opening sequence alone in seemingly un interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes an homage to hitchcock rope as we are introduced to all of the characters scenes in the rescue ship with its rotating centrifuge are just amazing in their execution but the nagging question is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang sadly it is not director brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production the set design and visual effects are all arresting but it the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been fine return to good adventurous thought provoking science fiction disappointing film but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals
back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention new line cinema put on lavish presentation for its big screen update of the cult 1960s sci fi tv show lost in space complete with in person appearances by cast members mimi rogers matt leblanc lacey chabert jack johnson and even gary oldman that should have set off my warning alarms the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in person cameo to peddle last action hero but no like millions of others bought into the hype and got lost if only had gotten lost literally on the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped together blockbuster wannabe you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film at the convention goldsman claimed to be rabid fan of the original television series and if that really is the case hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is narrative to begin with which there most certainly is not after the setup in which the robinson family father john william hurt looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews mother maureen rogers wasted daughters judy heather graham ditto and penny heavily made up chabert looking like junior version of neve campbell in wild things and son will young newcomer johnson making the best of it and pilot don west leblanc doing bad han solo impression find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr smith watered down but still lively oldman cashing paycheck and loving every minute the script stream of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along and hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting they encounter another ship they board it alien spiders attack them they return to their ship the other one explodes they land on deserted planet and so on an attempt at plot involving time travel occurs in the third act but goldsman doesn seem to understand the rules that come with using such story device when one character past self dies the future incarnation inexplicably lives on the look and effects should be lost in space ace in the hole but hopkins even manages to botch that for big budget film the visual effects are incredibly shoddy in one composite background shot could see the mavi outline around oldman the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like digital effects but nothing in those shots is as jaw droppingly unconvincing as blawp monkey like space creature that becomes penny pet entirely computer generated and every inch showing it blawp looks like it was lifted directly from sony playstation game apparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it how else can one explain the graininess of blawp composite shots with the human actors but in doing so the seams are that much more obvious you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by crystal clear solo reaction shot of judy new line is hoping lost in space will become big franchise much like the long running star trek cash cow at paramount don think so in few years the lost in space movie will likely live on not as series but as the obscure answer to trivia question what film ended titanic 15 week reign at the top of the weekend box office
the working title for no looking back was long time nothing new and rarely has there been more apt name for motion picture even though this movie clocks in at relatively skinny 96 minutes it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics writer director edward burns has trotted out hackneyed storyline the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn spent their life in seclusion instead of tweaking the formula little to invigorate the proceedings burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful the most appropriate ending would have been triple suicide and the sooner the better alas that not the case and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio and to further depress audiences burns has shot the entire film on cold rainy days in gray new york state beach town peeks of sunshine are few and far between no wonder the characters are all so miserable first of all we have charlie burns generation slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home that girlfriend is claudia lauren holly and after picking up the pieces of her life following charlie departure she has moved on shacking up with one of charlie old school buddies mike jon bon jovi the two have comfortable relationship but it apparent to even blind person that they re not right for each other claudia years for some spice in her life mike wants to settle down and have children then charlie re enters the mix so who if anyone will claudia end up with who cares no looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that we re not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle so what if no one finds happiness these characters don deserve it anyway especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time they aren real people they re writer construct stumbling through too obvious storyline they should know the ending as well as we do and burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with plot that at least offered surprise or two another frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with group of potentially interesting supporting characters blythe danner is solid as claudia housebound mother connie britton is suitably high strung as claudia neurotic sister and jennifer esposito is eye catching as bartender in search of little romance sadly all we get is quick glimpses into their lives although movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell none of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes edward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here jon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from singer branching into different career but he could still use little polish the worst case is lauren holly who presents completely bland claudia as portrayed here she hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even moment interest not to mention undying love burns ex the monumentally untalented maxine bahns would have been hard pressed to do less inspired job when he released the brothers mcmullen edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the 1995 sundance film festival robert redford has apparently stuck with him the aging actor director executive produced this mess two films and three short years later the luster has faded some movie makers have only one good film in them with back to back duds like she the one and no looking back to follow the delightful brothers burns is beginning to look like member of that undistinguished club
the job of the film critic is to see movie and write review of it that tells you what it about and why it good or bad feel kind of embarrassed to admit this but after having seen get carter really can tell you what it about although could go on and on about how and why it bad movie get carter falls into that category of movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of hollywood executive board room you might call them the steven seagal mickey rourke jean claude van damme wesley snipes school of mediocre action crime thrillers you know the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights shoot outs and car chases but really light on plot and character development they have stories where the so called hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight chase or shoot at sylvester stallone stars as jack carter las vegas based mob enforcer who returns home for his brother funeral he believes his brother richie was taken out and didn die from dwi accident carter one of the most cliche bad asses ever captured on celluloid his face alone is pretty intimidating and there quite few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his rambo on testosterone therapy voice stallone performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesn realize he mocking himself the actual story involves carter investigation into his brother richie death he in town that not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well mickey rourke co stars as one of these characters sort of crime boss who has something to do with running porno web site and blackmailing young internet tycoon played by alan cummings looking and acting lot like pee wee herman there also another plot involving richie mistress secret cd rom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carter still living relatives rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in way that could be remotely comprehendible could just rip the screenplay to shreds plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all don like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally yes get carter is just that complicated and complex and what worse is that it not this intricate to make it seem smart like the usual suspects for example just the opposite you get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably didn remember what had already happened and didn figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax all you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another asking them what they know getting information and then realizing that if he wasn complete idiot he could have figured it out in the first five minutes although the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another making movie entirely about criminals doesn necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters mel gibson starred in payback few years ago that had story not unlike this one but had such good screenplay you couldn help but like him even though he was just as bad guy as jack carter so ultimately get carter fails for pretty much every selling point it has carter is not likable character and you really don care if he gets revenge or not the action sequences are not at all exciting or original the enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all mon you know who going to win every brawl and shoot out and car chase in the end you don feel nearly satisfied with the results the filmmakers did good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible the city is never mentioned by name but assume it seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and it always raining
ve got to admit it huge jim carrey fan loved the first ace ventura as well as the mask and dumb and dumber and even in batman forever which was pretty awful movie carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good until saw ace ventura had no idea how people could find the guy annoying sadly ace ventura shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie but this time it is no longer funny it is just rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save raccoon in reasonable cliffhanger spoof soon he is called out of retirement to find bat which was kidnapped and if not returned in four days will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other once again it up to ace to save the day using his uncanny detective skills those who have been disappointed by carrey more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him over acting to the best of his ability but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesn capture the feel of the original the original benefited from what looked to be carrey constant hyped up improv sequences which were hysterically funny here however the tighter script which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies takes the improvised material from the first and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie giving carrey little chance to improvise instead his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly but one of the biggest problems had was with the character of ventura himself in the first movie he was always cool and one step ahead of every one else perfect for carrey off the wall approach but here ventura is made to look lot stupider and is often made out as the straight guy role which is definitely not carrey style there are definitely some very funny moments but they are few and far between they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura or even dumb and dumber
for about twenty minutes into mission impossible director john woo the killer hard boiled face off appears to have made an exciting elegant charming spy thriller kind of post millennium james bond adventure with strapping american read unsophisticated hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them sadly as the picture progresses the final product begins to bear closer resemblance to souped up two hour long episode of magyuver and not particularly good one at that what went wrong mi2 begins flashily enough that initial flash leading us to believe that it ll soon give way to something of plot but it only gives way to more flash then digresses further into presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise firing gun just so they can die really cool early on during car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt tom cruise and nyah nordoff hall thandie newton woo works some of his trademark magic in one hypnotic though completely inexplicable sequence the director slows the action down to languid semi stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other eyes with come hither sexuality just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance coming ever so close to toppling over neighboring cliff prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing steep mountain sans scaffolding then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another why haven the foggiest doubt even john woo could provide you with logical reply with mi2 woo has become slave to the summer movie machine the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects it possible that these spies could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off though of course this is never explored the scenes ve described are really only included to titillate not to give any insight into character god forbid woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial like visuals still in terms of crackerjack eye candy the opening has much to cherish cruise and newton first meet during vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is between the frantic dancing woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact the scene is little over the top in bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way yet it has style and something of soul and woo casts bit of spell on us sure it all smoke and mirrors but we can see that there happens to be talented maestro behind this particular product thandie and cruise later meet in bathtub in scene that about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres newton bats her eyes flirtatiously cruise grins little too slyly the cruise character ethan hunt has been drastically altered since the first film here cruise plays him more as hip sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part he cool and dashing which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut which might just be the longest episode of kirmizi show diaries ever committed to film and blustered his way through magnolia quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90 sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise initial the man charm and more slo mo close ups of his preening mug mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won stop the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle the first gun fight in the film which really should be unheard of in john woo film but alas this particular battle could ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi of course excepting the symbolic pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture we ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing gun in each hand it isn done any differently here the action is pure hard target broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind he cool for sure but he made to be as empty as the movie the actor isn used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment be it during gunfight before one or after one when he not beaming away he staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell but woo editing seriously undermines the effort he fetishizes cruise angular face with such glee that it turns into naked gun style spoof half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he really austin powers in classic woo action moment ethan hunt struts past fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like pin up boy angel of death the gunfight turns into daring escape which turns into reckless mission which turns into motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does the lead bad guy played by the appropriately british dougray scott and cruise face off in mentally deficient game of chicken on motorcycles though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other mid air bear hug only to fly about hundred feet still in bear hug position land on beach below and begin mano mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling so you thought was dead not to worry cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking sweat what hero you may have noticed that opted not to describe an iota of mi2 plot my reasoning is simple not sure of any good it would do the film itself has absolutely no concern with story only with hurtling forth to the next special effect wasn kidding when told friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video nobody will go to this for the plot and if they do they ll surely regret it as summer movies evolve or devolve character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing in mi the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma that film director stylistic flourishes while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo non stop masturbatory pandemonium it irrelevant in every sense as is character all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors
every now and then reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact either good or bad that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings but sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review the impression left by the film wasn overwhelming on the contrary there were hardly any impression at all since had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it which surprise me to this day because the movie theatre was full was close to sound speakers the show wasn late and didn lack sleep before the show such things happen very rarely to me and after many years the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters old peter brackett nick nolte and young aspiring sabrina peterson julia roberts two of them are assigned to cover the train collision as soon as they meet they start scooping each other but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk and also the romantic feelings they have for each other the plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison tre romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn movie author director and screenwriter charles shyer who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride tries again this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts however although there is some chemistry between the two soon it stops to arouse any interest it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix that collides light hearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers shyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two and fails in both areas making the story cliched and predictable the end result is rather forgettable effort which convinced me not to watch movie again ll give it the benefit of the doubt though
the only two really good things that can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows jane march was very cute as jane and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length if you haven already figured it out didn like this movie very much the plot was boring and contrived to the extreme tarzan casper van dien has now left the jungle and living in civilized society he is just days away from his impending marriage to jane played by the aptly named jane march back in his former home of africa group of looters has found the key to locating lost city mind you never really figured out why they actually wanted to find this city anyway tarzan old jungle friend appears to him in vision tarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city he leaves jane his first mistake in my opinion and travels to africa of course jane is hot on her ape man heals the two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys sound like dumb explanation of the plot it actually an improvement over the real thing the acting is just plain awful not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film but it wasn acting jane march wasn heck of lot better but at least she is easy on the eyes compounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re recorded and ve seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies added to the sound problems was the cinematography this film was filled with beautiful african scenery but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me quite frankly think you could probably do better job capturing the beauty of africa with camcorder than this bunch did with professional film equipment then we have the special effects special effects in tarzan movie you are no doubt asking yourself yes friends the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements into the story probably for the sake of using cgi since it did nothing but hurt the story in most parts they weren bad just nothing special but they were more than little on the hokey side except of course when we got to the ridiculous climax of this movie the grand finale special effects went right into the toilet at that point it almost looked like they had run out of money these effects were of noticeably lower quality than those in the rest of the film and looked like something in an amateur video production took one lesson away from watching tarzan and the lost city ape men and bones that morph into skeletal warriors don mix stay far away from this version of tarzan
silly performances and some huge gaps in logic mar an otherwise interesting tale of an eclectic group of people stranded at the last stop cafe and motel due to heavy snowfall one of the stranded is colorado state highway patrolman adam beach who discovers murder scene and bag full of cash from recent bank robbery someone amongst the group of strangers is bank robber and murderer but is it the same person or are there multiple criminals adam beach unfortunately was the wrong choice for the lead in this film he doesn play the role with enough seriousness to be believable or enough goofiness for it to be funny his performance is stuck somewhere in the middle and this film really needed it to be on one side or the other rose mcgowan is cold and unpleasant to the eye as always and jurgen prochnow what on earth is he doing in this best performance comes from william taylor as cheesy yet still somehow cool and confident wayne newton drifter type the last stop is available on dvd from sterling home entertainment as usual with sterling they ve filled out this dvd with extra features the disc contains the film in its original aspect ratio of 85 choice of dolby surround sound or dolby digital surround sound full length audio commentary track with director mark malone interviews with the cast and crew the original trailer and the usual cast and crew biographies the film itself might not be the greatest but sterling effort of adding decent extra features while keeping the price affordable suggested retail of $19 95 makes this dvd worth the money [r]
by phil curtolo madonna antonio banderas jonathan price in an alan parker film with music from andrew lloyd weber and lyrics by tim rice evita now have to admit the trailer for this rock opera turned major motion picture is almost breath taking for some the soundtrack is wonderful to listen to so why wouldn the movie be wonderful to see simple little over hours of constant singing can almost drive you insane the story of eva duarte madonna evita is full of drama that trapped inside by all the notes and chords she was an orphaned child who ends up becoming hooker then goes into the field of acting and finally meets juan peron price the soon to be first president of argentina they fall in love and eventually marry sounds pretty good doesn it well the story gets better as eva goes on the rainbow tour across europe trying to win respect eva duarte was wonderful lady however all of the drama packed moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood went into theater at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring and left with happy because was right they only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar although it did come off as dull the beautiful cinematography is eye catching as was madonna performance as the spiritual leader of argentina madonna would have definitely been an oscar contender had she spoken single line but her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical film don get me wrong and don look at my grade am not big fan of musicals on the big screen if you re going to pay to see movie you want to see movie now have to admit it lot cheaper to pay $5 than $200 plus to see the play but that what did me in all this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before even saw the movie now you may be saying what kind of critic is he and you re right as critic should have given the movie chance but as 17 year old quentin tarantino fan it was way too hard
have never seen man so in love with himself than george lucas with the overt success of the three original star wars films lucas has become not necessarily filmmaker but the head cheeze at huge toy company with the phantom menace the new product on the shelve only this toy was made for $115 million but every kid wants it and like all other expensive toys falls apart within an hour after playing with it the product in question star wars episode the phantom menace jeez is pure and simple its about the money baby no one in their right mind would create such fiasco if they knew it wouldn make ton of money before its fourth week of release come to the sw franchise as stranger since have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular find them rather boring and full of nothing but eye candy phantom menace is like the first sw minus 10 nothing in the whole concept is remotely enjoyable even the special effects seem rather bland the story in this new one is mindless mess the acting wooden and the action sequences like something out of video game sw phantom menace is one of the worst films of the year so far with title like sw e1 tpm lucas has one big head on those shoulders thought chris carter did for releasing an files movie although that movie adaptation was an excellent way to spend two hours pm is one long headache
an affluent horse breeder past comes up to haunt him an ages old cover up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices that pretty much the essence of the movie and have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source the acting in particular found very good the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie few things about the story didn sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone yet in the end her character played relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better on the flip side the character played by catherine keener found to be very interesting and thought that it was developed very well and helped the story lot the character aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener all these people acted their parts admirably as for the part that sharon stone played she played it well but the part was not utilized enough the directing for this movie is something that have to comment on because for once in long while you see director actually add very distinctive flavor to movie this is one of those occasions matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and think he tackled touch subject myself wouldn be able to look at horseracing and make movie out of it there is certain flavor about this movie and think that the direction of the movie is the reason for this the one flaw that do have to comment on is the pacing the subject matter in my opinion wasn interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if myself don like it all in all found this movie boring and very slow the acting was good but the story just didn evolve enough and wasn captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch although there is much going for the movie didn find it good even though see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them wouldn recommend this movie to anyone but if you are horse fanatic or racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie
fullyloaded entertainment review website coming soon hunter thompson fear and loathing in las vegas written in 1971 is already an american classic not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post psychedelia of the 1960 but also because it ushered in new form of journalism known as gonzo soon after the book was written hunter thomspon became the basis for character in doonesbury known as uncle duke and that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas the movie although the book is one of my favorites now agree with thompson own assessment of the novel as unfilmable the main problem is that the book although detailing wild drug use and tripped out adventures was not written on the road it was written and edited by hunter thomspons relatively sober at his home so although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use it is told with sense of aloofness and some humor hunter thomspon the narrator while always drugged out still has grip on reality and can still tell with journalistic ability what is going on around him not so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas despite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped the movie is an exact duplicate of the book in terms of dialouge unfortunately this can get annoying in the form of johnny depp who plays thompson excessive narration and the characters while having vivid personalities are played as characers on the screen dr raoul duke johnny depp the name raoul duke was an alias of thompson and his riding companion dr gonzo benicio del toro who is large samoan lawyer have no personalities or emotions at all save for stoned the film is very faithful to the plot what there is of the book in that dr raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400 and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs from there one set of stoned adventures after another happens including one of the few good scenes in which depp high on acid watches all the people in the bar around him turn into literally lounge lizards while the movie has its moments few it is almost unwatchable at parts especially towards the end despite lot of celebrity cameos the stars never get off the ground the set decoration and costumes are great and probably deserve an oscar nomination however as we all know it not sets or effects that make movie its the characters and quite frankly these characters are no good
filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up dull dreary and overused idea doug liman swingers director of the ultra hip and severely dark comedy go is an example of just such filmmaker in his latest he gives the viewers raucous neon lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down drug infested path of misadventure as director but he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi tiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same his movie is produced anthology style telling the same story from multiple three points of view much as an author might write serial novel consistent with this ethic liman and screenwriter john august provide bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives the thread that laces the three stories together is drug deal and the events thereafter in story we have checkout clerk ronna sarah polley looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it in story we have regular drug dealer simon desmond askew gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity and in story we have gay soap actors zack jay mohr and adam scott wolf working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal neither of the three stories have much substance and the movie has the feel of campfire story albeit rather strange one that could be told in five to ten minutes in fact the movie was originally short film entitled expanded to feature length the early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie christmas setting and the los angeles las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater goers to attach themselves to the characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite and performances from little known players like polley askew and taye diggs don help or hurt the roles in fact even bigger names like mohr wolf and katie holmes don have enough time to make substantial success although that almost expected for lack of continuous screen time the success in the picture should come from thread that binds the stories go doesn have this and it suffers because of it as far as teen movies are concerned go represents the absolute bottom for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme the following do not count as common themes drug deals people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them at times the humor in go is sickly funny and on low night almost watchable but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on saturday night
to watch `battlefield earth is to wallow in misery it is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history it has clumsily told story insipid dialogue shallow characterizations ugly scene transitions no evidence of dramatic arc headache inducing sound effects and resolution that is completely implausible worse there the promise of sequel why save your money some films go quickly to video this one however should go straight to the sci fi channel `mystery science theatre in the year 3000 man has become an endangered species most of humanity called man animals was destroyed generations ago in battle against race of plundering aliens called psychlos survivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved to mine earth resources for the rest of their lives the aliens are menacing looking humanoid species that stand nine feet tall who resemble inbred klingons dimwitted as they are tall their culture is predicated on power extortion and getting leverage travolta the leverage using star plays terl the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth much of the movie is spent showing us examples of terl petty machinations he routinely employs deception and then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter but one thing is certain he hates being stationed on earth when the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet he begins to devise his latest plan he will select group of slaves to secretly mine out altin ore site it not clear how this benefits terl except that it makes him richer in place where he has no use for it the scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler barry peppers is selected as the slave group leader psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining know how but the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language the principles of our founding fathers euclidean geometry and the location of fort knox this enlightenment just doesn prepare him for the mining assignment it also prepares him to organize and stage massive revolt against their captors `we re going to blow up their home world he says `but first we need few more supplies in days he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling loincloth wearing rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts by now the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl the media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travolta labor of love is piece of sci fi drivel numerous journals have called it an ill conceived idea stemming from blind hubris arrogance and poor planning and after watching this movie you ll wholeheartedly agree this is terrible film that is illogically constructed tediously acted and frequently begs the question why was this ever made at price tag of $90 million this film will be remembered as gigantic folly assuredly becoming `the avengers of this summer both films were unforgivable and this promises to suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity in addition to the universally pejorative reviews there another bizarre element to the `battlefield saga this film would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta who for over decade had been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to the big screen the controversy is that travolta is scientologist and `battlefield is based on 1982 novel by ron hubbard the religion late founder this led some to believe that `battlefield earth would amount to scientologist dogma laden with subliminal messages but the story is so poorly told that any message subliminal or otherwise is totally undetectable if the audience got anything out of this film it was this we are not too unlike the psychlo leader like terl the audience felt imprisoned dreaded their situation and looked for any opportunity to leave could that be the scientology message
you can have any of this it all mine twisted priest charles huevelman hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana angela zimmerly looks on uninterested an evil presence appropriately named the presence dj vivona rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him for kicks the presence likes to trick human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered when something goes wrong and one of the presence recent victims escapes the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is threat that needs to be stopped they enlist the help of alison ramona midgett recent suicide victim to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether realm her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed the king sorcerer amblyn who also lost his job decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice during the downtime in his unemployment amblyn decided to create new dimension where sorcery evil and torture ruled abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love in this new realm amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm after each murder abraham would become stronger until his power surpassed that of amblyn because of the screw up that allowed the recent escape abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself as alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered if there one thing can stand when see film it when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this and now ice from the sun can be added to this list this film is essentially an 80 minute stalk and slash film following the dante inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street through intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and supposedly haunting images many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot if there aren bizarre images floating past the screen then we get pointless shots of suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone compelling but ultimately not the opening credits sequence is designed like music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images the credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesn pop up until near the end of the sequence when the opening credits began thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv at least the music in the film is pretty decent made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features song by ramona midgett at the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them and he talks like darth vader clone without the heavy breathing for some reason though he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance one over alled cretin handles the presence gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel then there an inbred father dwight spurgin and his two inbred children mark kettler and jennifer poirrier wallace that take care of young woman who has been transformed into half dog half human mix with shotgun and of course big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds why would you want to give responsibilities to bunch of rednecks when you yourself had all of these cool powers and how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging salting sequence the character in question dana angela zimmely has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of movie theater in which the presence is seated priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to large platter of fried chicken he picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever when she starts to leave the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like either creature from gwar show or terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life walks out and makes like it wants to be crucified by her the presence starts to clap annoyingly which continues for the rest of the sequence until dana takes off with the strange creature following her when it finally catches up to her she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ the box for the film claims because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 contains nudity and graphic violence while both is certainly true there doesn seem to be much of either in any large amounts besides loving close up of spurting neck stump semi graphic self surgery scene and two instances of head trauma one run over and one melting most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety as for nudity it is very sparse but at least we get to see angela zimmerly far and away the most attractive cast member before her body is bruised torn and bloodied by the dragging incident ice from the sun has been released on vhs by www movie com it has been presented in in full frame only and the transfer for film shot good deal in 8mm is pretty decent besides the decent soundtrack which is also available from www movie com making of video is also available called on thin ice haven had the opportunity to see the documentary but actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed if only to see how director eric stanze director of similar cult film called savage harvest conducted the atmosphere on set

it rare treat when quality horror film is released in the theater and unfortunately with man best friend we ll be waiting while longer the film stars ally sheedy and lance henrikson in tale of bio genetics gone wrong sheedy plays nosy reporter whose need for good story provokes her to snoop inside of emax poorly guarded million dollar bio lab that she finds herself effortlessly intruding the result she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named max german shepherd with genetic recombination allowing it to swallow like snake camouflage like chameleon climb trees like leopard and attack with the strength of tiger max takes liking to sheedy and she finds herself protecting the animal from the cruel technological realm of emax owned by henrikson well it doesn take long before the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon the unsuspecting suburban landscape which offers max juicy leg of mailman etc sheedy is boring non presence on the screen tripping through the enormous plot chasms neglected by the writer director apologize for lack of credits suppose was eager to leave the theater and in my rush forgot to take note of the director writer producer etc henrikson offered the only relief from the contrived narration of the script giving his character as much development as he could considering the flat dialogue plaguing the film the movie depends upon it ability to impress the audience with animal special effects but all it presents is dog that can growl open door handles with his paw sit roll over play dead and sick the rest of the special effects were so poor found them offensive the film attains sub mediocrity an unambitious film at best horror fans might find that cujo offers better bite
joe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made in very recent memory the strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it it has solid cast with tom hanks meg ryan as the lead roles but you can never judge movie by its cast if there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano it is that the plot is original unfortunately it is also incredibly stupid the movie begins with joe tom hanks going to work this opening sequence is very boring and slow it shows joe walking to his office but on the way he has to wait in long line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting sequence like this should take minutes here it takes over it is obvious that joe hates his job at his office one of his co workers is meg ryan oddly enough she plays different roles in this movie joe leaves to go to doctor appointment his doctor informs him that he has brain cloud this means that in few months he will die so what does joe do quit his job of course when he arrives home joe meets an old man named graynamore lloyd bridges graynamore tells joe that in order to get some important mineral for his company from an island the natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcano to please their fire god by startling coincidence the boat trip to the island takes few months by the time he reaches the island he will almost be dead from the brain cloud anyway so joe agrees graynamore gives joe credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this great adventure joe goes on date with meg ryan his co worker the day before the boat trip joe meets one of graynamore daughters she is also surprise meg ryan except she looks more hippyish they both have dinner and the next day joe gets driven over to his boat the lady that sails the boat is another one of graynamore daughters and wonder of wonders she is also played by meg ryan as they sail to the island meg ryan tells joe that the natives of the island have craving for orange soda after some stupid talking scenes they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went to and that the brain cloud thing was made up they do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage joe goes fishing and catches hammerhead shark this is cheap gag that has been pulled off many times but to top it off the shark is obviously rubber and fake one night there is storm cheap looking lightning bolt strikes the boat and everything is cast overboard fortunately joe and meg ryan manage to find some of the luggage that joe brought to sail by pure luck they get to the island since the natives like orange soda they wear soda cans as attire stupid or what before joe leaps in the volcano he gets fed right before he jumps meg ryan pleads him not to when joe decides to she goes in with him because she loves him now this is where the movie should end but unfortunately the cheesy ending bug comes in the volcano blows the couple out and into the ocean where they land on joe luggage they float to another part of the island as they watch lava pouring out of the volcano towards the villagers give this movie see it only if you re film buff that enjoys bad movie every now and then or if you really like tom hanks or meg ryan
flubber is the second best example of how to take all the life out of film remake an adaptation and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney it the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids but anyone else will feel left out as it boring slow and incredibly lifeless what could be film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water and it shame because it could have been great film hypothetically mean flubber as you probably know is remake of the disney classic never saw the absent minded professor where well absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as flubber you know flying rubber the new one keeps the basic plot but appears to have added lot else like more absent mindedness on the part of the proffessor some more villains and several show stopping moments like big rumba with the flubber and some more elaborate setups none which really make it any better but instead make it worse the basic plot revolves around college professor philip brainerd robin williams who creates lots and lots of inventions but is sadly absent minded in fact he forgotten his wedding to the college president sara jean reynolds indie actress marcia gay harden two times before he forgets it again at the beginning doesn this warrant some kind of mental treatment anyway on his wedding day the third one he invents the flubber which not only bounces off of everything like super ball on speed but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in the abyss philip believes that this invention once fully realized will save his college which is in threat of being shut down by millionaire tycoon villain chester hoenicker raymond barry which is ironically enough the same college his brat son will wheaton thought he was dead goes to through plot twist hoenicker goons named smith and wesson ha ha what great sense of humor this film has who are played by clancy brown and ted levine both who needed the pay check discover it the hard way and try to steal for hoenicker who wants it just cause he evil enough sub plot involves philip attempts to win back sara who angry at him and with good reason but who is being seduced by who is basically philip belloq wilson croft christopher mcdonald playing the hysterically suave yet unsuave asswhole once again and in another subplot philip day timer robot weebo voiced by the one and only jodi benson falls in love with him yuckity yuck what most pathetic about this film is how dull it is you don need to be cynical college student to be able to see right through this film which is another in long line of cheap attempts at making quick buck by disney who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry half assedly re mixing classics or non classics for distribution to the general public who sadly eats it all up earlier in 97 they released jungle jungle an adaptation of really awful french film un indien dans la ville which yeah improved over the original but not by much disney in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now only creatively in the rush to ship out film for distribution disney has forgotten to give this film little thing called magic such scenes as dancing flubber flying car basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze delight or even cause people to laugh sat there the entire film stone faced chuckling perhaps twice and shaking my head at all the bad jokes who could really laugh at scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry didn think so it doesn help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable philip is not lovable absent minded professory just really dumb man being played by robin williams williams is brilliant comic actor okay brilliant actor in general but here he given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something and other times act sad those times he not bad but what are we supposed to think of man who forgotten his wedding thrice maybe it was funny and or respectable in the 60s like disney and usually enjoy their films not only animated but live action and their recent films save for hercules which was good but not great have been worse than lackluster they ve been pathetic jungle jungle is probably the worst film saw last year flubber probably second what do they need to do perhaps create something new get writers who can write something that universally entertaining films like the parent trap and mary poppins are films that are live action or in the latter case mix of both but even can still watch them because they re not only written to be magical to children but to be fun to adults what more torturous that taking child to film that insults you and annoys you at every turn and my god couldn they have done something else with edie mcclurg
going to start this review off with hypothetical question let say you ve just been in car accident and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious your friends have left to go get help and you re waiting to see if the victim wakes up tow truck comes along and the driver hops out of the truck to see what going on he then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck do you run away screaming for your life staying away from the main road run away but not too fast and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you stop to catch your breath try to negotiate with the psycho and when that fails start running away again all the while staying on the main road if you answered you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of texas chainsaw massacre the next generation and will likely hate this movie however if you answered prepare to enjoy film made with idiots like you in mind texas chainsaw massacre the next generation is being called sequel but it really more of remake of the original there few changes here and there but it essentially the same even the infamous meathook scene has been re created the story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere needless to say they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family much carnage ensues to call this movie inept would be putting it mildly in addition to the laughably idiotic situation mentioned in my hypothetical question there is moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere it just swoops down and kills him with its wheel no explantion is given as to who was flying it or why he she is going around killing people with the planes wheel the dialogue is even more atrocious zellwegger who is kidnapped by the family early on keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people when you re surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses would think that rationality would go out the window speaking of going out the window there is scene in which zellwegger jumps out window apparently the stunt double had little trouble because she visibly gets stuck in the window the director quickly cuts to wide shot where the stunt double doesn get caught in the window this was one of many glaring inconsistencies there are so many in fact that if were to name them all this review would be several pages long the only reason am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey he plays member of the family with hydraulic leg home made might add and is so completely over the top you can help but be amazed by his performance he obviously had lot of fun with this part and it really shows he makes jack nicholson portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in the shining look restrained in comparison for horror movie texas chainsaw massacre the next generation contains surprisingly little gore in fact in contains none there little blood here and there but that as far as it goes which leads me to believe that the budget must have been astonishingly low and it shows everything about the movie looks cheap from the sets to the costumes especially leatherface once frightening and nightmare inducing he now as terrifying as dame edna do yourself favor and take pass at this remake check out the far superior original instead
susan granger review of session usa films sometimes you just get more than your bargained for like when boston based hazmat elimination run by scottish actor peter mullan and his trusty assistant david caruso assures town engineer paul guilifoyle that they can remove insidious asbestos fibers from victorian hospital facility in week erected in 1871 deserted and decomposing since 1985 the danvers mental hospital is one of the most malevolent locations ever chosen for film the structure is so massive with its labyrinth of rubble strewn corridors collapsing floors stagnant pools of water isolation cells and ominous surgical chambers where experimental pre frontal lobotomies were performed that their task seems impossible within that time frame and each member of their inexperienced crew stephan gevedon brandon sexton iii and josh lucas is coping with his own personal demons as one by one their minds seem to be affected by the grim areas in which they re working the film title is derived from salvaged reel to reel audio recorded sessions involving the demonic possession of young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities by the time session occurs so do dreadful disasters filmmaker brad anderson obviously envisioned this as gruesome chainsaw massacre type ghost story but the script lacks structure and isn particularly scary the conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing on the granger movie gauge of to 10 session is dark gloomy silly me at first thought that the original name of the danvers lunatic asylum bore some reference to mrs danvers the creepy housekeeper played by judith anderson in alfred hitchcock truly terrifying rebecca that also involved cavernous mansion called manderley
by the time dennis quaid the ostensible star of switchback makes his first appearance at about the 22 minute mark you may find yourself wondering why he bothered after all writer director jeb stuart has already set up fairly promising pair of parallel story lines the first finds amarillo texas sheriff buck olmstead lee ermey facing hotly contested election battle just as brutal double homicide is discovered at motel in his jurisdiction as olmstead begins his investigation we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects lane dixon jared leto is an enigmatic young hitchhiker bob goodall danny glover is the jovial motorist who offers lane ride from texas to his utah destination all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other protagonist but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years he not supposed to be tracking him any more according to the bureau they ve got their man but lacrosse has very important reason for believing otherwise two months earlier lacrosse own son was kidnapped by the killer and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere lacrosse knows his killer work and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game it wouldn be fair to reduce everything that wrong with switchback to quaid presence but it pretty good place to start there reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center as dramatic actor dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is perpetual tight jawed sourpuss pucker we can tell he grim because every word comes out in an eastwood esque rasp more flexible performer might have given weight to the character pulling the audience into his haunted intensity making switchback _his_ film quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated it tough to become emotionally invested in character turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is big bowl of bran flakes even without quaid it doesn appear that switchback would have stayed on course the early scenes between leto and glover have lively energy building our curiosity over which man the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor is the real threat unfortunately stuart tips his hand far too early in the game both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal once the mystery of the killer identity is dispatched the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable in fact stale and predictable describes the direction that switchback takes in general falling back on far too common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere climactic fistfight on board freight train and edgy law enforcement agents it too bad stuart wasn willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film played with atypical restraint by lee ermey he wonderful unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled film maker willing to take few risks with his casting and story telling instead stuart places his trust in name star who can carry the material maybe next time he ll throw away that one crucial page in the script the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up perfectly good story
gregg araki the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made so why did see his latest teen bisexual angst opus first of all some of the reviews were fairly positive also the cast consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars including christopher knight eve plumb shannen doherty and david leisure was promising last of all wanted to give arraki one more chance mean the guy can be that untalented can he the answer to that question is three letters long nowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles since arraki doesn know how to make anything coherent it hard to describe the plot let just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend won make commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as teen who has chance encounter with famous tv star he turns out to be nice guy who doesn care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans this story has shocking twist and tragic end that did not see coming it is the first time ever felt any compassion for character created by arraki and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft he works better with the camera this time around especially in the early scenes halfway through the film didn necessarily find myself enjoying the film but it seemed like considerable improvement on the doom generation then as the movie went on arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads twisted sex games and alien abductions it sad because he almost actually had some decent material here but he ruined it with his usual in your face such renegade maverick filmmaker look what can do attitude the performances are generally better than in the doom generation which isn saying much at least we don have to suffer jonathan am the most hideous man in america schaech we are however treated to another round of james more wooden than keanu duval sarah lassez gives the best performance in the film and kathleen robertson formerly of 90210 and now arraki wife and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess of the tv star cameos john ritter is the most interesting as deranged right wing tv evangelist if prefer nowhere to the doom generation it is only in the way that would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture maybe greg arraki doesn want you to like his characters maybe he wants to laugh and make fun of those of us who try to care about them maybe he just wanted to piss me off if so he was successful
sometimes when decide to write short story or poem think of title first and then think of subject to go with it it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence wouldn be surprised if couple of guys got together and created the opening credits and then someone saw it and made up story to go along with it the title sequence is so good so ominous and original that it had me engrossed before the picture even began of course my attention dwindled shortly into the film disturbing behavior like so many thrillers starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous it teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex it suspense film with no suspense it an evil small town story with no story to speak of it disaster listless and uninspired disaster that just barely misses one stardom because of few good sequences mercifully short running time and one terrific set of opening credits our main man is fellow named steve clark blandly played by jimmy marsden he moves to small town with his family after tragically his brother shoots himself steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother we learn this through strange home video like nightmares that he has occasionally the big trial for steve is of course to fit in at school and make new friends marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail so he seems poor casting choice for social reject as social reject he falls in with some pretentious dope smoking philosophers gavin nick stahl and rachel katie holmes gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks known as the mavi ribboners are actually bunch of zombies assimilating new members into their group while sporadically killing innocent people so it up to our group of mismatched protagonists to solve the mystery and do something about it by the end of it all something has happened and things have been explained but the film still doesn make any sense disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg ve seen his name around recently he was one of the toucher uppers on the armageddon script and imagine that for the most part he knows what he doing when it comes to screenwriting he did however have complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film and then decided to actually take the time to write it out evil small town films are pretty common the last one phantoms is also dismal failure but it takes lot of skill to make the formula work rosenberg script is complete mess lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization and it makes no sense nor is their any purpose when things are finally explained there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks but the film never explains exactly what is happening they get strapped to chairs microchip is inserted into their eyes and poof they become sex crazed superviolent machine like creatures the doctor responsible for all this dr caldicott bruce greenwood must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is step up from the way high school jocks actually behave or perhaps this is the only realistic element in the film much of the writing is simply bad and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act in one terrible scene gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques while pointing them out in the cafeteria up front should say that in four years of high school did not eat in the cafeteria even once that aside the various social groups he points out are general uninteresting and poorly shown for instance he points to the nerds who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops it such an obvious cliche that can believe rosenberg even bothered most of the dialogue is forced no one says bite me anymore and none of the scenes have any degree of wit this picture is not inspired and most scenes flop from one to the other with no sense of momentum or energy the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter who apparently likes his films dry horror films should at least exploit violence but this one is shockingly timid there are few good scenes though such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum this is however the most forced scene in the film for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn also liked the school janitor character played by william sadler he has few lines that are surprisingly thought provoking the acting is largely waste of talent marsden is as said bland thought not particularly bad bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted stahl and holmes both show they have talent but the direction isn good enough to hone in on their skills stahl performance seems more like parody of high school potheads none of these characters expand beyond their one dimension and frankly watching cardboard cut outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn all that cool disturbing behavior is wreck of film and it started out wreck before shooting even began surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make good film or that it would make lot of money at the box office it not boring or even blatantly awful but it an uninspired lump of film it sure starts off nicely but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable so if you go to see this film take my advice appreciate the credit sequence and pray it never ends

note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned to assess alex cox film the winner as loser would be so indolent it would be derisive it would be glib it would be dismissive it would be entirely accurate rarely have seen film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner would be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious unfunny and unengaging the film attempts to be fresh and quirky utilising myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous the film is set in las vegas and the focus in the winner is on philip vincent onofrio an aloof naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck he virtually cannot lose at the tables despite this prodigious talent philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities consequently he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent louise rebecca demornay sultry lounge singer insinuates herself into philip life for the purpose of swindling him while philip estranged brother and conveniently louise ex beau johnny michael madsen arrives on the scene to add some colour johnny also happens to be toting their father corpse sans one hand meanwhile philip is also befriended by trio of low rent opportunists frank whaley billy bob thornton and richard edson who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddy gift with the dice serenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner delroy lindo it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorsese casino which details the organization hierarchy of casino operations he is the eye in the sky it could be maddening to endure film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation but fortunately this is not the case in the winner if only because our sadsack hero is such sap not even remotely sympathetic or compelling it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate and the would be swindlers of philip fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with complete sense of disinterest it is shame as the winner features talented cast mr onofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with huge range mr lindo has remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears mr madsen ms demornay and mr whaley have all done good work in the past none of the actors in the winner are in top form here and this film won likely be prized addition to their respective resumes director alex cox does what he can with wendy riss screenplay and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of stage play was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one while tedious the film is well paced and does not meander but it would be near impossible task for mr cox or for that matter virtually any other director that comes to mind to overcome the film widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization to his credit my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others screened to be honest though couldn begin to isolate what could be done to this film to improve it assume that throwing the whole thing out and starting over is out of the question the winner has apparently played on cable television in the united states and is beginning limited theatrical release at the time of this writing the film has nice upbeat score by pray for rain but am honestly not being facetious when state that the thing treasured most about my screening of the winner was the bag of popcorn upon which was munching
what to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography ie the garbage known as snuff films nothing right what to like about film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography well nothing so why make it hollywood there no reason why the average sane movie goer will be interested in such topic no one is going to enrich their life or have good time by watching material such as this the lack of quality filmmaking in 8mm from technical to acting stands out even more when you consider the star writer and supporting cast all reputable but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again like paul schrader schumacher has his moments but they re few and far far between basically this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it why not walk out well this wouldn be thorough review about thoroughly bad movie here why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of 8mm first thing if you don heed my advice then understand what you re about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud it not easy to watch didn know the details of the story beforehand but at least my ignorance can help others now the ha plot revolves around tom welles nicolas cage as surveillance expert and private investigator rich old woman discovers snuff film in her late husband safe she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl it had to be young girl didn it schumacher who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead she horrified that her husband would have owned such film in 8mm of course and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find family man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque murder let me backtrack for moment see snuff films are pornos with violent twist people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead however the deaths are often staged and in those cases special effects and good acting make all the difference very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard to find movies the thought of this industry makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review but ll swallow my bile and move on welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry you think he sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him he comes across smut clerk max joaquin phoenix who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze after lot of digging and bribing welles finds the men who are responsible for making this and other snuff films skip ahead skip ahead skip ahead led by dino velvet peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance and star torturer machine christopher bauer they have big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue the movie doesn end there unfortunately because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do become vigilante this film doesn draw you in it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close it is possible to like film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ie se7en but it takes large measure of restraint schumacher has none and larger amount of talent schumacher has little by those jabs not only referring to his stylish destruction of the batman franchise but time to kill was an immensely overrated disappointment for guy who gets so much studio money his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled good screenwriter and good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter writer andrew kevin walker didn recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for 95s twisted thriller se7en director schumacher doesn have that innate ability to make you watch things you don really want to see like better directors are capable of doing he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don see is more frightening than what we do especially when it scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered however gratuitous is joel middle name he must think that not flaunting hard core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint no he doesn go that far but we see enough unpleasantness he doesn leave much to the imagination it manipulating to hurt or kill young girls just to get the audience on the side of murderous vigilante the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ha ha craft case in point shot of christian fellowship bus good right drives away to reveal one of the villains bad right see no subtlety does joel think we re stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery who do we root for in this mess is there anybody out there it not all the director fault though why did the actors sign up for this nicolas cage is an oscar winner for cryin out loud if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda what is cage supposed to be in this movie whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash he was so solid as concerned father in civil action guess ol nic pete and jim were promised mountain of money or they re suckers or they just don care there are moments albeit brief ones where this rises above the wasteland catherine keener is good although too quick to threaten divorce as mrs wells baby cindy is obviously cute and wells devout love of his daughter is sweet the mother amy norton of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter this film has an appropriate blue toned washed out look like payback which was much better movie the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue but at other times it rough during some conversations close ups and wide shots are not cut very well making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren good and whose timing was half second off such technical error indeed stands out speaking of standing out don believe the misleading trailers there not much action here occasionally yes but not as often as your tv will have you believe after seeing 8mm may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again is that positive well if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing dirty movie again is their motive they ve done swell job here it ll be long time before give schumacher film another chance unless lose my mind and become seriously depraved but today not depraved so ask why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it sure that somewhere right now there some pretty sick crap going on but that doesn mean need to know about it yes mr walker your script tells us that there are some screwed up folks out there yes mr walker the proverbial monster doesn look like we expect him to you said all that in 1995 move on this film serves no purpose it doesn entertain it doesn teach us anything it doesn make statement beyond the obvious this stuff is bad approach only if this film awakens the authorities to find way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile that not likely to happen though so 8mm is indeed scummy waste of money orson welles said years ago in tribute to film to movies to good movies if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in hole like snuff films 8mm should never have been made now excuse me while go try to forget ever saw it useless trivia joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme he used it in batman forever in batman robin in time to kill in falling down and it rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow
in the james bond film diamonds are forever tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads bond response is that it doesn really matter as long as collars and cuffs match well collars and cuffs don match in the real blonde what might have sounded good on paper ends up as largely unfunny meandering comedy on screen the film supposedly satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business is wafer thin it plays like an ally mcbeal episode dragged out to the nth degree replete with few unnecessary fantasy sequences writer director tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is fresh idea it isn the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary matthew modine plays joe struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent he 35 with no agent and no credits since he too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas that not really acting he tells his girlfriend of six years mary catherine keener with whom he bickers constantly about sex but they need the money so joe finally agrees to take part in madonna video but it not really madonna starring in the video but lookalike played by elizabeth berkley still trying to jump start her career after showgirls this points out how artificial this whole business is one supposes dicillo has referred to the real blonde as off kilter but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff the film which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere is remarkably on kilter and with perhaps the single exception of the always likable modine who not afraid to stand around in very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks the entire cast is vague and uninteresting catherine keener who appeared in dicillo previous three films including the brilliant living in oblivion is at her most annoying in the real blonde look at her closely she really can act at all her reactions are all wrong almost always out of sync with her co stars she reacts too soon or too late to lines and situations she moves her eyes or her mouth far too much she frowns she yells she babbles she blows chunks maxwell caulfield plays joe actor waiter buddy bob the one obsessed with dating natural blonde bob personality not to mention caulfield acting ability parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera passion crest stiff and uninteresting maybe that the point daryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title soap dish who beds bob both on and off camera hannah looks about fifty in this movie she only 37 why is that almost all the women in the film wear tops that show their nipples why is that marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer and so on the best parts of the the real blonde are the beginning and the end brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog there more depth and sincerity in single close up of her expressive face than in the entire film while this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters lives the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if it funny
if were to plot graph of year against movie plot ridiculity for hollywood movies you ll probably see line with constant gradient now if were to plot that same graph for the movies that the michael bay jerry bruckheimer has made over the last years that line would be exponential in growth the team started out with the will smith vehicle bad boys which was no more than 2hr long action music video nevertheless entertaining then came the rock where audiences flocked to see nicholas cage team up with sean connery against some terrorizing general fighting over some stupid cause con air was ridiculousy dumb in its premise but it did have fun moments and who can forget the nursery rhyme sang by that psycho killer played by steve buscemi while these movies worked because there was something better to cover up the dirt armageddon does not very much like deep impact meteor is heading towards earth and they didn realize it until 18 days from impact deep impact settled with the modest meteor size as large as the city of new york but armageddon just had to be bigger well about the size of texas that kinda meteor whould probably knock earth out of its orbit the panic of this sighting spurs the idea of landing people on the meteor drill it then nuke it sounds familiar and who better to do such job than harry stamper bruce willis your very own oil driller extraordinaire and his team of macho misfits nursing the tagline `there ain nothin on this planet that harry can drill in that 18 days harry group was split into teams trained for deep space flight and finally blasted into space in with special drilling vehicles on new space shuttles the main relationship drama of armageddon is formed within the relationship of harry and grace to give you an idea works for harry and loves grace harry daughter the problem is harry hates to see his daughter hanging around some scruffy grunt like himself for the rest of her life so while and harry struts it out grace is place in position where she is unable to take sides so she remains seated in the nasa control tower crying over both of them in about 80% of the movie the human elements this movie tries to inject proves to be nothing more than just an excuse for more slow mo and gold tinted photography the anguish of the world is potrayed with scenes of people praying running for their lives or just sitting still staring at the sky sounds fine right know but it looks too out of place on screen too staged if you were to ask yourself `what the difference between armageddon and r&b music video you probably just said `the music not surprising since michael bay is child of that industry and has actually managed to transpose his mtv skills to screen successfully his foray into armageddon just proves that he doesn when to stop well there really nothing much to sum up here the stock aitken waterman of hollywood movies have projected their art form into ridiculity beyond the plane believability where people still accept even if they didn believe deep impact was ridiculous in most aspects and believe the makers know this the thing is they decided to shroud myth and fantasy with purely believable human tale of suffering and coming in terms with ones problems which ultimately brought it above the ashes which it had initially put itself in armageddon is an overcrowded loud messy preposterously manipulative waste of money and deserves to remain in that same pile of ash =20 if you have planned to watched this over deep impact because of liv tyler bruce willis or the tagline from the makers of `the rock please catch deep impact before it finishes its run it may be the only meteor worth watching in long long time if you have to see it please bring ear plugs and some aspirins for the vertigo expect armageddon ld to retail at s$19 90 at carrefour come release time gee even that not worth it
tina fetch me the axe favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 paramount soon realised they had problem on their hands it wasn just the film disappointing box office performance indeed in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two three even six times no the main problem was that what was intended as serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year in desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming mommie dearest the biggest mommie of them all executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn but it was all too late mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history unfortunately faye dunaway energetic at times ridiculously over the top performance is about the film only redeeming feature based on daughter christina crawford trashy biography mommie dearest chronicles series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother if you believe this movie it was life was racked by obsession lonliness child abuse and rampant egomania the film begins with crawford adopting two children and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother will joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves you see but that about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film end the script laboured over by four writers bad sign in itself is poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum frank perry direction is no more than competent and dunaway bitchy lines aside the dialogue is flat and uninvolving in fairness the film second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop degree empathy for its characters when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling joan visits and keeps in touch not helping her financially but encouraging christina own acting and career ambitions crawford does seem to care about her daughter but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers ah but there is dunaway performance and what delicious piece of campery it often is having just been sacked by her studio after run of box office duds crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she making spotting young tree she doesn like the look of she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line tina fetch me the axe with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling in the film most outrageous scene joan realises that some of her daughter clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers oh dear sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum doesn it this time she gives her daughter horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst no wire hangers ever and later when the board of her late husband company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship she displays superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring don fuck with me fellas oh joy something of camp classic then but if that not you re cup of tea then mommie dearest doesn have too much to recommend it better you see the real crawford in the women 1939 mildred pierce 1945 or whatever happened to baby jane 1962 great films distinguished by great performances and far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perry shrieking piece of tabloid froth
phil radmar jao has hairy problem his beard is growing so rapidly that he has to shave every hour he recently met the author of non fiction book on lycanthropy also referred to in the movie as werewolfism and phil now believes that his problem is that he has become werewolf using enough chains and handcuffs to be hit at sadomasochists convention he ties himself in at night lest his urges overcome him and phil is just one of the many quirky characters that inhabit shopping for fangs made on pittance the film features an almost exclusively asian american cast as directed by quentin lee and justin lin the movie is so amateurishly bad that it could almost be parody of indie films jeanne chin plays katherine meek and soft spoken wife who worries that her husband is unhappy with her because she is not giving him enough sex we know this through the endless scenes of her confessing her sins real and imagined to her therapist as her husband jim clint jung plays muscle man with macho crudeness the picture is filled with stereotypes there mysterious loud mouthed waitress with big platinum blonde wig who brags to everyone she meets that she lesbian she spends most of the movie putting the moves on her favorite customer gay guy and the lone beyaz with major role the author on werewolfism has wildly unkempt orangey blonde curly hair from its opening scene of an attempted rape at knifepoint to its easy to guess ending twist the script rarely has anything to offer the story is so minimally developed that it feels almost like the actors were ad libbing one can only hope that the directors next film will have some substance and some credible acting shopping for fangs runs 30 it is rated for sex violence and profanity and would be fine for older teenagers
writer director lawrence kasdan had hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s yes that right he co wrote raiders of the lost ark 10 the empire strikes back 10 and return of the jedi 10 now with this film it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing and guess what he succeeds once again plot man with shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into small american town where he pretends to be licensed psychologist to an open armed swarm of people with problems it isn long before he befriends the small town billionaire folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients critique this film is not comedy it is drama say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer you would think that this film secures its base in humor but unfortunately for us it does not it is serious film seriously flawed if you ask me but digress which offers couple of witty quips to keep you awake but overall just sits there now on to my review this movie sucks because it was slow and boring starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst and certified it all with many predictable ending have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture but whatever it was he missed anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff piece which on good day might be described as predictably digestible it no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as comedy it sucks as drama and bored my movie cohort right to sleep ve given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks first of all couldn help but think about how much the lead actor loren dean looked like young charles grodin he even acted like him save for the dry sardonic wit this kept me interested in watching him at least number two and this one is really shallow seemed to be geared that way as well there were quite few titshots as they would say back in high school and god help me if can get enough of those in an aimless drama and three and this one surprised me the most actor ted danson cameo yes he will always be sam malone to us real fans was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as different person different asshole but different person nonetheless if ever you rent this movie one day promise you won throw away your hard earned money at the theaters wait for his scene because it actually pretty good other than that drab drab drab and drab even jason lee personal favorite of mine was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in while well at least he finally came out and did some real skateboarding in this movie oh yeah and guess that the fourth point in my rating anyway if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist this film your bag otherwise skip it and see analyze this 10 again now there great shrink movie little known facts about this film and its stars three company fans alert terri from the tv show also known as actress priscilla barnes plays small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film the scene is actually fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage so stay tuned kids also it is to note that the actress was once named penthouse pet of the month in march of 1976 she was known as one joann witty back then she originally from jersey who the hell is loren dean the dude who plays mumford in this film you got me but all know is that he was born in las vegas in 1969 and played the character of billy bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name jason lee was born in the state of california in the year of 1971 he was professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats 10 and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp he been in every kevin smith film except for clerks 10 listen closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film the ballooning actor formerly known as pruit taylor vince make reference to the lost ark which is obviously an in joke considering that it is the writer director of this film lawrence kasdan who co wrote raiders of the lost ark 10 kasdan also played the part of dr green in 1997 as good as it gets 10 ted danson also played the role of lawyer peter lowenstein in kasdan 1981 directorial debut body heat starring sexy kathleen turner and william hurt

when you ve run out of old tv shows to turn into movies guess you try video games why did go to see mortal kombat annihilation the quest to seek an answer to this query may prove better movie that the one just saw this film was bunch of fighting yelling special effects and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack the plot is fairly simple portal has opened between our world and the outworld allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn brian thompson to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity the good guys led by sorcerer rayden james remar and human mortal liu kang robin shou must take the fight to outworld where the fate of both worlds will be determined here the catch they must reunite princess katana talia soto who on the good side with her resurrected mother queen sindel musetta vander who on the bad side for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanity safety for another generation how this is supposed to work still have no idea but liked katana line knew love would keep us together since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and got good laugh there are some seriously stupid things in this movie take for example transportation system which utilizes the inner winds generated by earth magma flows you get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast how fast as katana says you will be moving so fast it will be as if you are not moving at all what later sonya blade sandra hess goes to find jax lynn kirmizi williams otherwise known as saber on tv american gladiators at medical research facility on the island of oahu how do we know this is where she went there sign on the facility perimeter fence that reads medical research facility oahu hawaii remember this is not caption but an actual sign guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are there lot of major flipping action too the first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another do they land and immediately get into the fighting does one of them land first and catch the other off guard do they collide in mid air no apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away why did they need those metal balls to travel everyone could have just flipped from point to point have to admit the fight scenes are pretty good although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics the movie thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly ouch was the most common expletive heard when screened this one you could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights not plot would be the main draw since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next it seems that all there is in this movie maybe it is as had mentioned the acting is bad there not one solid performance in the film although williams as jax was pretty funny after fight between sonya and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling jax says you look good in mud no really you do remar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang brian thompson who has played good guys bad guys and even an alien on tv the files but always some muscle bound behemoth is your average evil demi god but it more the script fault than his own that he doesn have anything original to say the one really impressive thing about this movie is that there is not one swear word in the whole hour and half another thing which should be noted is that for all its punching and kicking blood only appears in one scene all in all mortal kombat annihilation is loud violent shallow and marketed toward kids hey just like the video game
the swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest very tim burton movie but alas no caped crusader descends to save this film instead it skeletal housemaid julia roberts who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling of dr jekyll and mr hyde for few fleeting maddening moments director stephen frears dangerous liaisons gets everything just right the tone the colors the characters all the ingredients to make most powerful potion out of valerie martin best selling novel yet it fizzles too quickly the volatile mixture losing potency from the very first scene casting is large part of the problem the story all but collap ses around ms roberts she doesn have the range for this kind of drama her accent also comes and goes though it nowhere near as glaring as the total lack of chemistry between her and co star john malkovich he looks the same in both of his roles an incredible fact that missed by everyone in the story the very british supporting cast including michael gambon and george cole gives credibility to the smaller parts glenn close also appears as madam that the good doctor calls upon her performance is as close to intentional camp as the movie ever gets and as bonus offers likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville in the live action 101 dalmantions the biggest botch in mary reilly is suspense there is none no terror no tension nothing without any weight wit or wonder to propel the story the viewer is left with little more to do than pay attention to the period detail few buckets of blood and stuart craig fabulously dreary production design all of which gets old after about an hour at which point recommend leaving the pacing in the second half is especially abominable if you do stick it through your sole reward is half hokey special effect depicting the infamous transformation mr frears reportedly recut his film several times missing several release dates in the process obviously no one advised him to throw up his hands and just turn the whole damned thing over to mel brooks blucher mary reilly is the second robert louis stevenson story of the month after muppet treasure island perhaps mr frears should consult with brian henson on future projects daresay that even ms piggy is better choice for certain roles than julia roberts and she does have great chop
guilt guilt is something felt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time the penultimate thriller basic instinct made my last few teenage years worth living but know so well that it terrible film made by terrible director incapable of feeling guilt verhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls and on november seventh 1997 unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me who cannot control the urge to see giant bug movies the pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year simple beyaz on siyah title card reads starship troopers my friends and speculated that the night before the prints were shipped verhoeven realized he forgot the credits is this how hundred million dollar movie should open were the rest of the film that subdued starship troopers is about group of beyaz blond haired himbos and bimbos who all have spanish last names they graduate high school join the military and then rather curiously decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all lifeforms on that planet the story is so incomprehensible and told so bombastically it akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in foreign tongue aside club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasn changed in the future one plus starship troopers contains some very funny sequences specifically the newsreels of the future hysterically funny actually but the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between the storytelling lacks focus to say the least the politics of the film are scary the actions of the major female characters are dictated by their out of control libidos there even creepy sex scene the lovely dina meyer makes out nude with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater just the way he seems to like it use the term sickening because van dien is the least appealing actor ve encountered in big budget picture all chiseled features and machismo he even barks eulogy at funeral like military orders of course verhoeven probably the one to blame and perhaps jealous because so disgusting at any rate movie called starship troopers shouldn be about sex exactly ten years ago verhoeven made robocop which was about nothing but skillfully made and oddly moving and rated despite its goofy premise maybe it asking too much for verhoeven to make pg movie then he master of insipid violence however ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it
what your favorite new york moment this one climbing the charts starring john cusack kate beckinsale eugene levy molly shannon directed by peter chelsom rated pg 13 there no doubt that 95% of romantic comedies follow distinct pattern guy sees girl guy wants girl guy goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl guy gets girl in rare cases the genders are flipped predictability is given rarely though is romantic comedy as cheap as obvious or as pointless as serendipity film that uses its theme as an excuse for its plot contrivances lightweight doesn begin to describe it this is like anti gravity it begins in new york city bloomingdale product placement that rivals cast away fedex for sheer blatancy jonathan trager john cusack and sara thomas kate beckinsale both go for the same pair of gloves after going through the perfunctory motions jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them go out for ice cream followed by ice skating jonathan falls hard and sara is charmed when she writes her name and number down on piece of paper truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand she takes this as sign from fate that they shouldn be together jonathan is flabbergasted to pacify him she comes up with an idea jonathan will write his number on dollar bill which she will promptly spend when she gets home she will write her name and number inside book love in the time of cholera and sell it to used bookstore if the bill gets back to her or the book to him it will mean that they are meant to be together three years later both sara and jonathan are now engaged to other love interests both realize they aren content both go looking for the other what happens now is so absurd that almost tempted to recommend the film for the sake of seeing it the two of them run circles around each other in set of incredible coincidences that would describe as contrivances if it weren for the film oh so cleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around serendipity of course since the movie is about fate the screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases not buying it there no suspense in any of this because we know exactly what going to happen but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly adorable non story into our heads instead of will they meet the question we re asking is when will they meet already to make matters worse every coincidence is telegraphed from mile away by the last reel was bored enough to actively look for signs that something else incredible was going to happen cusack is fine and beckinsale at least isn saddled with another lumbering clunky screenplay she had bad luck what with brokedown palace and pearl harbor on her resume just an inanely pointless one serendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing eugene levy who plays snarky bloomingdale salesman what the interest in watching movie that spirals around and around predestined no pun intended conclusion serendipity wants to tug at the heartstrings but it only tests our patience
didn come into city of angels expecting greatness ve never seen wim wenders wings of desire the classic movie upon which city is loosely based then again have seen enough stories which are based upon similar plot device with the little mermaid both the disney version and the original folktale being among them that had some high expectations about the possible power such story of impossible love can hold unfortunately city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them the plot for those that couldn tell from the previews revolves around the angel seth played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage who in the midst of his angelic duties falls in love with heart surgeon named maggie meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally of course his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her watch her buy groceries only to disappear in the blink of an eye their love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human using this framework as jumping off point the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire the joys of being human and the definition of perfection the first half of the movie succeeds on most points cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn know feelings so can really express preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hang dog expressions unfortunately cage takes the intensity too far sometimes and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive as maggie ryan manages to be convincing as heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost patient on the operating table despite having done everything right her beauty unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss is mature intelligent and winning likewise some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film when the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen the audience experiences little of what it must be like to be an angel the beautiful camera work shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels also gives us sense of the unique wonder angels feel the film begins to lose its way though when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie the grand angelic perspective gets lost except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angel eyes the movie devolves into an examination of how seth can feel the world or more importantly he can feel maggie he can smell her hair feel her touch or taste the pears she eats this change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seth intense longing but in doing so the conflict disappears if he wants maggie so badly then why doesn her just make the leap and become human after all what so great about being an angel sure you get to sit on marlboro signs but what that compared to getting to be with meg ryan and from there once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur it all downhill the philosophy becomes heavy handed the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep and the plot twists simply attempt to yank few more tears into the audience hankie it the last thirty minutes of the movie then that wrecks the film feel like the writer by pulling out all the melodramatic stops has robbed me of what could have been genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level came out feeling robbed seeing so much possibility in film becoming nothing could go on longer but don want to ruin the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on city of angels then is paradox it well acted particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type casting as happy go lucky fallen angel well filmed and based on wonderful idea all these possibilities though are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up
plot summary the year is 2024 the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by shield invented by connor mccleod the shield although saving lives has made the atmosphere hot and humid connor is mortal and tired old man who has given up hope on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of terrorist organisation they have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist like zeit get it they fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield katana meanwhile fearing connor would return sets out himself to kill the highlander if you have never seen it being fan of highlander and mr connery was in the cinema as soon as could to see highlander ii the quickening wish it had been quicker feel whatever else you can say about film bad script bad music etc if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so the time mr connery is on the screen for is worth watching the plot sounds little ridiculous but was willing to give it chance maybe they could pull it off instead find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film it as if they are different people with the same names witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance where is the attitude of who wants to live forever when love must die gone to the love sub plot must have had footage cut out the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying still want to know why connor coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by quick chop to the neck know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first to be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the world worst shot meanwhile connor develops luke skywalker like powers of laser beam deflection as for bad guys we see rebellion on zeist crushed easier than grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist two assassins are sent presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems no more assassins are sent katana supposedly very powerful man goes himself to kill connor has he no more assassins has he no better why was the rebellion crushed so easily then michael ironside is totally unconvincing bring back the kurgan he seems like cartoon character and really isn that evil just stupid and violent we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening child again and killing lots of innocents yet he still seems like no threat perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn have been amiss with larry curly and mo so much for plot and characters the music is atrocious it is at best intrusive and at worst annoying bring back queen there was an audible sigh of relief when connor played queen track in juke box believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release the acting is at best flat except for mr connery lambert is uninteresting and when he delivered there can be only one this time around it just made me wish there had only been one highlander michael ironside is unconvincing sorry michael usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable so why 10 visually the film is interesting at all times it has blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film or is he smirking to himself his lines and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all but hey have done it for 12 million oh and agree with previous reviewer she does look like sharon stone but believe it is her first film incidentally there is line producer credited and hear rumours of highlander iii the wizard
200 cigarettes takes place on new year eve 1981 monica played by martha plimpton is having huge new year party everyone in town is trying to get there but some are caught up in other things this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes as we meet the characters headed towards the party we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal and not interesting at all this disappointed me greatly the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion lucy played by courtney love is with kevin played by paul rudd the two are in relationship that is more of friendship but starts to blossom into something more than that this subplot is extremely boring and dull and am getting quite sick of plots like that janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot dealing with kevin she plays ellie an ex girlfriend of kevin this subplot is completely waste of garofalo talent there was no point to it at all and it was hardly even in the movie when lucy runs into bartender played by ben affleck another subplot is formed the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monica party at the bar he runs into two more girls the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker but unfortunately due to the terrible acting of both of them don even remember their characters names ben affleck is good actor but his character doesn go anywhere so he doesn have much screen time to give good performance featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles and they are part of the reason the film is so bad christina ricci plays val and gaby hoffman plays stephie the two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost they meet some guys and end up going around with them all night this subplot was alright but it was quite annoying with stephie accent hoffman did an okay job of acting but ricci did good she was underused considering she is such wonderful actress another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy played by goldie hawn daughter and jack played by jay mohr jack is an actor who doesn care about the girls he goes out with he just likes dates for one night and the next day he doesn kate hudson is huge klutz she gets herself into very funny situations that are the funniest parts in the entire movie they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well this subplot could have been used more mainly due to hudson performance mohr wasn good but he wasn bad he was just alright which didn find acceptable there is not much to say about the performances in the film none of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not the only performances that can judge are christina ricci as always good performance kate hudson funny role courtney love mediocre performance and paul rudd annoying and overused performance was hoping for little more out of jaw mohr ben affleck casey affleck gaby hoffman dave chapelle and especially out of janeane garofalo the two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes martha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like was in the year 1981 the soundtrack is full of 1980 tunes ranging from want candy to tainted love the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s during the film often found myself asking the questions is there reason to this is there any moral story is there point are any of the events going on in the film necessary do care what lucy and kevin are going through the movie is extremely boring and by the time they reached eleven clock one hour before midnight could not wait for the movie to be over the plot is okay but the subplots make it terrible maybe if the film was about the party not about the people at the party it could have been lot better the bottom line just like slasher movie this 80s comedy is just one too many

seem to have glued myself to myself starring jason biggs seann william scott chris klein thomas ian nichols allyson hannigan shannon elizabeth natasha lyonne tara reid mena suvari eugene levy jennifer coolidge directed by rogers rated american pie reunites the cast members from american pie in different setting instead of being high school seniors looking to score before they graduate they are now past their first year of college and have gathered in beach house to enjoy the summer of their lives jim jason biggs is still an insecure geek looking to improve his performance oz chris klein is still the sweetest guy on the block having sickeningly saccharine phone conversations with his studying abroad girlfriend stifler seann william scott is still horny stoner kevin thomas ian nichols still has no personality and finch eddie kaye thomas still longs for stifler mom have missed anyone so obviously not much has changed this is not problem provided that the movie boasts the rapid fire hilarity and unexpectedly true sentiment of the original but american pie is the very definition of sequelitis it coarser yes and it pushes the envelope even more but its heart isn in it it easy cash to capitalize off the first film success but it would have been worthier investment to prolong the franchise by coming up with something original part of the reason why the film doesn work think is that while in the original the kids quest for sex was coming of age stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness here everything has been cheapened they behave like those idiot frat boys who kill themselves drinking they have no motivation except for sex sex beer and sex that not to say that you can make decent comedy from that premise but it is one of american pie undoings missing too is the sweetness that permeated american pie the this could be you quality of the main players here the characters are too aware of themselves as pop culture icons and they re even more one note stifler and finch are now caricatures while jim oz and kevin are forced to make awkward self discoveries at arbitrary moments none of them betraying what the writers think the audiences want to see and then there the soon to be notorious scene where jim superglues himself to himself which perfectly demonstrates yet another of the film ailments one that also permeated say it isn so director rodgers debut there fine line between comedy and abject humiliation and american pie is on the wrong side of it it hard to laugh at the characters when you are profoundly embarrassed for them shielded my eyes watching this more than have watching any horror movie if there one redeeming factor to american pie it the inimitable eugene levy as jim dad who pops in on jim as he about to score and utters lines like your mother and have been known to get frisky not so much anymore but and then when the girl parents walk in blurts out this must be your daughter didn get her name but hopefully my son did if only the rest of the movie had the wit and wisdom of levy performance this is an unworthy sequel to gross fest that brought back the raunchy teen comedy the box office of this onw should keep the genre going strong which is disappointing the genre needs hiatus filmmakers are getting lazy
ll be the first to admit it when you mention the book great expectations immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class where was confronted with torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch yes it classic of literature but it was rather dry one shoved down my young throat like spoonful of bitter medicine certainly the experience wasn truly that bad but to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book not going to tell the story the way it happened ll gonna tell it the way remember it anyway to return from nostalgia lane and get back to the present hollywood in it trendy attempt to modernize the classics now presents an updated film version of great expectations instead of pip this time the central character is named finn played as boy by jeremy kissner and by ethan hawke as an adult finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie or should that be mrs joe kim dickens and her boorish fisherman husband joe chris cooper the setting is the florida coast during the mid 70s finn is blooming artist and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish one of his two favorite subjects during one of these escapades he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal robert deniro borrowing page from the superhuman max cady deniro criminal has seemingly limitless lung capacity and favors hiding on the ocean floor ok maybe that an exaggeration but he certainly beats any of houdini records in the opening scenes of the film and that nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn motorboat but digress anyway finn does the convict good deed just to show that he really swell guy and then the plot moves on enter miss havisham or ms dinsmoor here anne bancroft abandoned at the altar some 26 years ago ms dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid with bizarre clothing eccentric mannerisms and few pounds of makeup anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role although she ends up nowhere near believable character she does add some humor to the film joe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner but the insane ms dinsmoor soon hires finn to be plaything for her niece estella raquel beaudene as young girl gwyneth paltrow as an adult for no apparent reason other than to provide the main plot of the film finn is instantly stricken for the estella perhaps it her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person or maybe finn has simply never met girl before in any case neither as children nor adults chemistry simply doesn exist between the two and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her even when as an adult finn arrives in new york at the behest of mysterious benefactor reacquaints himself with estella and draws her portrait in the nude there nothing in fact there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnear gay artist during similar scene in as good as it gets at this point the audience has grown as cold and detached as estella character and couldn care less about the two characters the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow she fails to imbue estella remote character in the book with even the vaguest traces of humanity there obviously something wrong when watching the film you re more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character without strong estella finn obsession seems baseless you wish he would just stop whining let estella marry his rival walter plane an oddly subdued hank azaria and just get on with his life in fact the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot finn relationship with his brother in law joe is interesting if bit stereotypical what more fascinating are his interactions with deniro although it only bit part it goes to show how much vitality strong actor can create it is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put lot of work in creating the imagery of the film some of the shots work but others are too obviously staged for example both of the water fountain scenes to have any impact finn art actually the creations of italian painter francesco clemente is used throughout the film but it mostly fails to have the intended effect we never see why finn would generate this style of art which is simultaneously crude and insightful as result it ends up as distant as the rest of the film modernizing the classics is currently in vogue just see william shakespeare romeo+juliet simply update the action to modern setting and apply plenty of modern rock but such adornments do little to perk up great expectations as much as dreaded the novel when first read it you probably be better off suffering though reading than watching this romanceless film
you damn dirty apes that just one of the inadvertenty hilarious lines from planet of the apes that taken on comedic context over time no one back then seemed to realize how over the top charlton heston acting style was but it shows now particularly in this mystery science theater 3000 wannabe that was taken for film masterpiece in its time actually winning one oscar for makeup no less and being nominated for couple others it also spawned multiple sequels like beneath the planet of the apes escape from the planet of the apes return of the planet of the apes beneath the escape from the return of the planet of the apes planet of the apes the next generation police academy of the apes the list goes on heston is an american astronaut who spends few thousand light years in space with his three companions and ends up on planet not too dissimilar from earth the thing is on this planet humans can talk or think and the guys in the gorilla masks are the dominant species heston companions are killed or turned into vegetables by the apon is imprisoned he surprises them all with his gift of speech making two primate scientists roddy mcdowall and kim hunter believe heston is the missing link between ape and man believe me we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for years when the two apes present the idea before judicial counsel the head ape being shakespearean actor maurice evans it is received as heresy for all good monkeys know god created ape in his image but heston has already seen cave that contains evidence that humans were originally the dominant species before apes ever gained the ability to speak and run for president and he takes them there holding up baby doll and yelling if humans couldn speak then how do you account for this talking doll and how do you account for your acting ability mr heston the absolute most laughable scene comes with the movie surprise conclusion won reveal the details except to say it involves heston falling to his knees on beach and yelling god damn you all to hell several times in succession the movie is atrocious and should only be viewed by those members of society who like to watch bad movies and laugh at them what makes planet of the apes even more amusing is that it was supposed to function as some sort of social irony condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution but let me tell you if darwin could see the ape masks and hear the rotten dialogue exchanges heston [to female ape] may kiss you before go ape but you re so ugly he convert to creationism on the spot luckily for us science fiction movies have evolved over time to the point at which some of them are actually good
new address same old attitude don forget to recommend film read the journal or send me some of that nasty hate mail starring bruce willis billy bob thornton liv tyler ben affleck written by jonathan hensleigh and abrams directed by michael bay it rocks actually lots of rocks fly at us or from us in slow or fast motion at several points in the film they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward and when they land once in while when we need break from the space sequences they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like nary mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon steroid user answer to deep impact bruce willis stars as harry stamper famed oil driller commissioned by the beyaz house and nasa to stop giant asteroid before it travels beyond zero barrier and destroys our planet why an oil driller they require someone experienced with deep core mining to plant nuclear missile into said asteroid in one unintentionally hilarious sequence nasa asks harry to inspect deep core driller they built based on his own blueprints it is poorly constructed harry criticizes almost every aspect of it we trust nasa to build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids harry assembles the obligatory ragtag bunch of cowboys including blond guy fat guy siyah guy wiseass and the man who is sleeping with his daughter affleck once they reach space we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong perhaps the fact that they sent bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes whether or not they save the day will not reveal nor will you care will say this you know you re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope willis has barely chance to come alive ditto for affleck their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act in last minute and futile attempt to inject warmth into the material steve buscemi character the wiseass is exceptionally problematic rockhound as he called is sarcastic and foolish so they tape him to chair where he spends most of the film so why did they bring him up there to begin with rather why write him into the film give his almost witty one liners to serious willis who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel at least in my world where the sky is mavi liv tyler is pretty and humourless as always suspiciously four of her father band aerosmith songs grace the soundtrack director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick like ketchup eventually drowning the movie on screen the middle hour is non sensical pyrotechnic assault on the average primate brain whenever someone dies in this movie crew member inevitably yells out we lost insert dead person last name here must admit that not once could distinguish dead oil guy cum astronaut from live one and close ups of the corpses faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance as their skin was often covered in fake blood armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla it looks nicer and has fewer plot holes within its equally ludicrous framework it has vivid soundmix but at almost two and half hours could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story the love story has been played up in the ads perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic fever bollocks the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in moon crawler remember little film called jaws in this film three independent minded men suddenly found themselves on fishing boat in pursuit of deadly shark they didn much like each other at first eventually they started to respect one another one of jaws great scenes involved the would be ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories this is the sort of male bonding foreign to bay or his producer jerry bruckheimer who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before action was called male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps cannot relate to bunch of men who don bare their souls who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and kind of chest beating bravery to this will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic nor brave nor smart even this team couldn build birdhouse and if get no respect for disliking movie with all the synthetic feeling of trailer trailer for movie written by team of body builders and greeting card authors ve never been prouder wimp my whole life
the one question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film since june haven been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky shrieking out ha take on me in his yellow miata why would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine honestly was hoping that all the goofball ads were actually front for decently funny movie man was wrong corky romano is one of those throwaway clich ridden tv star to film vehicles built upon the most rickety of plots fortunately for chris kattan precariously positioned career corky does have some good laughs even if most of them are of the lowest brow variety kattan plays the title character the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who has penchant for sunshiny 80s tunes bright ties and banal coffee mug slogans you don have to be crazy to work here but it sure helps when his mob boss dad peter falk is about to be put away on murder charges his bungling lughead brothers peter berg and chris penn rope in innocent siyah sheep corky to infiltrate the fbi as an agent and steal the evidence predictably hijinks ensue if the basic plot sounds bad wait until you get into the inner workings of this clunker the writers will amaze you with the depth of their inanity corky fbi agent identity is named corky pissant that pronounced pees ahn it french he becomes first rate agent by accidentally stumbling mr magoo style onto the proper clues and talking his way in and out of situations which plays like something out of sitcom and not good sitcom mean the romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each other face and in scene taken straight from there something about mary corky gives dachshund mouth to mouth resuscitation but it not complete disaster the manic kattan does occasionally rescue some comic moments including bit featuring cat in fat suit named jesus and another involving schoolchildren german shephard and kilo of cocaine plus berg whose career has obviously gone downhill since the last seduction and chicago hope gives great turn as the illiterate brother paulie and it nice to see that richard roundtree of shaft fame is getting work unfortunately for those out there who can truly appreciate animal or fart jokes corky won have much to offer you so the next time one of those pesky ads appears on your tv asking who is corky you can simply reply who cares

tri star rated language sexual situations violence 87 minutes director and writer darren stein cast rose mcgowan rebecca gayheart judy greer julie benz chad christ ethan erickson carol kane pam grier tatyana ali review by geoff berkshire jawbreaker is the very definition of rip off this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie 1976 heathers 1989 and clueless 1995 and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich along the way writer director darren stein forgets to give the film life of its own the film opens with voice over from geeky fern mayo judy greer about the four most popular girls at reagan high courtney shayne rose mcgowan who can basically be summed up as satan in heels julie freeman rebecca gayheart good girl with the face of supermodel marcie fox julie benz dim witted blonde who demands that people call her foxy and liz purr charlotte roldan an angel in disguise liz is everyone favorite because she both beautiful and kind liz is about to turn 17 and as prank courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney car but when they open it later polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment their lives will never be the same poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat the audience is treated to few too many graphic looks at liz dead body courtney thinking fast decides to pass the death off as rape murder and marcie and reluctant julie assist her things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into vylette hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students up until about this point the film is effective enough however an investigation begins into liz death and the film becomes excessively dull the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch courtney plan to frame sleazy guy marilyn manson in brief cameo is never believable for second meanwhile the audience is stuck watching string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot julie leaves the group and begins lame romance with aspiring actor zack chad christ he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid fern rise to popularity is equally lame we do get the best scene in the film the only one with spark of originality during this section it smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school resident jock stud dane ethan erickson to demonstrate using popsicle exactly what he would like for her to do to him it at least provides us with look at courtney personality but the way the scene finishes doesn make any sense stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting william katt and soles students in carrie are liz distraught parents jeff conaway from grease 1978 is julie creepy single dad and carol kane the frightened babysitter in when stranger calls 1979 camps it up as principal miss sherman at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look the costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color director of photography amy vicent who beautifully lensed eve bayou 1997 does remarkable job here as well shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive performances are mostly sub par with mcgowan providing only few good moments compared with her excellent work in the doom generation 1995 and scream 1996 and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside high school within the last five years with the exception of actress singer tatyana ali who has small role as cheerleader the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like auto stud college stud and high school stud #2 the soundtrack is decent and imperial teen catchy yoo hoo makes bigger impression than any other aspect of the film
with all that education you should know what happiness is starring sylvia chang teresa hu hsu ming li lieh mao hsueh wei directed by edward yang written by yang and wu nien chen cinematography by christopher doyle and chang hui kung every country has eventually its new wave france had its nouvelle vague brazil its cinema novo china its fifth generation and on and on some waves just take longer than others before they wash over us cleansing us with the balm of discovery taiwan new wave came in the 1980s in the work of directors like hou hsiao hsien wan jen and edward yang that day on the beach yang first feature is central it created new language for young taiwanese directors even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here giving taiwan distinctive international presence that day itself is long and frustrating the document of nation attempt to find voice it does not lack ambition it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan in the manner of antonioni elaborating the alienation that the westernized white collar middle class feel as their lives are shaped by old fashioned roles dedicated career men loyal housewives that they find unfulfilling jia li sylvia chang is the focus but the film brings others into its compass her husband her brother friends from her college days as it charts her discontents no one is happy jia li married her husband we lei at young age at the time her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage despite his affection for another woman and so jia li marriage seemed in comparison good one she chose we lei of her own free will they loved each other but it goes wrong that day dutifully presents all the clich we lei becomes absorbed in his career indulges in an affair with co worker jia li feels restless and trapped bound by choice she made while young but which no longer seems wise the film never redeems these clich by conveying the feel of authentic experience the intensity of lived pain and much of it seems trite and belaboured it unfolds awkwardly as series of flashbacks told during luncheon in vienna where jia li meets her brother old flame teresa hu now concert pianist whom she has not seen since college both women seem rather sad and resigned to their sadness their circumstances and those of jia li brother and college friend suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices married the wrong man chosen the wrong career path etc but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate it is not that jia li married the wrong man she didn the problem is that she needed to marry at all and that if she did not marry she would still be just as unhappy for woman in modern taiwan that day tells us the cards are stacked the dice are loaded she can play the game but the house always wins the film sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan seen now it does not seem provocative indeed it hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy it may be ambitious it may be innovative but it is also terribly terribly dull and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others and his use of those methods is fumbling uncertain undisciplined nor does he bring anything new other than the locale to the material there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for in young couple first kiss in the awkward meeting of woman and her husband mistress but they are brief too often yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes grocery shopping flower arranging in which nothing happens little is said no emotion imparted perhaps if the film were content to focus on such reflective inward moments leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings it might have been ambiguous suggestive insinuating but jia li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence they talk about their problems at length in detail redundantly and eliminate all subtleties at two hours and forty five minutes it all seems exorbitantly long indulgently long winded consider the defining moment for jia li the titular day on the beach the thrust of the whole film explains easily enough what we are to think of that moment what it means when she walks away from particular situation even so the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally in case we may have missed the point needless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed and that is the problem throughout the look of the film is as tedious as the drawn out narrative it was the first feature shot by christopher doyle at least it his name in the credits who is now rightly regarded as one of the world leading cinematographers in the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar wai he seems incapable of fashioning boring image you would never know it from watching that day which due either to doyle inexperience or yang humdrum direction is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible in scrutinizing the long decay of marriage that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience but none of the damage none of the heartbreak
the first in very long list of things wrong with still know what you did last summer is the title think about it for second if the last movie was called know what you did last summer wouldn the next movie have to be still know what you did two summers ago if anyone working on this movie had an greater than five would have thought about it logically and said hey wait minute but alas the people behind this film are obviously idiots so won hold them to that what will hold them to is the fact that they have pretty bad movie on their hands even for teenage slasher flick guess one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film emphasis on the kind of it wasn great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good but at least it didn have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it sequel did there are just so many problems with this movie that it hard trying to figure out where to start first of all guess is the setting the movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas other than the fact that the producers wanted seaside setting exactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking radio contest to get julie james jennifer love hewitt one of the only survivors of the first film and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up the movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through in one scene julie is in tanning booth at deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress can get out no matter how hard she tries when julie discovers she going to slowly fry to death she screams for help and her friends come to her rescue now this is all fine and dandy except for one thing instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth why not just turn the freakin thing off in another scene one of the characters after having their significant other all but decapitated by the man in the slicker says to julie just don tell anybody it rained the whole time oh yeah ve just been terrorized by hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered but hey ll crack jokes anyway after all it is in the script the film only saving graces are few well executed suspense sequences and really cool cameo by the re animator himself jeffrey combs he brings some good comic relief and life to an otherwise limp movie way to go jeffrey have hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept it head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson with scream and even it sequel he displayed real talent as screenwriter his ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on all his films make him standout from all the rest of the horror writers and think still know has really suffered by not having him on board the cool atmosphere is still there this time around but just didn like the characters or the writing as much as did in the first one even though the movie doesn have williamson it still has hacky ending trying to do what kevin did with the first two scream by some may consider this spoiler but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes having two killers and this time having one of them being family member to the other think someone in the audience put it best when after the movie had ended with another the killer is back cliffhanger he said who is this time the grandma all in all still know tries to be as successful as the first the film was but really fails in the attempt mean it okay when slasher movies rip off each other but when they start copying themselves
there nothing new under the sun is phrase often used when the speaker actually means let find something to copy of course there are very few completely original ideas even earth shattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience there is after all no need to re invent the wheel time after time recently it seems that hollywood doesn feel the need to even re write the script my understanding of the word sequel is continuation of the story the film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of brian depalma adaptation of the steven king novel this is your dream come true rachel emily bergl high school outcast is beginning to notice weird things happening around her doors slam shut by themselves glass globes blow up her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent popular boy unexpectedly asks her out the in crowd conspires to embarrass her at public event any of this sound familiar once the audience catches on that this is the same story as carrie there little to do but wait for the inevitable ending the effects are bit better this time around but the film doesn work nearly as well there are couple of minor plot differences rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest and uh there must be other story changes but none stand out one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie now high school counselor she befriends rachel but her character potential is squandered there too much about sue that doesn make sense after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachel mother is in still living in the same small town the woman with well known history of mental problems is hired as high school counselor sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is genetic disease this may be the one original idea in the film but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as disease is never explained sue eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldn figure out what to do with her blink and you ll miss it some of the events are filmed in siyah and beyaz but the rationale for this is unknown it doesn add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random the rage retains some of the trappings of carrie without the meaning in the first film the color kirmizi was motif connected to carrie onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating here there an abundance of kirmizi but for no apparent purpose the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin one might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds the biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film and the flaws in this one

the scene at the end of 1989 `dead poets society when robin williams english students stand up on their desk and say `captain my captain gets me every time unfortunately the court room scene near the end of robin newest film `patch adams doesn have anywhere near the same impact from the surface `patch adams looks very promising it story about not so young man patch adams robin williams who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people when the film opens we find patch depressed and suicidal checking himself into mental hospital in few scenes strongly reminiscent of `one flew over the cuckoo nest he ends up helping the patients through their problems and it here that he finds how much he loves working with people so he checks himself out of the hospital and heads straight to medical school right from the start patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable he continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry shortly after joining medical school he meets and falls in love with carin monica potter they along with patch dork friend truman daniel london start medical clinic for uninsured people once the dean catches wind of the clinic he tells patch he can graduate and kicks him out of school patch like what any true american would do takes the school to court it here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place over whether or not patch can become real doctor have never seen movie with some potential just completely blow it it seems more like series of short sketches rather than full length movie considering it runs almost two hours much too long for such light film it could have flowed much smoother not to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama robin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels but those moments are rare and in the end `patch adams is barely average
the real blonde woman face an arm some pumped up pectorals blond hair man sad face slender legs random hand here and there as the opening credits of tom dicillo the real blonde unfold these scattered fractured glimpses eventually come together to form the image of bikini brief clad man on his knees clinging to nurturing woman his head concealing her unclothed breasts if only the rest of this formless aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently joe matthew modine is waiter struggling actor too proud to take gigs in commercials or soap operas he feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his live in love mary catherine keener who holds some subconscious hostility toward the male gender mary makeup artist regularly works on model sahara bridgette wilson who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disney the little mermaid the bottle blonde has turbulent on again off again relationship with bob maxwell caulfield soap actor who yearns for the taste of real blonde which he finds in co star kelly daryl hannah as the film unspools variety of other characters pass through fashion photographer blair marlo thomas mary shrink buck henry and self defense instructor denis leary joe casting agent kathleen turner and hardass boss christopher lloyd and mystery woman elizabeth berkley who keeps on crossing joe path where exactly does all this go that question best posed to writer director dicillo who doesn appear to have the slightest clue himself his meandering largely unfunny script and direction are like hopelessly lost drivers turning into dead end narrative streets only to reverse course and hit another creative cul de sac and another and another at one point bob frustrated with the soap scripts complains to the head writer jim fyfe that his and kelly characters keep on going in circles with no hint of development or growth that is most certainly the case here joe gets job and ultimately botches things he and mary bicker they make up only to have the pattern repeat itself unhappy with his bottle blonde bob gets his real blonde but is unsatisfied he returns to the faux and is still unsatisfied if there is point to all of this dicillo dances around it spending his time on apparent digressions that as it turns out aren digressions at all the real blonde is not without some amusements it does have the occasional funny line and situation leary henry lloyd steve buscemi and dave chappelle shine in their small roles keener is likable refreshingly earthy lead berkley appearance is mercifully brief she receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for ten minute role and there is the irony of having caulfield play wildly popular soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket last year the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after scant six months due to lack of viewer interest but on the whole the real blonde is frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its title it may be glossy on the surface but there nothing going on inside opens february 27
jack frost is one of those dumb corny concoctions that attempts to be heartwarming family film but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching this does not come as surprise since the studio that made it is warner brothers who is on current streak of one bad film after the other jack frost michael keaton is struggling middle aged rock musician who loves his wife gabby kelly preston and 11 year old son charlie joseph cross but doesn spend nearly enough time with them when he receives call from music label that wants to hear him play he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas halfway there jack has second thoughts but on his way back home is in car accident and dies switch forward year christmas is approaching once again and charlie and gabby are still having difficult time coming to terms with jack death when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died the snowman outside the house is taken over by jack spirit jack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise frosty the snowman is classic cartoon and the idea of snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated but as live action film it doesn work at all after somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established jack frost quickly goes downhill especially once the snowman comes into play since jack has been deceased for whole year you would think there would be many questions to ask him such as what happens after you die or how does it feel to be snowman but instead the film focuses on snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before even sat down to watch the movie the performances are respectable enough but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in silly film like this michael keaton at least got off easy since he disappears after the first twenty minutes but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here have always liked kelly preston she is clearly talented charismatic actress but has never been given good role in her life usually having to settle for one dimensional supporting character as in 1997 nothing to lose and addicted to love joseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast since he believably portrayed boy suffering the loss of parent in one of the only subplots that actually works due to its wittiness henry rollins is highly amusing as hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman this brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side however by the tried and true main plot at hand which is the sappy story of father and son since knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid cringe inducing lines of dialogue some of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father you da man says charlie no da snowman replies jack or how about this little zinger coming from school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out snowdad is better than no dad do people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this the snowman created by john henson creature shop is more believable than the snowman from last year unintentionally hilarious direct to video horror flick also called jack frost but it still was difficult to tell if it was person in suit or computer effects either way it was an awful lot of work to go through just to come up with final product as featherbrained as this project as seasonal holiday picture jack frost is pretty much clunker better christmas film from this year is ll be home for christmas better yet my suggestion would be to stay home and watch quality film such as it wonderful life christmas story or prancer jack frost is an earnest but severely misguided film and children as well as adults deserve better doubt they would want to see movie about the death of parent anyway
some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone in the movie has turned off their brains the real mccoy is both it charmless molasses slow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta where the real mccoy is set might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy kim basinger being arrested in the middle of job six years later karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight she soon bumps into barker val kilmer hapless would be thief who idolizes karen also has ties to jack schmidt terence stamp the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him schmidt who is in cahoots with karen sleazy parole officer gailard sartain again wants karen to help him stage robbery this time he has some leverage karen kidnapped son just when she thought she was out they keep pulling her back in contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them leading the list is the jack schmidt character who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime let alone why he would actually participate in the break in karen initial encounter with during botched convenience store hold up also strains the limits of credibility it would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point but instead they run into each other the next day because they re leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment small world eh then there the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape and pet tigers which through the power of the laws of bad cinema must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage however the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police who come off like the keystone kops on bad day but the fun doesn end there in the shambles of script by william davies and william osborne there is also the absence of single solitary interesting character karen is earnest and single minded in her motherly devotion but lacking any kind of edge which would make her convincing criminal and basinger is not thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material schmidt is flaccid villain the parole officer is complete blank and karen son and ex husband might as well be furniture only kilmer is remotely appealing but his one potentially intriguing quality his ineptitude is never developed in fact kilmer disappears during the middle of the film just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting sub plot might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to caper comedy but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast various scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever and some end with no reason evident why they didn end up on the cutting room floor even the reasonably clever climactic break in falls victim to this syndrome including scene of one of the thieves drilling open vault which lasts kid you not four minutes there is no tension in the scene just tedium russell mulcahy highlander is director with some style and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good but he completely stumbles in the editing room there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that tempted to overlook the little ones like karen disarming one of schmidt henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of park where her son is playing like fountain crushed when van runs into it reappearing in one piece few moments later tempted but pretty good at resisting temptation
you think that these people only exist in the movies but trust me they re as real as life once talked to guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person brain with microwaves then sat in room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections even listened to man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted these people had what are known as conspiracy theories ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public little imagination goes long way in richard donner conspiracy theory jerry fletcher mel gibson is new york city cab driver who seems to have conspiracy theory about everything his latest that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle might sound outrageous to us but is all in day work for him he combs the newspaper looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings on behind the scenes and from there jerry draws his conclusions upstanding citizen that he is he tries to convince alice sutton julia roberts of the justice department that the president must be warned lucky gal alice who met jerry when he saved her from couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since what she doesn know is that jerry interest in her is far more than well professional he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry ideas and his limited circulation conspiracy theory newsletter he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice help one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action thriller when it seems to have neither whole lot of action nor significant number of thrills part of this is result of the film slow pace it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice and even once that is over with the rest of the film seems to be lot of boredom that every once in while stops to take break for excitement at over two hours this film could have been significantly condensed and had it running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour but even then the action scenes would not be able to save the film instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces we re treated to few of the generic scenes with the requisite siyah elements siyah helicopter men in siyah action suits and body armor siyah vehicles you know the drill they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons but for some reason guy with just bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time big deal we ve seen it all before watching the film wished donner had at least tried to use little imagination but was out of luck now when say it took forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice completely mean what one person is relative to the other and not romantic involvement oh donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring you see there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies also directed by donner than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory the two just don click and when you throw in number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether like finding out he been stalking her the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced the script in general also seems forced like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it then took it and forced it upon us dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable to the point that almost stopped listening even gibson usual gift for ad lib couldn punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest although one of jerry theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing unfortunately much of what discussed in the film is not inherently important to what going on but instead filler that starts out with potential but ends up just being extraneous because it never followed through for example jerry professes that man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in new york subway station he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to water main break hence the water in subway station and that the coroner should check the man lungs for chlorine this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him you know what happens then nothing zip nada no follow up whatsoever so what the significance okay here another one couple of well known real life assassins were found to have possessed copies of the salinger novel the catcher in the rye jerry also has bunch of copies whenever he goes into bookstore he has to buy one leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin we re never given reason to believe why this would make him an assassin not when we find out about his salinger collection not when he goes to the bookstore not later on when we get the answer to our first question the point becomes totally extraneous oh did mention that patrick stewart is in this film yeah he plays this government psychiatrist named dr jonas who may or may not be bad guy that about it for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has he nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory you can just lump him in with the supporting players with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi this guy was really likable and wish he and his character had gotten more screen time okay here my theory this really started out as great film but some of its jokes were actually true the government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security and this was what was left over
it seemed like the perfect concept what better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter than to make movie about guy with split personality it exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care to the wind to get laugh jim carrey signed on too even better the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly as schizophrenia and so forth such protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers fire proving that some people just couldn take joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy yes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie isn funny it not for lack of trying the farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most high concept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites man who after being dumped by his wife for midget limo driver decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them this of course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too forgiving nature making his job as rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult soon enough charlie repressed aggression manifests itself into second independent personality named hank deep voiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster this guy isn above crashing car through the wall of the barber shop in which he been insulted or holding little girl head underwater because she refused to stop jump roping in the street then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film runs off its tracks some have suggested that this isn problem because the farrelly brothers brand of humor doesn require plot to work they re wrong of course plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort 1996 there something about mary 1999 outside providence was technically an earlier project the brothers earlier film wasn funny merely because it contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected in mary the farrellys managed several times to pull off neat sleight of hand trick they have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion me myself irene by contrast seems to have been made by folks who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work having been produced by the same guys who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment the brothers pile on the offensive humor taking shots at race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner of bathroom jokes but they haven come up with way to make any of it fresh most of me myself irene comes off as rote by the numbers adolescent comedy the plot with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene waters renee zellweger who in more trouble than anyone knows back to new york has an ending that entirely predictable from the get go think charlie and irene will fall in love yeah me too the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven already expected them to do no matter how outrageous their actions might be compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing this stuff is almost entirely soft tossed presenting an obvious problem when gross out humor loses its shock value it no longer funny merely gross the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry take for example the subplot involving charlie three siyah sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon the incongruity of it all is funny for while with three burly siyah men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too pleasant smile on his face but by the end of the film they re still doing the same schitck it hasn been elevated to another funnier level and it hasn been dropped either that too bad because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through me myself irene reeks of wasted opportunities there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie new personality and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank actions this doesn really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie condition early on so they don have any opportunity to be surprised by it the film throws what looks like patented farrelly curve in scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script doesn go anywhere with it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax jim carrey is gifted comedian both physically and vocally but he left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in manner similar to steve martin in all of me it great showcase of flexibility and split second role shifting but none of it is terribly funny carrey doesn pull any stunts we don expect him to pull and the farrellys script doesn give him anything else to pull the situations in which he must perform the role shifting aren set up in any meaningful way perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better zellweger irene is not strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strong willed irene is nothing in particular as the film never makes clear whether she ditzy clever or neither as such she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only sane person in the film chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straight laced for movie like this he like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected after viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked but don believe it good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style if the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and still think they are they ll rebound just fine even after that happens though ll still consider me myself irene to be high caliber misfire
wesley snipes is master of selecting bad action roles murder at 1600 marshals money train drop zone boiling point and the ultimate camp film passenger 57 the art of war is another entry in this very ugly and unique category ultimately it is little more than ridiculous action film with plot as believable as the warren report ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe and terrible acting by list actors like michael biehn and anne archer oddly it feels like the undiscovered sequel to another snipes masterpiece rising sun the movie revolves around the convenient story of special un operative caught up in secret murder conspiracy involving chinese ambassador the chinese triad brotherhood rich chinese businessman played by that bad guy from rising sun cary hiroyuki tagawa chinese un interpreter and inexplicably donald sutherland the film ends with more confusion than boatload of chinese immigrants trying to register at ellis island or should say the film ends with the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix and all of john woo hong kong films combined am really at loss to figure out why wesley snipes had the gumption to not only star in this action dud but also act as one of the producers of the film usually enjoy snipes movies though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his action films simply am amazed by the how inane the script was filled with terrible cliches and extremely violent action sequences director christian duguay screamers has strange attraction to the viciousness of violent acts showing splattering brains people impaled with broken shards of glass and lots of gargling and gagging as blood sprays everywhere it also sickens me to know that oliver stone one of the greatest directors working today had his hand in producing this monstrosity guess snipes sold stone on the conspiracy angle and stone chose not to read the script watch the dailies be involved in casting or anything else or else he be filing court order to remove his name from the credits it also seems evident that with the russkies as our new bosom buddies and the middle eastern terrorist angle being beaten to death in the last couple of years that the new international enemies in hollywood are the communist chinese sure over the next couple of months even more chinese conspiracy martial arts action flicks are going to be popping up in your local multiplex hopefully they won include wesley snipes
senseless is prime example of what can happen when you try to push one joke concept bit too far director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon college senior vying for lucrative job at prominent brokerage however he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition scott thorpe david spade in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep an athletic record sponsorship by fraternity and most of all wealthy family to back him up in fact darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet but there may be light at the end of that tunnel he signs up as human guinea pig in neurological experiment run by the university dr wheedon brad dourif as result his senses are magnified tenfold using his newfound abilities he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side effects to having super senses naturally marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle giving jim carrey ish amounts of physical humor the problem is aside from few genuinely inspired bits there not much that funny here the film has it one central gag and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor there obviously wasn much thought put into the plot the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous mean why the emphasis on extra curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to single elimination quiz anyhow and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester to give it credit senseless does try to create secondary joke with darryl roommate tim laflour matthew lillard apparently he is supposed to be faddish but the film never does anything with him leaving him in piercing phase throughout the movie his intervention scenes with darryl however do provide rare and welcome laugh and then there the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one in this case the object of darryl amor is janice tamara taylor fellow student who won have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super senses needless to say the romance is completely extraneous and adds little to the film this is film that desperately needed something else be that good plot more jokes or simply funnier ones or strong character or two anything would have helped senseless get off the ground as it is all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can help marlon wayans get this one off the ground
came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor an innocuous enough on the surface romantic comedy it not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity but there it was nonetheless sat there watching this marshmallow of movie unfold when suddenly realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 in word it the same thing that wrong with so many movies circa 1999 writing more to the point it the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you re telling story about relationship the bachelor is merely the latest in long line of films where we re expected to get dewy eyed over any pairing of attractive pleasant people just because they re attractive and pleasant in this particular case attractive and pleasant exhibit is jimmy shannon chris donnell single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage it scary notion for jimmy even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit anne renee zellweger his girlfriend of three years convinced despite his reservations that it time to sh or get off the pot jimmy proposes to anne very badly anne refuses which leaves jimmy in very odd position when his eccentric grandfather peter ustinov dies and leaves very specific video will jimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is married by 05 on his 30th birthday stays married for 10 years and produces child there are only couple of minor problems jimmy 30th birthday is the next day anne is nowhere to be found meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex girlfriends it wacky brewster millions esque premise acknowledged as such in one of the film better more self aware lines of dialogue the kind where shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters at least that would be the case if jimmy weren already world class altruist screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will if jimmy doesn get married not only will he lose all the money but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him costing hudreds of jobs from the outset jimmy motivation isn cash it the livelihoods of his devoted employees it almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play role in the bachelor plot development by any human standard the guy is impossibly selfless and that the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness there never any tension between the two star crossed lovers because there no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake the blandly nice donnell couldn pull off randy cad if he tried so the filmmakers don even let him zellweger anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to but no one dares make her anything but the woman lightly wronged and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation the parade of sit com set pieces had better be damned funny since they re all that stands between us and blissfully sweet foregone conclusion ll admit couple of those set pieces are amusing including ustinov rantings about procreation and restaurant full to bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly like the shudder inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in church you re never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from film like the bachelor but that not the real problem nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm fuzzy conclusion it leading up to the problem are beginning and middle that are equally warm fuzzy there no spark no energy no humanity it an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer digestions we ve reached point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don even have pulse the bachelor is love among the mannequins
are you like me do you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places shouting out loud not giving ratt ass about anyone around them and basically just wallowing in their own self importance well if you are than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and half only to make up and hug in the end aaaaaaaahhhh plot three grown up sisters living their own separate lives begin to re establish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill critique this would be good movie if it wasn for the fact that it got very little to say features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations is chockfull of bad acting moments and provides less emotional satisfaction than any third rate after school special and being nice how junk like this gets made is beyond me but happy am that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt professional blow considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryan character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at christmas tree lot wow how deep of course the same christmas tune that played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background while characters continue to build bonds among one another by making reference to old quaint movies or movie stars stop me gonna cry again this film is mess the characters are boring and irritating to watch the plot has something to do with three selfish sisters talking on the phone whole lot kind of liking their father but not really and then finally realizing the error of their ways while sharing an emotional moment about movie stars from the 50s admittedly was not expecting much from film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds and big dog rolling its eyes but even was surprised at the level of ineptitude when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth in this film meg did fine as the sister who cries lot looking as adorable as ever but someone please put lisa kudrow inside permanent home of limited range cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movie tv show that she in enough already and diane keaton must ve spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one cause her acting was amateurish at best neither one convinced in emotional scenes granted they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film and that probably where my rating of three points comes from all in all this movie is not funny unless you re one to chuckle at train wrecks provides zero drama unless you consider loud phone conversations moving generates absolutely no emotion although did tear up when meg hugged coffee machine and ends on perfectly pretentious note oh no please don get any flour on my donna karan dress ugh suggest that all ladies take their husbands boyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something that ll teach em to mess with you oh and incidentally mrs joblo also likened this movie to piece of cow dung flailing in the wind so there then again maybe you ll like it
have confession even though am movie junkie saw eye of the beholder and yet still watch movies ve never seen any of the original godzillas note that godzilla 2000 is not sequel to the godzilla released in 1998 it the american release of 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni sen mireniamu so part of me was excited as drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000 the latest entry in an almost 50 year old franchise this was long awaited treat was expecting goofy good time complete with bad dubbing science fair level sets and ludicrous plot line the last thing expected was for the movie to be so boring can only imagine what the theatre full of kids saw this with felt you do get all of the so bad they re good traits so normally associated with the franchise but you have to sit through snoozer plot that has the organization of rorschach blot it deal wasn willing to accept hiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimura script crams in way too many details and in many cases fails to follow up on them the maneuver is not only disconcerting but gives the movie permanent logy weighty feel godzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops was it whim bold political statement don know its foe an ancient meteor that looks like prudential logo doesn just fight the beast from the far east no it got to have life saving powers plot to erase the data from japan desire to clone and the ability to become spaceship and then some kind of tentacled space creature there battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit takehiro murata and slimy government official hiroshi abe over the handling of godzilla and personal issues and then there the plucky news photographer and blah blah blah it like watching magnolia all over again except without the good writing keen sociological insight and aimee mann songs what waste when the talking and the plot points stop hurtling at you godzilla 2000 does the job it entertaining and goes down easy the action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though little sluggish the dubbing is nice and awful with murata sounding like he in constant need of cough drop as for the dialogue one line summarizes the goofiness factor did anyone see that flying rock go by this movie also marked the first time since the three stooges that ve heard the word imbecile used in casual conversation though the summer movie season is drying up and godzilla 2000 has its moments wouldn take kids to see it they ll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose
capsule five friends at stag party are involved in the accidental killing of prostitute the cover up attempt becomes monster that eats up the friends two wives and several innocent bystanders this was real audience pleaser at toronto but it did not do much for me low to +4 directed by peter berg who acted in the last seduction and copland five buddies go on stag outing to las vegas while cameron diaz works through the logistics of her upcoming wedding to one of them one of the buddies accidentally kills prostitute several people with no moral compass they started out with simple innocent little cocaine party and by accident look what happened they have one moral person among them daniel stern and one totally amoral person christian slater it is more selfish to let the amoral lead so they do this film is strange but not really funny or biting black comedy should actually be funny as well as strange there should be some element of satire the satire is missing here did not find myself laughing here either what we have is strange crime tale one just does not care what happens to these people the same idea of people just getting themselves in deeper and deeper has been done frequently if this film is popular it is just bringing familiar plot to new generation it begins like diner particularly with daniel stern and ends up like an extended horror crime comic book there are several logical holes in script if security man goes to investigate complaint and disappears wouldn the guests he was investigating be the first suspects someone framed for crime in the way shown would be judged innocent after minimal forensic detective work am desperately trying to avoid making this spoiler popular and situation ethics get real slamming some acting of grief is hammy and overdone more yelling than humor
warner brothers has scored another marketing coup the one two punch was started in the summer with the release of batman forever trailers for ace ventura were bundled with the bat ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel carrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the ever wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video $11 99 at wal mart mere two weeks before carrey return in this marketwise but misfired comedy ace ventura when nature calls is painful reminder of just how grating the rubber faced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment he may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher in batman forever but here left to his own devices carrey quickly wears out his welcome the opening sequence is by far the best an amusing spoof of cliffhanger with ace performing mountain rescue of stranded raccoon you can guess what happens to mr paws hint it sounds like splat the plot quickly shifts to temple in the himalayas and then to not so darkest africa where ace is on the case of missing beyaz bat with his hair and limbs both wildly askew carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes the rest of the film is just more of the same sure the plot linear and the production values solid but where is the scripted humor to support carrey sloppy slathering writer and director steve oderkerk provides precious few set ups instead carrey just mugs away playing for the camera even when most of it isn funny the better gags have been shown in the ads though bit with ace emerging buck naked from the backside of mechanical rhino is something to see though an arguable improvement over the original ace ventura when nature calls is still snooze for anyone over the age of ten the script is virtually devoid of wit tribal mask jokes jerry lewis cameos forget it if anything the inexplicable presence of simon callow four weddings and funeral and bob gunton the shawshank redemption suggests that working with carrey is the classical actor ultimate challenge just how long can they keep straight face
synopsis wealthy cuban landowner luis banderas gets more than he bargained for when he sends away for an american bride not only does his new wife turn out to be the beautiful julia jolie she also harbours secret past of dubious merit soon julia has absconded with both luis fortune and his heart and as he pursues his wife through the cuban underworld luis begins to realise that for him there is no turning back review given the absurdism of its would be plot it unlikely that original sin could have been turned into reputable piece of filmmaking regardless of writer director or stars this is at its heart movie junk lurid melodrama which appeals to neither the brain nor the heart but to the nether regions that said original sin could at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness and indulged in it instead cristofer seems to have mistaken this for serious production and directs it as such the result is vapid uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses as likely to incite yawn as thrill consider the initial sex scene between banderas and jolie brightly lit and mostly filmed from above it looks like an excerpt from an amateur soft porn show cristofer doesn even manage to capture the allure of cuba instead of portraying his setting as steamy sensuous island paradise it appears bland and lifeless at least banderas and jolie manage to inspire some interest there are hints at times that they want to have more fun with the script but aren being given the chance the same cannot be said of jane whose billy is nebbish and transparent also unwise is the jolie framing sequence which practically gives away the film denouement
the kirmizi violin is cold sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached it movie that seems almost clinical as it traces the 300 plus years history of the legendary musical instrument of the title opening in the 17th century the story shows how violin maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as gift for his unborn son but when tragedy strikes the violin becomes the personification of its maker grief from there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery again tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds home in england and in mao communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz samuel jackson who mounts painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity the violin becomes morritz obsession just as it is for all those who converge on montreal auction house to bid on it morritz however is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creator intention the kirmizi violin could have been touching inspirational story as soaring as beethoven symphony however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer here is story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact girard for some unknown reason uses mostly master shots keeping his camera and thus us at distance we get no feel for the miracle that is the violin it resonance its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression nor are any of the performances memorable it as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin the kirmizi violin promises much but delivers little it is dull at times bit pretentious and might murky the movie music soars over its story and performers and that is its only saving grace
there have been merchant ivory costume dramas with more of pulse than the mod squad self consciously hip cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many baby boomers well said squad certainly won be pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards contemporary take on this decidedly 70s show doesn exactly seem unwarranted but one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf didn transform into full blown case of botulism how curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad insisting that the latter is group of people working together and then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for sizeable chunk of the running time they are julie pete and linc reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd exposition put out of the way so fast that you re likely to be lost from the opening moments on and they are respectively played by claire danes giovanni ribisi and omar epps talented actors each deserving of better than this their plight involves standard cop corruption stuff as our would be protagonists catch wind of an internal cover up after their superior reliable dennis farina one of the best things here and gone so quickly gets killed and framed for drug trafficking they pout lot and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that would impress the hardy boys and linda tripp but few others when you re supposed to be asking what going to happen next you ll instead entertain thoughts like who are these people and why should care or aren thrillers supposed to contain thrills not that danes epps and ribisi don give it shot danes can do the troubled teen thing in her sleep as evidenced by my so called life but she saddled with mysterious boyfriend josh brolin subplot so see through you begin to seriously question her so called intelligence ditto for ribisi saving private ryan looney loose cannon though at least he performs with wild and crazy vigor that occasionally demands attention but epps poor epps epps higher learning is so short changed he reduced to literally waiting around for bad guy to chase him all this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters one of whom scott silver is also the director they must think that if they dress up their stupid story in such spiffy trappings the look of the film is really quite impressive it ll somehow pay off but this mod squad plods anyway characters are non existent present are just some good looking young things modeling cool levis and cooler attitudes plot hardly escapes confusing convention and the one genre element you think would be show up in generous portions few nifty explosions some fights any kind of action whatsoever only rarely makes it to this dull gabfest all those quick to put down last month inept but serviceable my favorite martian update need to take step back here small to big screen translation that really should ve stayed in its former incarnation mod or not
ready to rumble is not masterpiece in film have problem even regarding it as film it more of show big commercial for ted turner world championship wrestling wcw the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page goldberg and sting the story is very minimal and basic there are these two guys gordy david arquette and sean scott caan they are two twenty something wrestling fans from wyoming when they go to live event for the big match up there favorite wrestler jimmy king oliver platt is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus joe pantoliano gordy and sean decide to go on quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus plans on the way they meet some people have some fun and clean up some port potties sounds great huh well it not the movie makes many attempts at humor only few of them work the jokes that make you laugh however do not outnumber the film many duds there is funny repertoire between arquette and convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back especially enjoyed one version in which they have wrestling match and arquette tag team partner is macho man randy savage they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl the cheerleaders of the wcw she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face now what didn work in this movie that would be the rest of it the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets the two lead characters work for port potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck the excrements spill all over the road it not funny it pathetic and brainless the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way watch it for entertainment and would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle like that would happen to any fan especially to that stalk wrestler and sneak him back onto set also wondered how they got into the backstage so easily they just walked right in like wrestling watch it at home and laugh it continuously funny and has great characters otherwise wouldn watch it this movie wasn even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv the only fun had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers knew the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently the movie was too dim witted to be funny it is possibly the most useless and under developed film ever recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film detroit rock city that movie was interesting well done and continuously funny unlike this film the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh now that the scream trilogy is over arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be spokesman in those dumb 800 call att ads at least he has hot wife in courtney cox he in the funny parts of the film but there aren enough to make him look good the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock bawitdaba and cowboy martin landau has great cameo as classic hard nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne script is important to film but this piece of crap could have been made with couple of scribblings on napkin fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real the wrestlers form alliances go to people houses and beat them up it utterly ridiculous the whole film was wasteful dumfounding experience the movie was made to pay homage to the fans telling them things that made wrestling not the wrestlers the wrestlers are making more money to make movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying dollars to see potty humor movie the wcw sucks and this movie is just pathetic two hour commercial to watch it if you re going to watch wrestling watch wwf it actually entertaining the wrestling is betters they re funnier more diverse and have better entrance themes oh and the girls are hotter is this what movies have become hour long commercials that you have to pay to see don waste your money

david schwimmer from the television series friends stars as sensitive and slightly neurotic single guy who gets more than he expected from the grieving mother barbara hershey of classmate he can remember hello mrs robinson though quite cute as romantic comedy the pallbearer is paced like funeral march the characters act react and interact at half speed making for one excruciatingly long sit and what with the dreary lighting co writer director matt reeves brings some snap to the story midsection the film briefly comes to life when our hero attempts to resolve his feelings for another classmate very appealing gwyneth paltrow by this time though most viewers will have either fled or fallen asleep those tough souls who stay with it can marvel at the sleepy eyed schwimmer hound dog with head cold who can go for over an hour without ever changing his expression
saving silverman is good example of good comedy gone bad as love story it is good however as comedy it falls flat on it face think throughout the short 90 minutes laughed total of seven times and those were just chuckles at the most the movie doesn have the oomph to make it great movie and doesn have the script to make it funny movie wayne lefessier steven zahn mcnugent jack siyah and darren silverman jason biggs have grown up all their lives together they have been best friends forever and vow to stay close till the end while in bar after doing show with their band based on their love of neil diamond darren meets young woman named judith amanda peet whom he instantly falls for wayne and however think differently and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again it up to wayne and to try and begin saving silverman the performances are topnotch and surprisingly they are what keep the movie afloat jason biggs right off the flop loser does an ok job playing silverman but he is stale and flat at times steve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier and even though the movie is about silverman lefessier is really the main character and the narrator of the movie itself jack siyah is well jack siyah and he does an all right job as but he isn as funny as he has been in the past amanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith and neil diamond plays neil diamond he better at singing than acting anyway the performances in the film are good but it too bad the script isn speaking of script hank nelkan choppy script is not only badly written but not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street the trailer for the movie as with most movies gives away everything that happens in the movie especially the funniest parts somewhere saving silverman was meant to be good movie and it could have been but alas in the end it wasn dennis dugan direction is all right he adds few directorial touches here and there nothing special being simple comedy saving silverman is perfectly bad movie in more ways than one it has great cast good director and sweet story it just too bad it has bad script and is all together bad movie
one of my brother favorite movies is halicki 1974 cult flick gone is sixty seconds one of the best products of the car chase genre that provided drive in fare during the 1970 chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue but they had strong visceral appeal although it boasts bigger budget and familiar stars the remake of gone in sixty seconds is relatively weak and dull randall memphis raines nicolas cage is retired car thief who runs go cart track he got out of crime so that his younger brother kip giovanni ribisi would not take up boosting cars however kip became thief anyway and now he in big trouble kip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri christopher eccleston by the end of the week calitri expects memphis to fulfill kip bargain if he doesn come through kip dies memphis gathers his old crew angelina jolie robert duvall will patton chi mcbride and vinnie jones and kip brings his boys cross william lee scott scott caan and james duval as if calitri breathing down their necks wasn bad enough the team is pursued by cop delroy lindo who still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by rival gangster rap star master who wants to take over calitri clients watching gone discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one maybe that why the first forty nine are fairly easy and the thrills are saved for eleanor 1967 shelby gto model that has always eluded memphis but the big chase doesn live up to the long wait had high hopes for gone because it is director dominic sena second film kalifornia his 1993 debut was brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience in that movie sena took simple thriller plot couple gives serial killer ride and successfully endowed it with deeper significance in gone he seems to be aiming for drama about two brothers who can communicate with each other but that goal just doesn mesh with this plot gone either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough it not light enough to be fun or mean enough to be intense this chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it the lack of action is waste of the premise which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever the weak script is waste of talented cast in newsweek interview last year sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies much as like cage for every good picture he does leaving las vegas bringing out the dead there are two major stinkers snake eyes con air 8mm city of angels that ratio is probably better than what lot of his peers can boast but cage has real talent it shame to waste it in glitzy superficial tripe like gone in 60 seconds
steve martin is one of the funniest men alive if you can take that as true statement then your disappointment at this film will equal mine martin can be hilarious creating some of the best laugh out loud experiences that have ever taken place in movie theaters you won find any of them here the old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and wit bilko and the name isn an accident is the head of an army motor pool group but his passion is his schemes every episode involves the sergeant and his men in one or another hair brained plan to get rich quick while outwitting the officers of the base mchale navy granddaddy that the idea behind this movie too but the difference is that as far fetched and usually goofy as the television series was it was funny there is not one laugh in the film the re make retains the goofiness but not the entertainment everything is just too clean it was obviously made on hollywood back lot and looks every bit like it it all looks brand new even the old beat up stuff martin is remarkably small in what should have been bigger than life role in the original phil silvers played the huckster with heart of altin and more than touch of sleaziness martin bilko is pale imitation the only semi bright spot is phil hartman as bilko arch enemy it not saying much considering martin lackluster character but hartman leaves him in the dust
have you ever been in an automobile accident where you ve miraculously walked away with only few scratches yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable mangled wreck well that has never actually happened to me and hope that none of us will ever experience this situation but after watching this inane exercise of movie certainly feel that ve miraculously walked away unscathed after two hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond oddly `eye of the beholder which is psychological romance thriller starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to british intelligence agent called the eye ewan mcgregor working in washington dc in the humorous opening scene he eyes top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down using an array of high tech surveillance and communications equipment he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office the law firm employees get good chuckle the audience gets good chuckle the eye is later given an assignment where he encounters beautiful woman ashley judd there is something compelling about this mysterious woman despite her glamorous looks however we learn that she is psychopath with propensity to kill men that get too close to her after the murders she sobs while singing the christmas tune `little bluebirds and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago after each killing she puts on different wig assumes new name and then makes her way to another state the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions but he does not alert the authorities he somehow empathizes with her sense of loss the eye it turns out also is haunted by his past his daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life his tormented psyche creates ghost like image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation she becomes sort of spectral adviser and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman he now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation it doesn matter that he has witnessed all of her murders and it doesn matter that the eye is abnormally reticent hiding his entire life behind computer screens he follows her to dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble when crazed druggie jason priestley attacks her he shows up for some quick butt kicking when the police are closing in to arrest her he provides distraction so that she can escape all the while the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight peculiar how bad is this movie refer you to my `review quote source litmus test just take look at the full page ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes for this movie they are from magazines called `flaunt and `mirabella no doubt they were impressed with judd series of catwalks and disguise changes the major problem with `eye of the beholder is that the film jerks forward always unsure of its ultimate destination if it was thriller there was little to keep us entranced if it was love story there was absolutely no emotional pull completely disjointed in structure it only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial the one where the `6 on the tachometer dissolves into winding road and passenger rail car dissolves into small miniature on child train set am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find serious role to showcase her potential talents beyond that the film is hopelessly out of control and is in need of seriously better traction and handling
bad bad bad that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls if that summary isn enough for you how about t&a t&a t&a still haven got the point other than director russ meyer predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore mentioned anatomical areas there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking look at this movie that is the fact that it was co written by famed film critic roger ebert who also was responsible for the screenplay after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives movie thumbs down for bad writing with straight face this movie stinks out loud quite frankly this movie deserves but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny so giving it and maybe that is too generous right from the opening credits knew that had class bomb on my hands not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting but the first scene you see includes big breasted young woman being chased by guy in nazi uniform had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening it does get explained later and as soon as the first scene is over we cut to completely unrelated scene to be honest as sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film it wouldn have surprised me if the opening had never been explained so what is this movie about you ask like it really matters ok here goes this all girl band headed by kelly macnamara dolly reed and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain foothold in the music industry once there they do manage to find success due as much to their hooters as anything else it sure wasn for their brutally bad singing voices and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them everything from big egos to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on downward spiral there are couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing >from creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here other than the above mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts mr ebert has generously thrown in helpings of hey man dig and my all time favorite this is my happening and it freaks me out now ask you with lines like that how can you go wrong ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter don know but all the big words in the world wouldn be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie ve seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey in fact there is one scene the one in which they are in van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes during which really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries add to the directing and writing the music in this movie almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken there was such pile of crap emanating from the speakers then we have the cast first lets start david gurian who played harris the manager of the band this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of motion picture camera sadly his acting doesn come close to making up for his looks if you have been following along up to this point this shouldn surprise you meyer stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets dolly reed plays kelly the leader of the band and no surprise here she was cast for her cup size not her talents and yes she does loose the shirt few times and display her impressive talents sadly her ass is almost as large as her chest hey it sexist movie so writing sexist review then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in fairly small role as casey one of the other band members this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie meyer casts gorgeous playmate with rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all sure russ now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows on the up side she does have fun lesbo scene sound like writing review in porn magazine but hey ll admit it the only reason that actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch look at cynthia myers naked and since that was huge disappointment pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey the only thing that can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet this is movie that should be avoided at all costs an even better idea might be to require video stores to place warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls beware this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense proceed with extreme caution
by the numbers film which introduces characters situations dilemmas and developments that we ve seen before in parade of other films film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one film which is packed to the cap with predictability leading to very little tension excitement suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience in short clich ridden formula film welcome to my review of the general daughter plot an undercover army detective and rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughter rape torture and murder they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules and the hush hushes to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder critique by the numbers see above this film is just there it sits there on the big screen for couple of hours floats around goes away hopefully never to be heard from again it is so predictable that even blind man could see its plot points coming mile away it as suspenseful as leaf dropping from tree it as action packed as canadian curling tournament get the picture sure did it too bad that it took my friend and less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot and to break down each scene before it was even completed easy as pie it unfortunate because james woods and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film but alas was not to be that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted woods chews it up in the few scenes that he in travolta passes the test cromwell plays well cromwell and stowe is window dressing with smile mia since 12 monkeys 10 it seems and this predictability isn reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or few good men it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen it like riding bike other scenarios which sponge out any tension suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually breaking down to the investigators without much reason given ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly and directorial style that can only reward director simon west with solid nomination for the best poor man michael bay doing his best poor man impression of tony scott add two scenes with sunlight shining through some half open shades for grit and integrity and an all out rainfall for the finale for further chaos and you re great director yawn yeah whatever tony mean simon and aren we all sick of hearing about these army bad boys and their overdone code of silence enough already next subject please see it on video if you wanna fall asleep after seeing much better movie like an officer and gentleman 10 otherwise save yourself the trouble and go take crap instead you ll feel much better afterwards trust me little known facts about this film and its stars ironically john travolta turned down the lead role in an officer and gentleman which eventually went to little dickie gere ironically on james woods part he completed one of his earliest acting roles on tv welcome back kotter starring none other than john travolta actor james woods recently confirmed reports of his big dick on howard stern radio program unlike rocker tommy lee woods is also alleged to have an iq of 180 he apparently scored perfect 800 on his verbal sats and 779 on the math section what man john travolta is married to actress kelly preston and they have son named jett travolta loves them planes word on the street is that the kid was apparently conceived during weekend at demi moore and bruce willis home director simon west first film was the jerry bruckheimer produced con air 10 before that he directed tv commercials including the budweiser ad with the dancing ants yippee veteran director john frankenheimer ronin 10 the manchurian candidate portrays the character of general sonnenberg in this film the imdb reports that when senator robert kennedy was shot at the ambassador hotel in los angeles on june 1968 it was his good friend john frankenheimer who had personally driven him there that day clarence williams iii who plays colonel fowler in this film is known to some from his role as linc in the original mod squad tv series younger folk may remember him as prince father in purple rain
pokemon the movie has lot of bad things in it first of all it plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents badly written script and fantastic animation the first film came out the end of 1999 and was huge hit grossing almost $90 million domestically sequel soon followed and even made $45 million warner has released their third movie based on the immensely popular video game and tv series and its waste of time and celluloid this time ash ketchum and his friends are on their way to the johto battles which my little brother told me the new spinoff is pokemon the johto journeys so go figure anyway he comes in contact with young girl who father has disappeared after trying to discover the unown they are small pokemon with powerful punch and have great psychic abilities the unown bring together their psychic abilities and create entei powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly house and creates every wish she wants now it up to ash and his friends to stop this pokemon entei and show him to be good pokemon rather than bad one too bad really that this is bad movie surprisingly the first movie was entertaining and somewhat absorbing the second was piece of trash and this one is almost in between it has some good qualities animation message in the end but the flaws seem to overpower the goods still not sure what the big thing is about pokemon they are ugly little animals who speak their own name for their language besides meowth my personal favorite and you don understand what they are saying my little brother just thought the movie was amazing and kept leaning over and asking him happened or what pokemon that was his response was big lecture of how this is that and that is this he sure did put me in my place with the second and third movie being bad have feeling pokemon the movie might be total bust as well pokemon the movie has some redeeming qualities for the kids and the pokemon fans will dig every minute of this film for those parents and or brothers and sisters who have to sit through this bring pillow
he doesn have hard to decipher accent he doesn always speak in monotone and his face doesn always wear the same impassive expression in short the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad but too bad to be good unfortunately the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle firestorm which is just plain awful one of the most glaring problems with long who made his acting debut in john woo broken arrow is that he so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery as ace firefighter jesse graves long is supposed to be playing bigger than life action hero the kind of he man who will crash through flaming door to save child or parachute into burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers unfortunately despite the best efforts of first time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner work in the postman look stark jesse turns out to be pretty boring good guy to put it kindly this is not well written motion picture firestorm is collection of howlingly bad lines set against backdrop of disaster movie clich which taken together form something that requires level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as plot the only reason this film is getting one star instead of something lower is that most of the fire sequences are realistic and was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively we re introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of forest fire to save group of people during this sequence our big burly hero proves that he also sensitive guy by risking his life to save little girl and her dog yes the dog lives from being broiled alive flash forward year now our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins real actor scott glenn but this day our big burly hero first in charge isn going to be business as usual group of nasty escaped criminals have set wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom led by randy earl shaye william forsythe the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border along the way they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress suzy amis eventually our big burly hero is placed in position where he has to fight the fire rescue the damsel in distress defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die and restore order to the galaxy firestorm director dean semler is former cinematographer he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves so it no surprise that the film looks good unfortunately that firestorm lone asset and it falters near the end when computer generated special effects fill up the screen these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on nintendo 64 video game the action sequences which include variety of chases are occasionally interesting but never invigorating everyone including long appears to be going through the motions there isn memorable performance to be found from beginning to end unless you count the forest fire which generates some heat as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die william forsythe lacks panache he worse than generic bad guy he boring generic bad guy who doesn have any snappy one liners to hurl at our big burly hero my advice to scott glenn absolute power and suzy amis titanic is to accidentally forget this film the next time they re making out resume there some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that already have one entry for my bottom 10 list at least hope there aren 10 worse films than this and know wasn the only one who really disliked this movie as the audience was filing out of the screening loitered in the theater lobby to catch few comments the general consensus seemed to be that although the movie sucked the promotional key ring was cool the problem is that fox won be giving out key rings to regular movie goers so that nixes any reason to see firestorm
seen at amc old pasadena pasadena ca in sdds paul verhoeven last movie showgirls had bad script bad acting and plot use the word in its loosest possible sense that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity it stank starship troopers has bad script bad acting and plot that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore it stinks nobody will watch this movie for the plot but here brief synopsis anyway some friends straight out of high school sign up for the federal reserve armed forces at time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the other side of the galaxy after one slips through the defences and destroys buenos aires the home city of the main characters war is declared this involves sending the grunts who include johnny rico van dien and dizzy meyer down to the surface of the bugs planet much carnage ensues the troops are withdrawn and sent to another planet to answer distress call more carnage ensues after being rescued their plans are changed to capture brain bug which is believed to be controlling the aliens battle plans look didn write this ok yet more carnage ensues get the picture interspersed throughout all this are brief ads from the federal network which present the picture of neo fascist state much like in verhoeven robocop there are many problems with starship troopers the plot where one exists to drive the movie onwards is silly harris star of tv doogie howser md is presented with psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in the movie apparently so we will accept his ability to mind meld with brain bug later on in addition the first thirty minutes of the movie until the characters sign up for service drag on like bad episode of beverly hills 90210 the characters are one dimensional so much so that when dizzy is killed she says it ok because she got to sleep with rico had hoped that verhoeven use of no name cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience but such an idea appears to have escaped him the dialogue is embarassing and isn helped by the frequently terrible delivery almost burst out laughing when harris delivered his speech about the need to sacrifice few hundred people for the good of the species finally the fake ads become nuisance although they evoke the propaganda of the wwii era movietone reels as presumably they are meant to their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect some people will say all of that irrelevant the movie hinges on the battle scenes so what about those battle scenes well admit the effects are good the bugs move about quite convincingly especially when they have been deprived of few of their limbs and people have their brains blown out their limbs cut off and their bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways but this is my problem the entertainment value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore and its continous attempt to gross us out starting early on when richards character vomits on screen verhoeven appears to be trying to make movie employing the elements that made robocop success but fails spectacularly while robocop had message about the importance of being human and gave the bad guys some motivation starship troopers lacks even these simple features when the brain bug sucks out character brain near the end of the film it merely an analogy for what the film has done to us this film is full of graphic violence and is not suitable for children under 16
often similar to little boy lost in park that he had no right venturing into the call of the oboe toque do oboe is disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray many elements of the film are solid and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know but they simply don convert into solid work although setting is never established it becomes apparent the film takes place somewhere in latin american village in present day the community is dull one where every day is downhill slide from the last over time the people have taken to themselves the town cinema is closed no tourist has passed through in years and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger so what happens when tourist paolo betti does arrive one day he sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock it is revealed that he is musician who plays the oboe as hobby when he sits down in the park one day to give solo performance the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years it is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to silent film thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages the woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner leticia vota who also happens to be engaged to the town police inspector figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance involvement with this musician the rest of the plot closely resembles freak show gone horribly astray it features character who literally rises from his grave woman who has phone conversation with god and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character to an almost humorous drunk technically this film is nightmare the music score is poorly edited into the film so it is often choppy rough and abrupt the lighting is poor at best which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be relevant fight is filled with dialogue but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words in addition the pace of the film seems uneven it opens with series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one patience the film then moves into faster pace that again slows towards the end as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark there was however potential for this film it is piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music and the re unification of people these are all topics that could easily fill movie perhaps if there were no freak show and the technical aspects were to improve there might just be thing of beauty at the end most importantly though the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours aren such bore until then there seems to be little more hope for this piece than that boy has by simply crying out mommy while he wanders astray in park
friend invites you to movie this film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare and be grounded in reality the plot is as follows after terrifying incident mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city they need fresh air to get some perspective maybe to start over romance begins to brew however as one of the locals played by an international superstar in rugged clothing sparks things up especially at country western slow dance it stars rising young starlet helms good cast and is directed by one of the better actor turned directors in hollywood you accept you jump at the opportunity to see what you believe to be _the horse whisperer_ but poor moviegoer you have been conned alas you find yourself watching incredulously _hope floats_ oh woe your hope has sunk why was this movie made why was it released it is travesty on nearly every level and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved at the hands of better script the film could have been gem but it is clueless as to what it is about and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers _hope floats_ stars sandra bullock as birdy who after discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend on national television no less takes her daughter and drives back to her home helmed by countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands she decorates with stuffed wildlife birdy nephew travis played by _leave it to beaver_ cameron finley is under her custody and in one of the film many failed in jokes is always seen wearing different halloween costume what is the point of this does it make any sense is it supposed to be funny the point of the film is to show that the family is eccentric but was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of child all of this undercuts the plot of which there is none there are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion there the scene where birdy who used to be the prom queen is humbled by approaching peer she once mocked for job there the scene where birdy dances with her father in the hospital for alzheimer and then there the sentimental scenes with justin played by harry connick jr who is taking liking to her again showing her beautiful pad that he built from scratch and during each of these scenes was sidetracked by my earlier question what sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great pains as to provide dog costume kermit costume cowboy costume with whip and full furred barney costume for her grandson to wear during dinner what sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest of his life outside of this there are other sure signs of screenwriters block when the daughter stands up to the bully at school when birdy almost loses her job when the family pulls in goofy lip synch to cheer someone up when someone dies when the daughter cries no wails in exasperation that her father is not coming back in movie like this you notice the strings being pushed and you sit there comatose hoping it will end who can survive such debacle worry for bullock career which has been running on auto pilot for the last few years she has an attitude solid perkiness and can drive bus but she can handle the emotional scenes much less hold southern accent harry connick jr is worse stick with singing or get some acting lessons please gena rowlands is the best part of the film but she such good actress that it staggers the mind that she weighed down by such lukewarm material here it would be severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes great films is known for this film two notes to forest whittaker cut the slow motion sequences there are twelve times where you undercut your own direction by such failed trick have you done so you could have shaved off ten minutes of this almost unbearable debacle you ve had to know something was wrong if your cinematographer filter makes the candlelight appear like little you re not bad director but you can change terrible script there recurring scene where birdy working at the neighborhood fotomat finds the machine go wrong and image after destroyed warped dark image appear think about it succession of destroyed images may have been more entertaining than this movie
any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project as perfect murder illustrates frankly dial for murder is not one of the master director greatest efforts so there is ample room for improvement unfortunately instead of updating the script ironing out some of the faults and speeding up the pace little perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial for murder leaving behind the nearly unwatchable wreckage of would be 90s thriller almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what going on so that these flaws in logic don become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled unfortunately in perfect murder the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they re happening this is very bad sign not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder of course in the case of perfect murder at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless cardboard characters perfect murder isn strict remake of dial for murder but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott play which was also the source material for hitchcock version as well as 1981 made for tv retelling emily hayes gwyneth paltrow is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover and shaker steven hayes michael douglas their marriage isn going well emily resents steven controlling instincts and as form of rebellion she is having an affair with penniless painter david shaw viggo mortensen when steven learns of the relationship he decides to confront david but his approach isn that of typical cuckolded husband instead of yelling or threatening steven offers david proposal that too good to resist for $500 000 in cash $100 000 before the rest after he is to break into steven new york apartment and kill emily of course after getting the first payment david never bothers to ask how he supposed to get the rest ultimately not sure which of the three main characters we re supposed to be sympathetic to the cold hearted husband who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune her mercenary lover who is willing to do the deed for half million or the woman who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair not only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable but they re not interesting it possible to make good movie with detestable characters see reservoir dogs but there has to be something compelling about them which in this case there isn steven emily and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes the actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks michael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep he gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife gwyneth paltrow who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors is simply awful here she now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998 worst thrillers the other being hush at least viggo mortensen jane has little fun with his part but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies the thin supporting cast includes david suchet the star of poirot as police inspector and sarita choudhury kama sutra as emily best friend perfect murder is plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end there aren many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start it surprising to see director andrew davis the man behind the fugitive involved in this mess but like his stars he too needs to earn living it just that remaking hitchcock and doing it so badly hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough
steve martin shines but sgt bilko fails to impress based on the popular 50 sitcom sgt bilko follows the string of old sitcoms to movie conversion fever remember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back brady bunch was moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy but the tv conversion movies are hitting our screens like wildfire sad to say with mixed success such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following the more likely the sitcom will be made into movie sgt bilko frankly have not seen any its original tv version even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd failed to entertain sgt ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool place of vehicle storage and repair of fort baxter though totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out money making opportunities from running gambling den in the military garage to pools though materialistic in mind bilko methods has thoughtfully `enriched the lives of the men of fort baxter providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that colonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn `blissfully confused state bilko has managed to hide his operation though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it bilko state of ascent is suddenly under fire when the pentagon sends major thorn tough cookie on army regulations to check on the progress on the $70 million hovertank project new weapon under development within the fort grounds to add to his problems thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of major `sabo done on him by bilko during their younger army days director jonathan lynn who directed my cousin vinny in which marisa tomei won an oscar for best supporting actress managed to pull sgt bilko through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of laughter but that is about it there are really not enough laughter packed moments in sgt bilko to fully entertain the average movie goer still steve martin sgt bilko is played with finesse and full force by the renowned comedian without him sgt bilko would have just fell flat on its face sgt bilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year but doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world the current trend in mixed successes in such tv conversions may be blessing in disguise really at least it will force hollywood to re think any of its initial intentions to turn another tv idea into movie or at the very least approach those ideas with more creativity unless you are fan of the tv series or love to watch steve martin in action you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres sure there are better ones around
look the new version of psycho came out and the world didn end guess gus van sant really isn the bringer of the apocalypse unfortunately though that psycho didn end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it van sant controversial re telling of alfred hitchcock classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere even before it premiered without benefit of an actual viewing many have said that the film will at best suck being an almost good critic waited until actually saw it to decide that the film at best sucked and that concludes the use of the word suck and hopefully the thoughts that am brain dead orangutan director gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it shot for shot using the same exact script with few minor alterations the inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary even though large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original sadly that did not occur it is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin from the original psycho but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen in moore case the film would have been helped if the files gillian anderson had been cast instead especially since moore goes through the entire film doing scully impression from the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming sentence moore is scully mortensen who liked in jane opts to play sam loomis as cowboy hick which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point sam has twang and cowboy hat but that about it mortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory anne heche in the janet leigh role does few good things in her brief time on screen at least her marion crane has little life in her which can be said for most of the rest of the cast the best work though comes from vince vaughn as the demented mama boy norman bates he not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins but he is effective both in being naughty and nice the best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn where they simply talk there is some solid acting there something that is not carried through the rest of the film van sant has made boring film all the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 aren as eye catching now what passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they don impress or excite van sant in what assume is grasp at originality decided to put some stream of consciousness images into few famous scenes was that lamb in the middle of the road these images included with some questionable editing choices took away from the scenes themselves and caused at first bewilderment and later laughter definitely not hitchcock intention at least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmann original famous and terrific score if film like psycho does not frighten then what the point aside from norman the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience there are things van sant and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting in the end however the new psycho is noble attempt but alas dismal failure
an american werewolf in london is john landis groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by werewolf in jolly old england the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects more specifically the makeup used for the transformation of man into werewolf and for the ghosts that haunt the main character even twenty years after its release that part of the movie is still impressive although would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive the rest of the movie is run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure if it weren for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 and with good reason the acting isn great and neither is the writing well ok we don actually expect either of those things to be great in horror film but one other important element is lacking here too it isn scary with no exception you know what is going to happen before it happens you don even need the obligatory scary music to give you hint will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that have ever seen but john it just wasn scary didn know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it but it didn work for me actually it was intended as sort of spoof on horror films but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad the intended humor was lost on me it never good sign that you don realize movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material call me crazy but you shouldn have to do research on movie to enjoy it not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up werewolf bites boy david naughton boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse jenny agutter and then strange things begin to happen to boy including and must admit this is very nice touch visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital the neat thing here is that his buddy is rapidly deteriorating corpse know it sounds strange but it actually works the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy griffin dunne are really the best parts of the movie as said probably the only reason that this film was hit was because of the special effects while they are still impressive today they aren impressive enough or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film and since they are more or less the highlight of the film there are far better choices out there if you want scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch actually the 1998 sequel an american werewolf in paris is more entertaining since it doesn take itself as seriously and actually provides few more laughs along the way
capsule annoyingly unentertaining obvious and paper thin buddy cop drug sexy witness movie presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock ve seen this movie already said as looked at the box art no haven even seen trailer for the movie don even know what it about but can look at the way they re promoting it and know ve seen it already thought it about these two cops and they re buddies sort of they re at each other throats lot but they really do like each other and everyone else in their department hates them cause they re hot shots and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship and one day they re in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying and the bad guy is drug lord and there witness and she this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down only missed the bit about the badges the rest got dead on and hadn even left the video store yet the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo smith plays cop who has trust fund and is thus not cop for the money martin is family man shades of the now tired lethal weapon dynamic here whose wife and he are at total odds this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence not getting any and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house thinking his partner is now his wife back door man not funny tiresome bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith and martin lawrence will smith is natural and happy to see him in movies like six degrees and men in siyah he funny and charming without trying to be he really does seem to be enjoying himself martin lawrence is different story he so uptight and verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are trial movies like this are not about originality know this they are about style and energy and synergy between actors know this too and yet while watching bad boys which its glamorous photography and impossibly exact stunt choreography felt fed up seen con air which despite being completely implausible was still great fun because it tried however feebly to put some new life into the mix bad boys is dry run and overlong too clocking in at just over two hours with lot more by play than felt could be justified could write this movie you could write this movie many people have many people will continue to write this movie over and over again other people will buy it from them and make it and we will pay money to see it more the fools we all in terrifyingly prescient line from his book scanner darkly phil dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger as he called it would eventually eclipse money as the token of cultural and financial exchange one day we will all just sit in our living rooms and sell the same burger back and forth to each other the same could be said about this movie have the sinking feeling we re going to see it again soon
in the first death wish movie mild mannered new york architect paul kersey played by charles bronson was avenging the death of his wife in the second he was avenging his daughter in the third he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend fourth movie on the other hand begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen played by kay lenz however since this is death wish movie we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for this time karen teenage daughter dies of crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways kersey new targets unlike the previous movies aren the ordinary street punks but rich heavily armed and well connected drug dealers even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support and it comes from the publisher nathan beyaz john ryan determined to avenge the drug related death of his own daughter white plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them the plan begins to take shape but kersey actions bring attention of two police detectives reiner george dickerson and nozaki soon teck oh fourth and unfortunately not the final installment in the death wish series will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade however although some critics might argue death wish the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish paul kersey one of the most intriguing and potentially controversial characters of the 1970s is still being dumbed down by mediocre script and charles bronson really doesn feel the need to put much effort in his acting however the hand of veteran director lee thompson seems more capable of michael winner and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring there are some attempts for the movie to have plot between the numerous scenes of violence and one of such attempts is potentially interesting plot twist at the end the script even tries to fake some social conscience through criminally underused kay lenz character and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years there are even some half hearted attempts of humour both intentional and unintentional like in scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by wine bottle but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronson 1970s classics special note to philes mith pilleggi the actor who plays ad skinner in the files could be seen in small role of cannery lab foreman
ve never written review for movie haven watched all the way through but had to make an exception with powder was about forty five minutes into this one at friend house when he and his brother got into huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house so never got to finish the movie and sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of bad movie but can at least get partial review out of it because saw enough to know this one wasn worth finishing in the first place the movie centers around freaky teenager who spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents house when grandpa dies taking his department store down with him social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder first and middle names gold bond to state home where we find out he different from the other kids actually we find out he different when we first see him because he the most pale individual we ve ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie the father takes one look at him and says he not my son obviously all want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago so the white faced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids that is until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him wear his spoon you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass decisions decisions and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into giant pile in the middle of the table so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy his mother must be sissy spacek carrie character and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes as we find out powder has some sort of super intelligence your test went straight off the chart and attracts electrical power this first shows up as powder visits the world of high school if he such genius already why would he need high school education and sits through demonstration in jeff goldblum science class goldblum plugs in jacob ladder device that shows current running up two wires and immediately the current flows across the room and into powder chest but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching instead of just unplugging the damn thing guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in row following hideaway and nine months that about all saw before the big fight began and let me tell you that was twice as interesting as the movie itself but like said saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization none of these movies ever handle the subject properly instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having beautiful woman fall in love with the guy personality overlooking his personal appearance

attention moviegoers you are about to enter meaning free zone should the sound system malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes do not panic the film will work just as well as silent movie chronicling the meaningless lives of vain yuppie types the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films last days of disco barcelona and metropolitan but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing first time writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth there isn one of these characters worth caring about the movie features such cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks like celluloid version of people magazine among others the movie features ben affleck casey affleck david chappelle janeane garofalo gaby hoffmann catherine kellner courtney love jay mohr martha plimpton christina ricci and paul rudd and unlike people magazine the people speak not that they have anything interesting to say it new year eve in 1981 and monica martha plimpton is preparing her big party structured as series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way to the party director risa bramon garcia flits back and forth among her stars monica apartment is in noho an area that one of the guests describes as so cool all of the poor people live there typical of the shallow couples in the movie are kevin paul rudd and his friend and would be sexual partner lucy courtney love they argue about whether lucy is slut or not since she sleeps with everyone except him of course she dares him to go immediately to bathroom stall and have sex with her which turns out to be neither erotic funny or successful rather like the rest of the story the movie gets its title from the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his new year eve birthday cigarettes are shield against emotional interaction with other people kevin later tells lucy in snippet of dialog that sounds profound only outside the context of the movie another character played by jay mohr has problem with his sexual triumphs every woman he beds falls deeply in love with him by the next morning when his latest conquest tells him of her affection for him his response is like lot of people as the movie finally draws to close the characters awaken from their post party game of musical beds some have passed out early from alcohol abuse and remember little while others actually have some clue as to what happened the movie itself is so forgettable that by the time you reach your car in the parking lot all trace of the film will have vanished from your mind which is probably the best thing that can be said about the movie 200 cigarettes runs 40 it is rated for profanity sex and one dope smoking scene and would be acceptable for older teenagers
have nothing against unabashedly romantic films when done right with at least slightly evident restraint they can be engaging sweeping appealing but it hell of shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle hollow boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers the ones willing to buy into ephron whiny views of life and romance tom hanks and meg ryan two of hollywood most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed repectively baldwin wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son jonah seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse jonah senses tension and calls talk radio show to tell the world about their problems sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out ephron has him do this so that annie reed meg ryan can hear it annie is happy woman she is engaged to walter an allergy prone working man and seems to be perfectly content but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it five years after this movie hit theaters hanks ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better although still sub par romantic comedy you ve got mail which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet at least that movie had sense of spontaneity here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie donnell but none of them can save the film from being bore its characters are dull and empty its script isn funny or particularly charming the script has fundamental problem annie gives up for little reason her life with walter to pursue sleepless in seattle whom she has never even seen it the kind of life decision that real people don make and its major unforgivable plausibility sacrifice in essence this movie purpose is to head towards goal that shouldn even exist it ten minute short film with ninety five minutes of filler if you were to show me sleepless in seattle and didn have to review it you could just call me asleep in philadelphia 1999 eugene novikov&#137
if you ve seen the trailers or commercials it rather difficult to really figure out what this movie has in store well it hard to tell after watching the movie as well bruce willis is resident of the future and it is rather bleak future the world population had disintigrated into mere 200 000 and is no longer ruled by humans but animals the reason in 1995 an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world with pure virus thus wiping out practically the world population in mere month bruce willis character is one of the surviving few but is enslaved by scientists as are most of last living humans they barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment and having him do the ultimate task go into the past find the leader of the army of the 12 monkeys and kill him well this explanation didn come easy although the movie is very thought provoking of us as people our future and the evilo in the world as story it is very confusing and dragging know movie isn keeping my interest when fidget in my seat or feel the need to look at my watch only to find that it only been an hour passed terry gilliam has certain style that realize many appreciate and haven watched his previous work brazil but this movie felt like it took too long to tell and yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy to figure out you wish it were more complex and not to mention that the movie is depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me
house on haunted hill 1999 starring taye diggs geoffrey rush ali larter famke janssen peter gallagher bridgette wilson max perlich lisa loeb james marsters and chris kattan directed by william malone written by dick beebe house on haunted hill initializes itself to the audience with scene involving zombie like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible one doctor is killed instantly after having pencil rammed completely through his neck nurse has her head forced into barrel of water these mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous horror flicks with grunting noises and cadaverous movements except this time at the end of the millenium the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be in past horror films the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims house on haunted hill doesn want their audience to have an imagination everything is provided for them to watch and squirm not think this nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film house on haunted hill which is based on the 1958 film of the same title introduces handful of characters as quickly as it can following the opening blood fest the film has no intention of providing character development or laudable plot the aim here is to scare the audience with chilling unexpected shots of blood guts and mayhem however the film is neither scary nor unpredictable the plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner geoffrey rush each character is failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money since the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them the problem is that every character is not likable the two who come closest to being civilized are womanizer taye diggs who should be doing films lot better than this with all of his talent and businesswoman who accepts being womanized ali larter the characters presented are so annoying and pathetic that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them the worst character in this film or maybe in any film released this year is chris kattan watson pritchett he spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in tone so irritating and inappropriate that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself waiting for pritchett to die was strenuously difficult act to sit through the most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price an homage to victor price who starred in the original playing the rich man who supposedly organized the party he plays the role perfectly in twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face however rush is pretty much wasted in confusing subplot involving hateful marriage with evelyn price played by famke janssen the main problem is that house on haunted hill is not scary to top off that huge disappointment every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous if the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped similar to deep mavi sea the goal for creating creepy suspenseful action film was completely missed

marie couldn talk paulie the parrot star of his own movie tells us about the daughter in his original family dad couldn listen and mom couldn cope so they got rid of me paulie the autobiography of talking not merely mimicking parrot has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird the voice not the body and as the minor character of benny small time crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms as the parrot mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up benny on the other hand is character you ve seen thousand times before and mohr brings nothing new to that role roberts deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig script lends subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems when kids movie wants to mosey along watch out if the material is not crisp and perfectly composed beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium so it is with paulie when they let their bird do his stand up comedy routines the show hums and the audience roars too often however sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they wait for the story to pickup again tony shalhoub the smart mouthed chef from big night plays misha recent russian immigrant to the he had been teacher of literature at home but now he makes his living as janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study although misha gets few nice lines russian like long stories his somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy besides paulie the only character worth noting other than cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands is the speech impaired marie played in precious performance by cinematic newcomer year old hallie kate eisenberg naturally enchanting she gives the picture genuine heart the bad news is that her part is confined to the first half the best scenes have the bird dancing and strutting to show off his comedic skills when marie family gets cat for example the bird who hasn wanted to learn how to fly until then takes an instant interest in soaring tricking the cat while insulting him at the same time paulie calls him stupid hairball their rapid physical antics add to the humor of the situation it good quality sitcom material but performed by animals when one of the humans without much of voice begins to sing paulie cringes bird he explains with his frequently subtle humor have small brain and it about to explode the movie contains rich doses of john debney dreamy music with heavy use of solo violin he keeps reinforcing the film heart warming themes and when paulie finally takes off in flight the orchestra comes up loud and strong with cymbals clashing it long story says paulie it the only kind he knows reflects misha and the motion picture which runs the standard length for kids movie still feels too long the best parts are enthralling but then there are all of those dead spots in between paulie is movie that never quite lives up to its promise but manages to charm nevertheless paulie runs 32 it is raged pg for few mild profanities and would be fine for all ages my son jeffrey age gave the movie with his biggest complaint being that there wasn enough action he thought paulie was funny and the actress that played marie was quite good his friend sam almost thought the movie was awesome excellent and gave it he thought paulie was good but he didn believe the way marie speech impediment was acted
well here distasteful thoroughly amateurish item that surprisingly was actually box office hit at the time of its release after just viewing the film for the first time my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy this movie it is cheap idiotic unfunny and not nearly as raunchy as had heard it was at least some smut would have livened things up bit porky tells the story if you can call it that of four clueless high school buddies pee wee dan monahan billy mark herrier tommy wyatt knight and mickey roger wilson whom desperately want to get laid women for the most part are mystery to them and in this movie they are to the audience as well since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from different planet their plan is sidetracked however when they venture out to smarmy strip bar named porky which they are able to get into using fake id after they pay the manager one hundred bucks for three hookers they are played trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building for these four teenage guys this means war on porky porky ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level as teenage sex romp it is not wild or amusing enough as comedy all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat as look back at the 1950 it is something suspect most people from that era would want to bury deep in grave and as revenge movie it is crushing bore one of the most offensive things about porky is how jaw droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers the four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters and we learn very little about them except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in preschool that sure is revealing information the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark the women are all treated as objects or comedy props rather than real people for example the two gym teachers mrs balbricker nancy parsons and honeywell kim cattrall only have one purpose and that is to be made fun of mrs balbricker is gruff no holds barred overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness and in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved honeywell has sex with coach and barks like dog there is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses even though have the suspicion they are not but one thing is for sure they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny only humiliating to prove how out of touch this so called comedy is compare it to other more serious 80 films about teenagers and it looks even worse in comaprison any of the john hughes pictures such as 1984 sixteen candles or 1985 the breakfast club put porky at an even greater shame those films actually dealt with serious teen matters but remained great deal funnier thanks to their bright and truthful writing and heck if porky wanted to be teenage sex movie take 1982 fast times at ridgemont high or 1982 the last american virgin over this any day of the week director bob clark is not bad director two years after he made porky he directed the nostalgic holiday classic christmas story would forgive him for this misfire in fact if it wasn for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay just the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such piece of garbage and think that it was actually film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world is actually whole lot funnier than anything in porky
okay just don know why but seem to be getting this diversion to disney made real life actors movies as well as real life acting tim allen movies couldn even make it through the santa clause so why did even see this just to make an idle point did like toy story but that was good also have this aversion to bad french farces and if they remake them into american films well this is my excuse it was prom night not prom person my best friend and impulsively went to the drive ins where they were playing grosse pointe blank wouldn mind seeing it again but had to suffer through this first agreed to go ugh in all fairness can say that at least this inane plot wasn dreamed by an american it was originally french film released in america under the pseudonym of little indian big city french title un indien dans la ville stayed away from it like it was limburgher and according to roger ebert that was good idea but can only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement the stupid plot concerns father who just learns he has son from his current marriage let me clarify his wife jobeth williams left him years ago and mean years around 13 or so and went to an island in the carribean or something he goes to her to finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry this thing played with an emphasis on over done by lolita davidovitch who is usually good she tells him he has son as his boatman goes off he meets him he has weird name mimi seku think or as the bad joke goes mitsubishi laugh track cue he knows english they fish more bad jokes pirhanna joke the kid has pet spider he makes promise to take him to the statue of liberty you know the drill now this is where the plot complicates well complicates for this one at least the fish out of water joke switches from tim allen on an island to his island son in new york city tim is stock broker and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died and he wasn able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is martin short russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere how come in every hokey french import there is mob tim learns lesson of life from his son and we discover that cellular phones can operate on an island even though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries the story is crap the jokes are hokey and not really funny and the actors have to struggle to make it interesting but the material is so fowl that even rewrite by quentin tarantino couldn help it the whole time kept thinking that grown person had to think this up and several more grown people had to do this at the end of filming did they all scream out we ve made great movie guys sure hope not big question to get from this film why would someone want to remake what was billed as one of the worst films of all time if they re just going to do it the exact same way huh my for some of the actors names and joke or two that made me chuckle guess okay so really feel bad for it so only gave it one star
the beach is structurally confusing film that can only describe has having multiple personality disorder every forty minutes of this two hour film begins with new theme virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act it starts off purposefully as film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in dangerous environment but then in the second act the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes story about love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of mavi lagoon forty minutes later the mood changes once more and it becomes dumbed down version of lord of the flies where an isolated community is discovered where their moral code touts maintaining sense of bliss at all costs by the time it over you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about the main character of the beach is angst ridden richard leonardo dicaprio he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you re looking for good time richard voice over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into world of the unknown this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for he checks into fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy robert carlisle he seems like raving lunatic obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis though his jagged behavior would distress most of us richard listens to him as he speaks of mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen moreover the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make small city high for life captivated by the idea he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richard once they finally arrive at this paradise however the mood of the story shifts to richard growing desire for francoise this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard etienne is about as exciting as fluffy beyaz sand it odd that etienne never sees this coming but paradise has way of hiding potential threats just out of view and once the three stumble across the hidden community mood shift imminent more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers for example there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards and the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark there are several ideas that are introduced in the beach and each one could merit its own feature length film there the man vs nature angle the love triangle angle and the utopia gone awry angle but the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred dicaprio as result has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through consequently the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up
the most absurd remake of 1998 it toss up between gus van sant psycho and mighty joe young the new disney picture based on the old rko picture knew was in trouble when polished computer generated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits there is no great demand for another giant ape movie make that ape movie period witness the quick deaths of buddy born to be wild and congo and while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable it also an assembly line product through and through lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it theron is jill young as young girl in the wilds of africa she befriended baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers that baby gorilla nicknamed joe grows to immense proportions and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers enter conservationist greg paxton who convinces jill to move with joe to california where they can protect him better in controlled environment joe is restless at first no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in plotting joe demise suffice it to say the movie could have been called joe ape in the city theron so good in devil advocate and paxton so good in the recent simple plan are fine actors but not fine enough to transcend the material paint by numbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising the plot arguably borrows more from steven spielberg the lost world than the 1949 original with the computer generated rex mean joe wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third with jill shouting look joe headed for the movie theatre followed by shot of joe scaling mann chinese theater moment later jill shouts again something like look joe headed for an amusement park and what do you know there joe at the pallisades carnival scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers the seams of last minute edits to mighty joe young show unrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves the movie sure feels uneven regardless act two is underdeveloped while little of joe smashing cars in act three goes long long way underwood tremors speechless was perhaps not the director for the job even the plentiful untamed landscape looks dull in his hands capturing the beauty of nature requires more than his point and shoot style did enjoy certain sequences especially the demoliton of black tie dinner sequence and the prologue however implausible is touching as tyke joe acts just like rick baker make up effects and puppetry are outstanding the real star of the show yet for all its technical flawlessness the creature remains too grumpy and homicidal to love his facial expressions are variations on scowl to be fair saw mighty joe young in cinema packed with wailing children it wonder was able to decipher the dialogue it certainly not film for very young kids intense fighting scenes may scare them while any time joe not on camera may bore them to tears note older boys are more likely to be dazzled by theron colourful array of tank tops suspect bland mighty joe young is passable entertainment for family outing but they sure don make em like they used to
in 1990 the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of above the title stars patrick swayze demi moore and whoopi goldberg eight years later moore and goldberg careers aren exactly thriving but they have had their share of screen successes since the same can be said of swayze who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named siyah dog forget the mortal kombat movies this trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games good truck driver jack crews swayze must drive cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey along the way jack and his crew of three run into number of obstacles such as highway weigh station evil truckers and deadly uzi firing motorcyclists every so often like at the end of video game level or stage the main baddie pops up kirmizi meat loaf fresh from the triumph of spice world who wants to steal the cache of guns just in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of who driving what all of red vehicles be it pickup or big rig are painted you guessed it red could go into more of the plot specifics such as jack dream of having nice home with his family the past trauma that sent him to prison and cost him his trucking license the fbi atf crew tracking the cargo but they are of little importance all that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point to point but they fail at even this modest goal for none of the highway chaos as credibly staged as it is is terribly interesting let alone exciting once you ve seen couple of trucks bang against each other or big rig explode the first time you ve seen it every time as dreary as siyah dog is as an entertainment the saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen it that swayze has to reduce himself to such work while far from the best of actors he is certainly not horrible and he is charismatic presence don know if it his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as siyah dog regardless if he continues on this career track could tv series be far behind
these days we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old cult tv shows most of the times the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past but some five or six years ago there weren that many movies and the trend didn look that depressing so the people who like the author of this review grew up watching flintstones popular 1960s animated series about modern stone age family weren particularly worried when the word came about live action remake after all the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and if anything else at least the special effects would be good the plot revolves about flintstones family set in fictious stone age town of bedrock whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america fred flinstone john goodman works in the quarry and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble rick moranis and his wife betty rosie donnell to adopt baby to return the favour barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred and based on that fred gets well paid job in management but of course this is just sham corrupt official cliff vandercave kyle maclachlan and his sultry secretary sharon stone halle berry need scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme in the meantime fred wife wilma elizabeth perkins must face her mother elizabeth taylor who can stand fred on the superficial level the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life computer effects are flawless and the costumes settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show unfortunately problems with this film start with inadequate casting rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie donnell but the greatest problem of all is plot or to be precise the lack of plot some thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame original characters one dimensional and many elements of the story like embezzlement and inter office politics totally incomprehensible for the little children the main targeted audience of this film result is almost unwatchable mess occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as high concept after great hype movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version all in all film isn that bad but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it
after 1993 falling down hoped that joel schumacher would mature into great director since then he has offered us two so so adaptations of john grisham novels the client and time to kill and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise although these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher potential the publicity for his latest release 8mm raised new hope it promised to be something unusual it wasn the plot goes like this tom welles nicolas cage is private eye who is hired by wealthy woman allegorically named mrs christian myra carter to investigate an 8mm movie found among her late husband belongings the movie appears to be snuff film in which teenage girl is raped and murdered by man in leather mask who reminds me of bane in schumacher batman robin because murders can be realistically simulated in movies mrs christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead by combing through missing persons reports tom finds the girl name and tracks her to los angeles with the aid of max california joaquin phoenix video store clerk and another symbolic name tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff the plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schrader hardcore in which father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter both films are modeled on dante the inferno of course 8mm makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward meeting with the devil hardcore is much more subtle and meaningful film 8mm had lot of promise in its better moments it an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even nice guy like tom one moment of the first sort when we first meet max he reading truman capote in cold blood underneath the cover of porn novel in cold blood was the father of the true crime genre which is the literary equivalent of snuff films max promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom dance with the devil and the devil don change the devil changes you tom does change ll let you discover the specifics for yourself but not permanently schumacher and screenwriter andrew kevin walker didn have the guts to take tom so far down the dark tunnel that he couldn come back walker seven did much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise cage tries hard to pull it off but the script doesn give him enough to work with phoenix walks away with the movie he smart charming and funny other cast members include fargo peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet and the sopranos james gandolfini as soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far in the last analysis since 8mm falls short of its pretensions and its promise its just another private eye story in the raymond chandler ross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege however unlike other predictable fare in the genre last year twilight for example 8mm is especially disappointing because it could have been much more than it is
think of know what you did last summer as the movie that scream and scream could have been mind you though mean this in the worst possible way know what you did last summer is typical slasher flic without the smarts of the scream as result it even worse than some of your better campy horror pictures see nightmare on elm street because it thinks it about thirty times smarter than it is based on teen book of the same name and disappointingly adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson know what you did last summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with some startling cinematography of cliff along the ocean and an angsty sort sitting at the top the appropriate mood being set this is angst horror for the 90 we cut over to the july 4th parade in small north carolina town from there we see the blond female protagonist helen shivers woodenly played by sarah michelle geller getting crowned croaker queen as the blond male hero barry cox woodenly played by ryan phillipe and matched brunette pair of protagonists julie james and ray bronson woodenly played by party of five jennifer love hewitt and freddie prinze jr respectively cheer her on after getting drunk at party going to beach to wittily discuss urban legend and indulge in some foreshadowing and having some meaningful sex if you believe what the characters say the four run down some guy crossing the windy cliff road at night his face is mangled so they can tell who it is and they come to the decision to dump him in the ocean so as to not ruin any of their future chances for success in the world cut to one year later the lives of our protagonists have gone from annoying to bad main brunette female the bright one of the bunch has been plagued with guilt and almost failed out of college blond female has forfeited her dreams of starring on guiding light and now works at the family store in town brunette male is fisherman living off the land blond male has become complete jerk and quarterback on some college football team then predictably their past comes back to haunt them it all begins with an irrational murder followed by some taunting of protagonists by the mysterious killer bad acting by good actress anne heche an improbable plot bad acting by the main bad actors some more killing concluding in climactic scene mostly climactic in the relief at the end of the movie all the while the actors and actresses spout off bad lines and main brunette male does his best keanu reeves imitation not that the movie was without pleasure count the illogical plot twists and bad lines for some fun mostly though note the costumes of main females and how trendily unattractive they make the otherwise eye catching pair look

one of the 90s most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave it the ___ from hell movie starting in the early nineties we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationships from hell there were boyfriends from hell friendly neighborhood cops from hell nannies from hell and even secretaries from hell but hush has found an old standby that somehow was forgotten in the rush the mother in law from hell the mother in law in question is martha played by jessica lange she has been single handedly running the family horse farm kilronan her son jackson johnathon schaech and his girlfriend helen gwyneth paltrow live in new york and have no intention to move back down south to the rural kilronan but those intentions are about to change you see martha lives by manipulation she has used it in years past to breed many championship horses now she believes she can use it to breed herself grandson though at first helen finds martha charming soon she is caught in the domineering martha web of deception it hard to understand why nobody ever wises up to martha schemes as written most of the characters in the film must be very slow witted but then the film even treats the audience like idiots it tries to get away with things like leaving critical piece of evidence in rather unlikely place without even batting an eye then again an audience which accepts characters as shallow as these isn one that likely to question details jessica lange martha is the only semi developed character in the film and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can character that could have been simply awful is merely groan worthy gwyneth paltrow doesn have much to build upon as helen only character trait seems to be daughter in law still she fares better than johnathon schaech whose character is so nonexistent he inexplicably missing for much of the film still there have been much worse ____ from hell films even with its paper thin characters and ludicrous setups hush manages to create few thrills in color by numbers fashion you know what coming but occasionally the film will deliver shock or two the old formulas are around for reason but that doesn mean they taste fresh

can imagine how good krippendorf tribe must have looked on paper it does not surprise me in the least that group of extremely talented actors led by the great richard dreyfuss and good director todd holland all wanted to make this film in fact it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf tribe as possible in retrospect can imagine how bad this film could have been shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss dreyfuss plays james krippendorf an anthropologist who is granted $100 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea halfway into his two year expedition his wife apparently dies say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established later we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big screen tvs and other such pleasures so when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely he decides to construct an elaborate lie he makes his own tribe using his three children as actors in video he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe which he calls the shelmickedmu audiences at krippendorf lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision and proof that the typical family unit is led by single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community like all films like this the lie becomes more and more complex and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero dreyfuss is funny talented man and he is funny in this film he has lots of positive energy and unlike most comical actors really manages to play people like this realistically this film also requires lot of physical humor that ve never seen dreyfuss perform and he does great job jenna elfman who plays veronica mecilli scientist who wants in on krippendorf work is also very funny and appealing here and the kid actors are great as well but we re talking about the script from hell this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew no the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean spirited characters that was in disbelief as watched furthermore the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless take for instance the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex they get all decked out in the tribe getup complete with paint to darken their skin krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe now saw this scene coming from mile away but said to myself no that would be far too tasteless there no way they ll do that oh god they did do it it there was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn bother the other audience members with whom saw this film found it deplorable and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice the film is filled with scenes like these they not only insult the audience but they insult the types of people that the film portrays it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon and watching dreyfuss stumble over completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining but think that most members of the on screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes if were an anthropologist this film would insult me immensely moving right along the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes sure dreyfuss dressing up like chief is really funny and it allows for some entertaining scenes but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that was able to watch this film his character here is not good subject for film because he is shameless liar and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case but for the purposes of good taste would have expected something no this man sets terrible example for his kids and colleagues and the writer of the film charlie peters didn include single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad in fact it his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing and he continually shrugs off her warnings suppose it important to admit that this is funny film dreyfuss and elfman and many of the contrived and insulting scenes add up to picture that is anything but boring and if you re less serious than you probably will enjoy it however can get past these elements krippendorf tribe is being marketed as family comedy but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldn be learning with little more insight into its story and themes this could have been good movie
after marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors mission to mars ends up throwing whiffleball fiercely unoriginal director depalma cobbles together film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13 interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001 space odyssey instead of using these components as launching pad to create his own movie de palma stops right there refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart mission to mars takes it first wobbly steps at pre launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done during these surface scans of the characters we learn that jim mcconnell sinise has lost his wife it plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety the rest of the crew exhibit bland affability there is no contentiousness no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff but in that movie the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects it the year 2020 and this is nasa first manned excursion to the kirmizi planet crew led by luke graham cheadle arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly which they investigate with tragic results graham is able to transmit garbled distress call back to earth in response earth sends rescue team comprised of mcconnell woody blake robbins wife terri fisher nielsen and phil ohlmyer connell obstacles are put in the crew way and and they matter of factly go about solving them should say mcconnell goes about solving them time and again mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind which wouldn be so bad if the rest of the crew didn come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in situation where the entire crew mission and life is in mortal danger on team of professionals she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link women serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as reflection of male character personality trait by the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with heavy brush there is an adage in film to show don tell mission to mars does both repeatedly characters obsessively explain the obvious explain their actions as they are doing them explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them the film conclusion is momumentally derivative anti climatic and unsatisying as walked out wondered who the target audience might be for this film the best could come up with is pre teen age boys but in this media saturated era this film components would have been old hat even for them have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making good modern day movie the key to such venture is certain depth and sincerity towards the material felt no such earnestness
some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have good time playing god asks just one simple eensy teensy thing so it can fully entertain you it accomplished in just four easy to follow steps crack open your skull scoop out your brain squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one congratulations you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy whole lot of nothing some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been good movie others are simply good ideas that are badly executed then there playing god which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of drunk director actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and bunch of rip offs or homages as they like to call it from other better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet harsh maybe justified hell yes this is movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes for example gunman bursts into garden with the two guns in his hands firing away this does look moderately kool but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling oooh look look john woo two guns blazing slooooow motion and if that wasn enough you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in tarantino movie poor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines you have to admire the effort he puts into it this guy deserves better unlike most movies this one does not suffer from stupid bad guy syndrome just to make things little different this time we get stupid heroes example duchovny manages to distract bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages now the bad guy is like stoned man so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero term used as loosely as possible survival instincts and good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun which our hero does but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it going so far as to actually wonder if he should place finger near the trigger mind you ve never fired shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs be he stoned or not some will argue that our hero does not have killer instinct the hell with that two fbi guys have just been shot in front me along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second solution boom ll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of building and that he might be running into room full of people with itchy trigger fingers he still has his shotgun bring it along you say no thanks ll just ditch it in the back of my car and the real kicker is this when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised while we are on the subject of getting shot why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door ve got no formal training but even know you never sit with your back to the door ask mr wild bill the first and only time he did not sit with his back to wall cost him his life this is the major problem with this movie any mook could have thought of hundred ways to make it better is it so much to ask that hollywood actually put little common sense into their characters for instance our heroes hide at duchovny summer home now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment ok this time our hero does get himself gun and has it at his side most of the time but see our hero is drug addict and guess what he chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt oh sure he ll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling going clean is really honorable of him but would have waited until did not need to be conscious or being able to fire gun for an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton plot holes the size of godzilla getting our intelligence insulted and several oh come on moments
preposterous religious action film produced by the trinity broadcasting network about code hidden within the text of the bible that when deciphered will lead to the end of the world nice of those bible authors to put doomsday code into the most read book ever eh michael york plays millionaire diplomat who breaks the code and sets out to become god on earth and fulfill the doomsday prophecies while casper van dien terribly miscast and giving an awful performance as result plays the atheist motivational speaker who must stop him michael ironside great as always despite the silly film surrounding him plays fallen priest and right hand man to michael york character here some subtle character development you may have missed pertaining to ironside character now despite the fact that we see him murder man in the opening scene the filmmakers aren quite sure if their audience will understand that he is evil how do they fix that make specific efforts to show that his character is the only one in the film who smokes there are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking oooooo scary but even that wasn enough for the filmmakers apparently as they later have to infer that ironside character is gay it comes out of nowhere and just makes no sense my main problem with this film is that despite the silly story which could have been pulled off anything can be made believable if executed correctly the events of the film aren shown with any sense of urgency or importance for example at one point york character is declared chancellor of the world or something and we see one brief cheesy news report about it the movie keeps telling us that the apocalypse is coming but it never seems that way there no world reaction to anything the omega code is available on dvd from goodtimes home video it contains the film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 85 and includes the original theatrical trailer documentary on the making of the film production notes and cast and crew information the documentary runs about 25 minutes and is actually surprisingly good it looks as though it was made for broadcast on tbn and it does comprehensive job of interviewing practically everyone in the cast and crew with the exception of michael ironside unfortunately the best thing about it is that whenever crew members are interviewed they do an excellent job of explaining their profession and exactly what it is they do on movie set most documentaries tend to overlook this doomsday expert hal lindsey is even interviewed you ll remember his documentary from the 1970 called the late great planet earth where lindsey speculated that jimmy carter might actually be the antichrist however at the very beginning of the documentary the producers of the film managed to get on my bad side when interviewed they actually have the nerve to say ever see raiders of the lost ark well our film is like that no it isn not by long shot [pg 13]
america sweethearts has an intriguing premise and great cast but it isn nearly as edgy or funny as it should be almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co script writer billy crystal who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co hosting comic relief charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg two other paragons of self indulgence crystal ignores simple but crucial rule for screwball comedy to work the characters must be placed into rigid social setting because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous america sweethearts takes place at press junket where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters it promising set up but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules thus dissipating the tension of the situation by the end of the film all the lead performers participate in huge fight with room full of journalists looking on but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed john cusack and catherine zeta jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector hank azaria spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together six crossed the $100 million mark but the prospects for their final effort space opus titled time over time are far from rosy while eddie has spent many months in new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup gwen solo films have tanked to make matter worse the director of the movie christopher walken visionary who purchased the unabomber cabin and had it moved to his backyard is withholding the film from the studio insisting that the first screening be held at the junket desperate to win over the press the studio elects to hire lee billy crystal recently fired publicist to salvage the situation lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation he enlists the help of kiki julia roberts gwen sister personal assistant and whipping girl what lee doesn know is that kiki is in love with eddie fact that could temper her effectiveness press junkets are haven for control freaks studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in plush hotel with food and drink always at hand generally on the evening of their arrival writers are bussed to see the featured film then ferreted straight back to the hotel the next day writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews every 30 minutes or so producer director writer or actor is brought into the room for few minutes of questions with publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression writers are free to ask what they want but understand that if the studio dislikes question they may not be invited to future junkets representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew with the studio filming the exchanges the reporters are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars but to play it safe the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs placing two spoiled actors in setting where image is everything is inspired but the screenplay undermines the conceit the junket is moved from the handsome but highly confining four seasons hotel to plush resort near las vegas for most of the film the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds completely safe from the eyes of the press when they do deal with journalists the it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters premise is de clawed gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll they scream at each other in restaurant filled with the media and at the screening of the movie everyone connected with the film goes nuts all without any repercussions lee certainly isn bothered by any of the infantile outbursts in fact he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors hell no they feel lee is genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie all of which underscores how billy crystal and co writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise the comedy in america sweethearts is based on barely in control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters except that it doesn matter because any publicity is good publicity and thus the very set up for the film implodes leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter so what about the cast julia roberts at her best playing the underdog is utterly charming here although could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in fat suit and not very convincing one by the way catherine zeta jones makes believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic by casting himself as the publicist billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on comic relief stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks in supporting roles hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed too broad seth green is amusing as toadie stanley tucci is very good as ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair though he has little to work with come to think of it little to work with is the operative phrase for this movie as hollywood satire america sweethearts is toothless as romance it is at best minor pleasure such good cast such waste of their efforts had it not been taken long ago better title for the film would have been much ado about nothing
do the folks at disney have no common decency they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects embarrassing writing and kid friendly slapstick wasn mr magoo enough people obviously not inspector gadget is not what would call ideal family entertainment younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness but their adult companions may feel wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80 minute exercise in glaring stupidity the movie is poorly edited grossly manipulative and the finished product resembles somewhat of failed jigsaw puzzle all the elements are there but the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite as huge fan of the 80 animated tv show the first thing must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain in the cartoon dr claw was frightening raspy voiced presence who remained total mystery to the viewer we never saw his face he simply sat back in his arm chair watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat as child always imagined what dr claw would appear as and this curiosity kept me watching for many years with the release of the live action movie the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed it rupert everett only now dr claw is simply known as claw `one word he explains `like madonna he sports shiny clamp instead of the steel glove and seems far less interesting than the animated version it helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic but he overplays the role entirely too far when all is said and done this wasn very wise move on the part of the screenwriters the infamous dr claw has been turned into wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool he does still have his cat though in the title role matthew broderick looks lost the actor while usually downright charming doesn know exactly where to take his character fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers broderick first plays friendly naive security guard named john brown who dreams of becoming cop and upholding the law for the good of the people he has mad crush on pretty scientist brenda joely fisher who has stumbled upon new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics but one fateful night her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen by fiendish millionaire everett who wants to take over the world john courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames in full body cast he is chosen to be the first human prototype for brenda work revolutionary crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys and so is born inspector gadget as bad as this movie is it does have certain charm in isolated scenes broderick actually fares better playing robo gadget an evil and destructive clone that claw has set loose on the city and there are about two or three amusing punch lines the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates rampaging monster with shadow puppets on brick wall and japanese man flees the scene while screaming `this is why left tokyo alas the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to in favor of not even cracking slight giggle there are so many tired plot additions gadget talking car voiced by hughley is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian both are wisecracking non human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children well it just doesn work in fact zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this and don even get me started about the villains didn mind everett performance but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust the characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles penny michelle trachtenberg and brain the dog now have little to do with the action and chief quimby dabney coleman has lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action the special effects are everywhere but not so annoying they will cause your eyes to peel over the problem here lies solely in the script perhaps the next time disney attempts remake like this they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancy schmancy visuals here is one critic crossing his fingers anyway
if you haven plunked down your hard earned money yet for wild wild west the latest summer holiday offering from will smith let me say right now that your money will be better spent on starbuck frappacino or on ben jerry sundae these treats are great relief from the summer heat in contrast this film made me simmer in disappointment can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take back seat this was true of star wars episode but at least in that film the story and the characters were still in the back seat in this film they are no where to be found what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats lots of female extras who look like can can dancers and clunky 80 foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles mechanical tarantula two men are asked to stop this threat one is artemus gordon kevin kline an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest the other man is jim west will smith who prefers the shoot first then shoot some more method of investigating although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success their interaction with one another merely seemed like second rate two man vaudevillian act for example there is scene where west being more debonair than the reserved gordon notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat which is what it is currently filled with now touch my breast west says gordon does so and then softly coos his approval found myself groaning at this kind of silliness the script fails to generate any sense of drama humor or fun for that matter did enjoy kline reserved performance but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith could it be that will smith is just so bankable that he not even required to act it was as if the director was yelling will smith do your own thing and action here an example in this scene will smith is about to be hanged by group of angry beyaz people he must endear himself to the crowd to escape the director yells will smith do your own thing and action in another scene he has to masquerade as belly dancer in order to save his comrades will smith do your own thing and action worse still the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is horrid mess there are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers going up and down everywhere you look there actually lot of imagination at work in this film there are some genuinely clever inventions and gizmos introduced but all of this imagination is wasted in film that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat and that too bad because if there was more focus on the story rather than will smith just doing his thing this film might have been palatable as it turns out wild wild west is the wild wild worst and receives my vote for biggest disappointment of the year
synopsis two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry woody harrelson an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into post tries to slap girl and gets poked in the eye has ill timed fits of coughing and fails at everything he does the story is told from harry point of view harry always carries around shot of whiskey although he swears he doesn drink one day harry is approached by the con girl rhea elisabeth shue who is similar to harry in that she carries around cigarette but swears she doesn smoke seduced harry agrees to participate in money making scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette chloe sevigny the teenage daughter of rich man turns out it all part of needless very puzzling extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme it involves hiring special impersonators by two cons in order to fool harry hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of wooden post when the kidnapped odette is found dead the clues point to harry as the kidnapper murderer and the police are hot on harry trail harry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money can he get out of this mess opinion palmetto is long uninteresting film with all the wrong feel hero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence this farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof but palmetto is played like dark serious detective noir drama and watching harry bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction there lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts buttocks short skirts colored painted nails and women legs even when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema you can always notice the side of elizabeth shue breast forming prominent foreground towards the end palmetto re focuses on plot for the grand finale confusing explanation involving impersonators with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over tub of acid as he hears the criminals confession if you can imagine shemp from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo lingerie suspense thriller that how out of synch this movie feels
there are scenes in the big hit that are so awful they simply defy description the movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made last action hero 1993 such chore to sit through presumably the big hit is an action comedy difficult but not impossible genre to pull off movies of this sort require fine balance and careful tone and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence lethal weapon 1989 is perfect example of an action thriller that was also very very funny unfortunately in the big hit it seems that comedy is the main motive and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs unfortunately there are no laughs the movie resembles some of the goofy throwaway ridiculousness of early jackie chan films but it doesn benefit from chan incredible stunts and goofy charismatic presence instead we are left with lot of digital effects and mark wahlberg who must have considered himself invincible after his critically acclaimed performance in last year boogie nights however if he wants to maintain decent career he had better start selecting his projects more carefully movies like this are sure fire recipe for long career in the straight to video market wahlberg plays melvin smiley an amiable guy who also happens to be professional hitman see grosse pointe blank for the same character much better developed the movie wants us to think gee how clever and ironic guy who can kill without any moral implications and yet he can stand for anyone not to like him the fact is melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee christina applegate with horrendous new york accent and an abusive girlfriend lela rochon who is only using him for his money his constant bending over backwards to please people makes him complete patsy at best and thoroughly unbelievable character at worst melvin is employed exclusively by crime boss named paris avery brooks as part of team of hitmen which also includes cisco lou diamond phillips and crunch bokeem woodbine one day melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter of rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi sab shimono for million dollar ransom however not only has jiro nishi lost all his money producing big hollywood movie inside joke get it but his kidnapped daughter keiko china chow also happens to be paris goddaughter so when paris finds out she been kidnapped he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it not knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper of course cisco blames the whole thing on poor innocent melvin along the way there are several obligatory gunfights explosions and car chases plus literal cliffhanger inspired by jurassic park and completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko who looks like she barely pushing fifteen what the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers hara kiri drinking problems leaking body bags and running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation and now spends all his time doing hand exercises not to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of king kong lives which is two weeks overdue this mess of movie was helmed by che kirk wong the latest hong kong director imported by john woo face off who also served as executive producer woo needs to stop acting as conduit for other directors and start making more of his own films wong who directed such films as rock roll cop back in hong kong is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy maybe jokes about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are funny across the ocean but they re not here at least in the manner wong handles them many of the problems can be traced back to the script which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey in addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences ramsey script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet style dialogue what he comes out with is just lot of annoying blather most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips whose favorite phrase is it all love and robin dunne who plays cisco stuttering black wannabe assistant the irritation factor of phillips and dunne combined is almost off the scale which can pretty much describe the film as whole
well guess it that time of the year again the one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even try writing script that has more dialogue than explosions it also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies pull on their siyah vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases in america they call this time summer and it happens once every year and maybe it the exposure to all that nasty sun that does it but in the process normally weak insipid lines like consider this divorce hasta la vista baby and you re the disease the cure actually do end up being repeated more often then the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs this is not entirely bad thing of course what am talking about talking about the summer blockbusters the action thrillers the this obviously cost lot so you know everyone going to go explosions gas threats flying saucers and special effects in the rash of my what big guns you have but wait mine are bigger movies there are also the usual boy meets fish and saves environment movies or whale whatever and this year the odd crop of save the world from aliens or environment threats offerings talking about the three batmans the speeds the terminators etc this year talking about twister independence day the arrival the rock mission impossible and of course eraser here in singapore as our local movie critics like to whine we seem to get the pick of the crop of my explosion is more real looking than yours movies but nothing else mission impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did in the us the same goes for eraser which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called mission unavoidable on account of its worldwide mega advertising blitz eraser seems like cheaper less thoughtful imitation that saying lot because mi the movie was already cheap thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the 60s 70s in eraser arnie is us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger he does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence and re situating them with new identities his new case is lee cullen played by vanessa williams who unlike all the other scumbags he ever relocated is an actual real life honest person because she so good and has such nice legs arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her and only uses the opening movie sequence to save robert pastorelli from his killers lee obtains evidence that the high technology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated black market arms to people with foreign accents and stringy hair of course as the formula goes her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck there are people in high places who will go down with this because yes this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world that is america since watergate in protecting lee arnold is framed by the mentor turned evil robert deguerin nicely played by james caan and ends up having to prove that he isn the one killing the programme witnesses in addition to making sure lee isn accidentally torpedo ed to death by the new green guns his enemies all have it around this time that people in the theatre with me starting humming the mission impossible theme because arnie mission includes breaking into high security building to run disk guess should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in this movie is so antsy about it an electro magnetic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles and which can see through walls it has some sort of ray vision so its user can target the victim heart even from great distances despite this which figure is pretty cool feature in gun though certainly no expert however arnold whose own heart is targeted number of times never goes flying 10 feet backwards with two foot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun instead he outruns and outsmarts his trackers each time giving eery and ironic resonance to that terminator line that practically made him famous ll be back like everyone else in the theater left the movie feeling that the trailers had duped me because they made me want to watch this movie voluntarily although there is lot of violence in this movie not to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators recommend this movie to most over 18s who need some therapeutic mindless action to get over the weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas review rating system wait for the video little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
the rapid fire formula that worked so well in airplane the police squad television series top secret three naked gun films and two hot shots movies has finally reached desperate dead end with spy hard even ezio gregio the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over extended spy and action movie spoof leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd 40 who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis general rancor cackling andy griffith the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly hint of restraint timing or tact most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags recreated movie sequences and soggy star cameos yeah maybe we do need ray charles driving an bus bound for speed bump but did mr hulk hogan and dr joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing nun habit even the resulting sister act spoof is silly as are the bits directly lifted from home alone pulp fiction true lies etc etc adolescent males might enjoy this mess tho the butt shots breast peeks penis pokes flatulence gags and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead alley beyond the hilarious title sequence with weird al yankovich performing the theme song spy hard is barely the stock that it printed on my recommendation duck in while you re waiting for another movie to start stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al nostril and then leave you won miss thing
tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance and into studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi tiered marketing materials for crap movies and here he hits rock bottom with planet of the apes didn expect much from this latest interpretation of pierre boulle classic novel planet of the apes mean how could you top the force and impact of the original film intelligently co scripted by rod serling of twilight zone fame combined with the overbearing chuck heston growling and yelling at those damn dirty apes in one of his best roles of his career sadly sat down to watch burton version of planet of the apes and within the first 20 minutes was checking my watch and my girlfriend big fan of the original film started to nod off this time around the story plays out like cross between enemy mine braveheart and project marky mark wahlberg who was enjoyable in boogie nights and the corrupter plays leo davidson hot shot air force pilot leo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic storms no real explanation given in the film and leo sends one of his genetically altered smart chimps into the storms to collect data leo and his crew lose communication with the chimp leo hops in another ship to find the monkey and then he thrown through some type of time space wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle leo ends up getting captured by group of talking apes and is sold to slave trader named limbo paul giamatti who in turn sells leo to chimpanzee named ari helena bonham carter the kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leo ship along the way monkeys played by tim roth overacting his role of vicious general named thade and michael clarke duncan who further enhances his career by playing another heavy in bad action movie strive out to hunt down leo and his band of human savages just like battlefield earth in the end it all culminates into another braveheart rip off human versus ape battle scene while rick baker makeup work is amazing the script is pathetic hodgepodge courtesy of three writers the acting is horrible and the surprise ending feels like swing from ball peen hammer into the temple wahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences this remake or re interpretation as tim burton has proclaimed it is an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film the ethical arguments about the equality of species fascism and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue an unimaginative narrative structure and romance between monkey and human even chuck heston anti gun tirade in the de rigeur cameo seems shallow and jokey but the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton even though his name is plastered across every billboard in america john badham could have directed this film even joel schumacher could have directed this film he probably should have burton predominant themes of rejection isolation and the search for one place in the universe as seen in ed wood edward scissorshands and pee wee big adventure are completely absent in this planet suppose that what happen when great director gets sucked through wormhole
the premise of this movie is well pretty far fetched tom berenger plays shale mercenary who is temporarily out of work those fools at the cia have denied his existence just because he and his buddies botched job in cuba fortunately his girl friend diane venora teacher at christopher columbus high school in miami gets her knee cap broken by disgruntled student creating job opening for shale as substitute teacher not telling his girl friend who might object on pedagogical grounds he creates number of fake higher degrees for himself from yale harvard princeton et al and begins his tenure as high school teacher the students junkies drug dealers gang members sleazy sluts ice pick wielders you get the picture don really take to him right away so he hits one in the face with can and breaks few fingers this gets their attention to certain extent so he tells them the story of the vietnam war see some homeboys from the north tried to muscle in on the turf of the homeboys from the south oh yeah now they can dig it the problem is just that nobody ever explained it properly before but wait there are drugs being dealt in the school itself and behind the whole scheme in cahoots with the head gang the kod no not cod but knights of destruction really is none other than the upright ex cop principal played by the forgotten ghostbuster ernie hudson so shale does what any good teacher would do he gets his buddies together they gather together bunch of bazookas and other major weapons explosives and cool stuff like that and they have big showdown against the drug dealers and kod at the high school ok so the premise is not just far fetched it downright dumb if this were hong kong action comedy we might just accept it but it takes itself far too seriously to be truly fun oh it has its moments how one can truly hate movie in which huge really huge amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses and to be fair it is almost never really boring as the action is interrupted by only short sequences of actual story but over all this is pretty much made for tv movie with more and bigger explosions and more foul language in fact it reminded me of miami vice without the production values babes in skimpy bikinis and pastels if you can sneak into the theater without paying go for it otherwise wait for video the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get reaction from you either find his helium voice crazy eyes and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying think fall into the former category one of the few who thought his turn in the fifth element as prancing prince like deejay was complete inspired lunacy and not the least bit aggravating but his new vehicle money talks just doesn do him service tucker is good in the movie and this is the kind of film that if people see it could make him big star but he also really the only thing good about the movie in fact if you see money talks it should shock you beyond recognition that two of toy story writers penned the sloppy script tucker role here is that of franklin hatchett petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell charlie sheen after being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports franklin finds himself on bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard gerard ismael but villard thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist franklin is allowed to escape as well but not before overhearing some important information regarding diamond stash that for some reason or another is being hidden in vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo the local media mistakenly puts the prison break out blame on franklin which is where james comes back into the picture he makes deal to protect franklin if in turn franklin gives him an exclusive interview this means james must present his new friend in the stickiest of situations formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace heather locklear also attended by her uber rich parents veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino and of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james this ain no buddy movie claim the print ads yeah right actually for the better part of oh 20 minutes it appears money talks has the momentum to cover entertaining ground and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker this is tucker first leading role and if you imagine slightly lankier african american jim carrey with reliance on wild rated raunch rather than pg 13 physical comedy you have good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role but you realize all too quickly that tucker overstated liveliness is the only thing money talks has going for it and lively actor alone does not successful movie make it all too easy to pick out everything wrong with money talks the plot is recycled buddy buddy comedy thriller tripe that seemed overused even when nothing to lose employed it last month everything is paint by numbers especially the los angeles coliseum finale which finds not one not two but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers the villains as many as there are are dull certain story elements are too coincidental and too much of the film dramatic agenda is played too straight scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin true identity you brought killer into my parents house is extremely silly you get the picture obviously did not have pleasant experience at money talks but the people around me appeared to be having rip roaring good time one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction began fearing for his health but tucker at least for me is pretty funny guy and aces the movie best scene where franklin passes himself off as vic damone son at james and grace engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry beyaz lyrics tucker audience and he does have one will probably like money talks those who he irritates however will have more productive day staying home and scraping the gook out from under their toenails
soldier by director paul anderson is film in which any presence of originality is fleeting the best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russel character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision brutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has lot of emotional potential power behind it and the opening scenes tap into it little then it goes nowhere with that idea there is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches ve ever seen the whole idea of the inhuman soldier type character gaining some degree of humanity by defending potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done and it been done much better was able to predict the plot of the _whole_ story which wouldn be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting between the action sequences it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes since his dialog is extremely limited his performance in that way isn all that bad but certainly is not enough to carry this film other performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all and they generally are about as weak as their characters but enough of this stuff about plot and character right isn the most important part of an action film well the action even in this aspect the film is disappointment in mortal kombat 1995 director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining however he fails to repeat that in this film the combat scenes particularly the big one at the end is incredibly unimaginatve fighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type of movie point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed to realize but instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with it goes for the old shoot em up one guy vs an army type of cinema that thought died with the military action films of the 80s if the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously it could have been rather engaging science fiction film however it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that making the film big disappointment
the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for secret mission he attempts to pop couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth but misses after they ricochet off his face he says not good start as it turns out this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence but to the rest of the movie as well in this the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong chan plays an international operative codenamed condor and is tasked by the united nations with finding stash of altin hidden at secret base by the nazi during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war for some reason condor is given his mission at the embassy in spain think this may have been done so that in chase scene they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over fruit cart watch for it in any chase scene set in foreign country most notably in europe the chase will take itself through marketplace and fruit cart will be overturned it almost guarantee anyway condor is given key which is supposed to unlock giant vault in which the altin is hidden the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it which may mean booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly to help him figure out where the altin is hidden and how to use the key correctly condor is accompanied by desert expert carol cheng and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the altin eva cobo there aren supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something although these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts in fact most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just way to set up fight suppose this isn so bad since chan action is really the best part of the movie and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway if you ve never seen jackie chan movie don expect great plot but do expect to be entertained by his moves they are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human knowing that he does his own stunts and knowing that this is the real stuff no computer masked bungee cords here makes the action sequences all the more exciting you ve got to hand it to guy who probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art also of note in this as in any jackie chan movie is the humor as far as know none of his films take themselves too seriously and even the dramatic parts have certain tongue in cheek quality about them what is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes unlike martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme where the fights get you on the visceral level fight scenes in chan movies are simply entertaining you marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such way to make you laugh unfortunately even chan mastery can save this film the plot and characters are so weak that they don hold the movie together at all and the acting is terrible carol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past but since operation condor is dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off this combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until heard those kicks start flying
cashing in on the success of beyaz men can jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles including the cowboy way and drop zone wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed hoping that they can strike up the same success sadly if this dismal cliche ridden and mind numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by they haven got chance in hell of even coming close this time out the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops following several run ins with their tyrannical boss robert blake who is obsessed with the money train train which carries all the subway takings and will let nothing stop it now there an original plot device harrelson character decides to try and take off with the cash along the way both of them fall in love with the same woman another transit cop who also hates her boss this leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in film of this standard you were always the better brother etc etc etc and doesn help to add anything to the film given better script better performers in supporting roles and shorter running time the film almost went for two hours or did it just feel like it this film might and mean might have turned out okay but as it is it is stocked with the worst action film cliches whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time robert blake who plays the evil boss has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film history he sounds like wayne newton and appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as though they are about to burst out of their sockets but this is only one of money train problems if you look at the script as if it was an action film it lacks originality and suspense but if you try to look at it as if it were heist film it is even worse the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised and the characters definitely ain butch and sundance the film isn all bad though snipes and harrelson when they aren using the dumb cliches that the script gives them make an agreeable duo and some of the stunt work is indeed excellent but good stunt work cannot save bottom of the barrel action movie if you re really undemanding action freak there chance you ll like this but if you re looking for something original or suspenseful try somewhere else doubt you ll find it here
girl is in word mess was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film there was no sense of where the film was going or any kind of coherent narrative if there was point to the film missed it girl by the way is the way theresa randle character is addressed in the phone sex workplace all the girls are known by their numbers the plot such as it is theresa randle is struggling actress and eventually takes job as phone sex operator she begins to lose contact with reality as her job consumes her also she must deal with the advances of her ex husband isiah washington he is an ex con thief and she tries to keep him away while at the same time it clear that she still harbors feelings for him her neighbor jimmy spike lee functions as the observer mediating between the ex husband and girl he also functions as point of stability as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex the soundtrack consisting of songs by prince was jarring it kept taking my attention from the film not altogether bad thing ll grant you as what was transpiring onscreen wasn that riveting for parts of the middle of the film the music stayed blissfully in the background in the opening sequence and one scene later in the film however the music was particularly loud and distracting of course ve never really cared for prince or tafkap if you like music prince fans might love the soundtrack but it will probably be distracting even to die hard fans of the performances the only one that stood out was spike lee buddy character jimmy he was excellent as the always broke neighbor of girl he should have stuck to acting in this film there are several sequences that gave me the impression that he like to be oliver stone when he grows up there are scenes shot with different types of film which are purposely grainy and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stone natural born killers in that film they worked to propel the narrative in this film they just made me more confused there are some amusing moments and few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phone sex industry the multi billion dollar industry that it has become other than that though nothing much happens there are few intense moments as when one caller becomes frightening but even that is rather lackluster not the biggest fan of spike lee though agree that he has done some very good work in the past in girl though he seems to be floundering he had an interesting idea fairly good setup and seemed to wander aimlessly from there girl earns grade of
back in 1980s chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films he couldn of course top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot em up and beat em up genre aficionados that quantity was mostly provided by cannon group prolific production company that dominated the movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap formulaic and more often than not unwatchable genre products the hitman 1991 action thriller directed by chuck brother aaron is one of the last among them chuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed shot and left for dead by his partner which shouldn surprise anyone considering the fact that the partner is being played by michael parks specialised for roles of usually very mean characters surviving the shooting cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent he infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations italians french canadians and iranians since it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris at least not in this kind of movie the biggest attraction of this film should have been action well the action in this film falls flat it is boring repetitive and not at all exciting it is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films we know very little about norris character while on the other hand gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension in the end we almost feel sorry for them since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade during the film somebody obviously became aware of that problem so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the siyah boy who gets adopted by norris that caused another problem any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation the photography in this film is dark setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in watching it
as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding especially three times but alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber it amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything the whole point here is how could man be so blatantly forgetful this is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is professor well this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded along the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber thankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience the flubber is supposed to be flying rubber but it seems to have life of its own this is there strictly for the kids the properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs although amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone the poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at get his fiancee back finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire and do all this in the funniest way possible admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original the absent minded professor the whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable the basketball players stereotypically unqualified for the sport somehow manage to bounce fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning this just sounds too bad to be true the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film chance as for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie giving life to the flubber which is so poorly executed that it best forgotten and prof brainard flying robot weebo giving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasn for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in bit of music and extend the length of the movie the life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well but it wasn and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good now weebo is totally different story it robot that prof brainard created but forgot how and gave something of life too this is really original idea well maybe not but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie yes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters the film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all the acting by robin williams prof brainard seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced most of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to 12 people when stood up at the altar don usually give third chances or for that matter talk to the fiancee afterwards but what can be expected this is children movie flubber as movie does little original and is nothing special in any respect with the best character in the movie being something of prop doubt that many people will find it all that great it does have its amusing moments and it is good story in the end but it does not wash up to the original kids should find this movie amusing and fun and they ll probably enjoy the whole movie as movie it just kids movie and not the best of ones at that
how do you judge film that is so bad but intentionally so in spiceworld the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal mocking themselves with purposely cheezy film and having lot of fun doing it if that was their goal they did fantastic job so is it fair to give it such low grade when it wasn really meant to be much better than this honestly rather see this film before many others gave higher grades so does that mean graded it inaccurately truth be known don really think can answer this question to understand spiceworld you have to understand the spice girls unless you re very very young or fairly older you probably have at least heard of them they re group of five busty british babes who ve had #1 hit singles and whose debut album sold millions they re primarily adored by pre teen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spice real name geri haliwell wonderbra all five of the girls have these spicy names for which they are better known than their real names there is the aforementioned ginger spice as well as sporty spice melanie chisholm or mel scary spice melanie brown or mel baby spice emma bunton and posh spice victoria addams and all of them to some degree or another resemble their stage names the spice girls took the world by storm and spiceworld is actually good humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame it quite nice to see what good sports the girls are and not just the one dubbed sporty about poking fun at themselves they don take themselves too seriously and that probably the best thing about them it also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera acting and not just singing and dancing they re not flawless by any means but for the most part they deliver their lines without feeling staged and like them or not we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters which seems reasonable since they portray themselves what makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls won get enough of their music while the rest of us don get enough of movie the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes most of the film is very blas but several parts are downright boring and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud if you re big fan of the group you probably won get enough of what you want and if you re not big fan you get too much time devoted to nothing more than look at us moments for the right crowd the music video sequences will be the highlights of the film but for others they will serve as three minute lulls in hectic but overall uneventful storyline other key actors include richard grant as clifford the spice girls manager alan cumming as the film maker piers cutherton smyth who attempts to make documentary of the group george wendt as martin barnfield producer who constantly works on pitching spice girls movie and roger moore in small self parodizing role all provide relatively good performances keeping in mind once again that this film wasn meant to be acted seriously even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it while this film is continuously compared to the beatles hard day night think that is an unjust comparison it is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison by way of press kits but don think drector bob spiers nor the spice girls intended it to be so think the studios were just trying to boost hype and interest in the film and have instead come off rather pretentious don think this film is trying to be anything more than fun satirical look at group that got so big movie seemed the next likely step and what could ve been better than self indulged yet self mocking approach probably nothing and so it is spiceworld is movie thought would be embarrassing to enjoy but now instead find myself wanting to defend movie didn even give good review it bad but it succeeds in every way it intended it gives the spice girls chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment perhaps the group is nothing more than gimmick if that the case the movie gimmick is that it is such gimmick you might be saying spice girls movie come on but when it comes down to it think that the point
we could paraphrase michelle pfieffer character in dangerous minds and say that beyond rangoon starts with an that fair enough all movies like all school children should be given the benefit of the doubt the chance to succeed after all we like to think that the right combination of talent and effort can do wonders mountains can be moved and good movies can be made yeah right children fail as do films as does director john boorman latest the success of beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette ed wood true romance as the busty westerner in peril wandering about 1988 burma without passport though we can stomach the mild plot contrivances that get her there it tougher task to overlook the actress she lightweight as the first scene with narration demonstrates she doesn have nearly enough range for the emotions that her character mother fleeing the memories of murdered husband and son is supposed to show she may give stronger performance than say keanu reeves in walk in the clouds by not by much beyond rangoon is very physically appealing film thanks to the practiced craftsmanship of john boorman deliverance excalibur hope and glory he keeps the narrative moving no matter how muddy the story or the heroine gets why he chose arquette remains mystery though maybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies but even after an hour of half stated political statements and murky mass killings we still don know enough of what happening in this country to feel distressed for the characters or their situations empty exoticism the technical credits in beyond rangoon are curious mix combining lush jungle photography with bad blue screen work also odd is the obvious dubbing done to make some of the foreign characters sound less foreign and is it my mistake or do the same extras keep reappearing as different soldiers doo doo doo doo twilight zone theme or opinion of movie you be the judge
think that saying that the files is one of this summer most anticipated films is safe for five years the files television show has developed dedicated fan culture whose rabid devotion to the series

talents and the relationship between cinema and television first off the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy and cliched after approximately forty five minutes the length of television episode minus the commercials the pace drops to snail crawl not long after that point when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series we wish he had not the explanations are so trite and ridiculous that one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much am willing to suspend my disbelief fair bit but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much breaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie and listening to other fans leave the cinema maybe the series too the explanations are not only absurd they are tired and unoriginal the

comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people however rather

never happens in an american film meaning in cinema needs to be self contained and determined so when the files made that jump from small to big screen carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well he did not by making explicit what the television show left implicit carter reveals the limits of his creativity and skill when they say that fans make tv show it is

contrary to popular belief not every single foregin film released to an american market is masterpiece some of them aren even good some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful un indien dans la ville presented as little indian big city and remade into that crap tim allen flick jungle2jungle and this what could have been clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of french flick french twist the cool american title not the real one which was gazon maudit literally meaning twisted ground or something like that deals with married couple with kids and the intrusion of stranger who kinda screws things up for them loli and alain chabat victoria abril and alain chabat are not exactly happily married always on business trips alain chabat more than once cheats on her and she eventually finds out and one day she meets butch mechanic marijo the co writer director josiane balasko and they two kinda hit it off so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious sleeping with marijo but she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo but she also realizes she still in love with alain chabat so of course she does the obvious from that she decides to keep them both she ll be and sleep with each of them for days each then on sunday she ll rest by herself after all she needs it if she gonna have more sex than sylvia kristel the film goes on for over an hour and half through stupidity after stupidity moronic twist after moronic twist and soon there the little ironic ending know it completely different culture and quite familiar with the french and their cinema but this is just bad none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in fargo movie where stupid characters were backed up to make point and any action they do is pretty much just to get hopeful chuckle from the audience what shocking is this was not only one of france biggest hits but it was nominated for lot of cesars french equivalent of oscars the writing and directing is really the big problem with it josiane balasko does good acting job with her role but her little sex comedy isn very humerous entertaining or even deep at all even woody allen not very good midsummer night sex comedy is intelligent well written and possesses some depth this is shallow unfunny and pretty annoying to watch the film moves at the pace of snail and is damn near painful to watch thank god for the fast forward button the acting however isn bad at all the actors do the best they can with the bad material and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script and the fact that she stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people when she has kids and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband but french twist is just pretty lame it not overly horrible and has couple very very very brief moments but it just really crap film and an example of an ill advised distribution of foreign film
this well conceived but ultra sugary coming of age film is not for everyone and include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion joseph cross joshua beal is 10 year old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather loggia to bone marrow cancer loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such wholesome manner it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup the beals are like sitcom idyllic family where everyone is just so nice and affluent and properly religious without being fanatical the beals the father denis leary and his wife dana delany are both successful doctors julia stiles plays joshua older sister needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him this is family seemingly conceived in heaven but living in south philadelphia sending their children to well run catholic school joshua the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn is handsome sweet intelligent friendly and endearing child who does well in school relates to the nuns and priests and talks politely to his well meaning parents all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch the plot arises when joseph has problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather who promised to be with him forever his answer is to search for god pretty heady stuff for youngster his age to do but that just the way it is sometimes this search for god takes us nowhere because as his friend david reifsnyder says where can you look for him if he doesn exist now that smart kid but joseph looks for him in the usual places and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends one of his teachers is the kind hearted sister terry rosie donnell who wears philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball making him the clean up hitter and in my opinion if she wasn big tv star would have vocation as parochial school teacher she is that convincing throughout the film she is saved from answering any tough sic question about god by the bell as it rings to end the class nothing much happens in the search for god there is no parody of the catholic school though visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god but this is gentle stuff no real criticism or search for god is attempted what comes next into play is some hollywood hokum which is designed not to upset anyone as joseph has reassuring encounter with real live angel blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of goody goody the film ends as this angel tells him his grandfather is all right his quest is ended as apparently angels don have wings and are approachable and god well maybe that for another film down the road this part of the film was the final straw for me couldn swallow any more goo as this film flopped commercially his next one the sixth sense pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like rose though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts this director is loaded with hokum all he has learned how to do is hide the hokum better well god bless him if he can do that this is nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood it just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death children in parochial elementary school or for that matter about god and that family of his they re too good for words yet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place for those who want to see something soft without bite to it this is the one
battlefield earth is the best comedy of the year it has to be the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider bad movie syndrome struck me again so after witnessing how much battlefield earth has been proclaimed train wreck in both critical and popular circles felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first hand is it as bad as advertised oh yes very much so the plot is incomprehensible the acting is atrocious the special effects are mediocre the action is dull the implausibilities are legion the dialogue is cringe inducing the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny don even want to continue reviewing this movie like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory so here it is the premise is basically rip off of planet of the apes only minus the apes and philosophical discussion and plus race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo the year is 3000 the psychlos have conquered earth and the human population has been enslaved only handful of humans escaped to radiation rich areas to escape the aliens they live out their lives in fear one man johnny goodboy know know tyler barry pepper ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos there he confronts the psychlo head of security big ugly klingon looking creature called terl john travolta pressed into slavery johnny vows to lead revolution and take the planet back meanwhile terl is faced with his own problems he has recently learned that he stuck living on earth which he hates for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man daughter he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology this is where the plot gets ridiculous so the man animal can lead mining expedition into places the psychlos can go terl then plans to keep the mined altin for himself of course his plan doesn work so many things wrong with this movie where to begin how about with travolta whose hollywood clout brought about this the cinematic version of scientology guru ron hubbard sci fi novel early previews for battlefield earth with constant shots of makeup laden travolta cackling like lex luthor had me and several audience members remarking what the hell is travolta thinking the movie did nothing to stem such remarks all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here terl cackles after nearly every line and so does every other psychlo of course this makes every scene hilariously overwrought no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america but ceos generally don laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees you were going to be promoted but now you re not fwahahahahahahahaha it no big surprise terl loses to the humans he an idiot he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book he underestimates his enemies assuming he ll win just because he smarter he uses the word leverage like some sort of scientologist mantra not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero he hooks him up to machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos language and technology why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me he then appears shocked that johnny points gun at him no wonder this guy never got his promotion the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for altin when the doors of fort knox are wide open how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in hangar for 000 years and how do all these previously brain dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly there whole lot more to scratch one head about in battlefield earth bring scorecard to track the plot holes director roger christian shoots battlefield earth in the most distracting way possible tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason all the characters appear to be standing on the walls and it awfully difficult to watch movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue the action sequences are atrociously edited every one turned into an endless slow motion parade that drains all potential excitement are these things really so hard to construct my respect for supposed lightweight action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in battlefield earth how badly an action sequence can be shot this movie is an absolute headache it not just the shot selection and editing the movie quite frankly makes no sense for most of battlefield earth running time just didn know what was happening it didn have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical though they certainly are really had no idea what the hell was going on when pieced the plot together later it didn look any better here how much of disaster this is battlefield earth is already the worst movie of the year and it going to take something really really inept to top it the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it in fact think that hubbard cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible that ll teach me to give into bad

well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you because thats all that there really is found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot for one thing beyaz leading actor who has siyah daughter does leave some curiosity am not saying that this isn possible but it does leave one to wonder know did another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out and certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations there was one scene that should have been short but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it found myself thinking ok enough already get on with it there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort another thing that noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning this movie is also very predictable you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at given moment granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you also some of the things that happen are little too predictable and several cliques are repeated it gets boring at times to tell you the truth even though there is still action going on another little point might add is that the main character is supposed to be quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero some of the characters are not proper for their roles the acting is fine but the characters just don seem to add up if was to base my review totally on the plot then wouldn rate this movie too highly but that just the thing this movie isn just the plot its the whole package and this package is really well done the whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really movie the special effects are just amazing you can tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live in few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just wouldn be able to say that the creature wasn there during filming extinct or not another thing is the destruction scenes wow those were masterpieces well some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dino make this one of the reasons to see this movie this movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office unfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments go see it in matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me one little side note although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid there were 10 theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock think that some people really want money badly and think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have chance you know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made thought put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick its not that bad movie but its not that great either hope you people realize this
when film is produced on shoestring budget by couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of genuine tragedy the easy path for reviewer who hated the movie is to give it pass toss out your usual objectivity ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it forget how unbearable it was to sit through and find some meaningless way to compliment it this of course will be of no service to your readers but at least you ll avoid the hate mail from the movie fans thus it is with heavy heart that review the movie paulina not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about talking parrot directed by vicky funari as labor of intense love she spent the last one third of her life on film the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez paulina was maid in vicky household when vicky was young got to learn the film background when attended screening in which the two women who made it were present for those without such context the reaction to the film may be that it is parody of bad indie film the acting is amateurish the story is maudlin and it has all the visual appeal of bad home movie grainy and overexposed the movie shot on 16mm film and videotape has little to recommend it confusingly composed the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story quite bloody at times the story full of horrific images seems designed to shock and repulse us why else would you include scene with completely nude and bloody year old paulina another scene has teenage paulina being fondled on bus by the man sitting next to her in retaliation she bites off part of his finger this covers the both of them in bucket of blood the passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner one for example sees her as an aztec priestess holding out large heart that she had just cut from body the lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten certainly she had to endure miserable life but that does not guarantee that movie about her will necessarily being good felt trapped in the theater watching it only the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable paulina runs 28 the film is in spanish with english subtitles it is not rated but would be an for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers
in this year summer movie preview issue of _entertainment_weekly_ theresa connelly described her writing directing debut _polish_wedding_ as child that did not quite become the child thought it would one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film comedy drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements the family at the center of _polish_wedding_ is the pzoniaks which consists of mother jadzia lena olin father bolek gabriel byrne sole daughter hala claire danes and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness it large family but there not sympathetic one in the whole bunch certainly not in the primary trio jadzia takes pride in building and maintaining home and family but she kind of hypocrite since she carrying on an affair with businessman rade serbedzija her excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek who is such passive wimp that one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration also how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy sexy jadzia hala is spoiled self centered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy with such an unappealing set of characters it no surprise that _polish_wedding_ plot complications are far from involving naturally jadzia and bolek would like hala to marry the young cop russell schuster adam trese who fathered the child but he refuses to make such commitment ho hum another complication involving the decidedly un virginal hala being selected to crown statue of the virgin mary is first played for laughs and then inexplicably as profound statement in the film climax which ironically is funnier than any of the film lame attempts at humor such as painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in charge to beat up russell that scene is but one in number of writing miscues by connelly the jadzia bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers the hala russell conflict isn resolved in as contrived manner but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something and then there some atrocious dialogue which am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound look at all these pickles just looking at them gives me such great sadness as misguided as _polish_wedding_ is the affair is something of letdown considering the strong performances by byrne danes and especially the fiery olin they obviously believed in connelly and her material faith that audiences will be hard pressed to share
several days after having seen this movie still trying to determine what director christopher guest man whose sense of humor usually appreciate found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes this is dreadful motion picture lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs to jokes ratio there kind of desperation in the movie approach to humor that reveals the film makers uncertainty about how entertaining the material is the manic style betrays itself as last ditch attempt to hide the flaws of failed script the premise doesn sound especially amusing to begin with almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers the effeminate leslie edwards matthew perry and the uncouth bartholomew hunt chris farley who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest edwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies albeit of the early 19th century variety including frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages none of which prove to be useful pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest and bizarre man who suffers series of debilitating injuries along the way the intrepid explorers encounter bears bald eagles aging native american warriors and conquistador named hildago kevin dunn who raves about his beautiful hair the explorers trek takes them through forests across the snow capped rocky mountains and over waterfall this setup leads to lot of shouting great deal of lunacy and very few laughs farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing but aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle his heart doesn seem to be in it matthew perry one of the stars of tv friends who had some modest success in the romantic comedy fools rush in is badly miscast as foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy perry lacks the necessary edge of the proverbial straight man not big fan of david spade and didn like tommy boy but at least he and farley worked well together as far as the supporting players go none of them makes more than fleeting impression eugene levy is wasted and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla frankly it disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap the big picture and waiting for guffman although guest gets the costumes right this nearly inconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution the special effects such as they are are execrable for an example of some really poor mavi screen work look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids they re obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them and where farley is being carried off by an eagle even though farley didn have the most stellar of acting careers he doesn deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes while some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax few guffaws from 12 year old boys the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric farley fans who see this film as way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session
when was nine started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what was after for action figures they combined science fiction and fantasy had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read of course the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history given the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon not to mention its moderately successful spin off she ra princess of power it was inevitable that production company would put two and two together come with the result of trillions and make live action masters movie let be blunt masters of the universe is very bad movie the story is painfully dull and mind numbingly cliched hands up who wouldn guess he man and skeletor take their fight into the real world and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors dolph lundgren as he man for one or good actors james tolkan meg foster given such awful characters and dialogue that they can help but seem terrible it is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars we have the alien bounty hunters the desert skif technology stormtrooper lookalikes and musical score so reminiscent of john williams that deja vu is too polite term to use in describing it blatant uninspired ripoff would appear more appropriate tv fans might want to check out courtney cox monica in friends and robert duncan mcneill lt paris in star trek voyager very early in their careers and not doing to well in them either so in the face of such mindless sub mediocrity is there anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all yes there is one incredible good reason his name is frank langella langella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood appearing in countless films over the years here he plays skeletor the villain of the piece dressed in opulent siyah velvet robes and bearing skull for face he is one part darth vader one part emperor and two parts grim reaper given this character langella falls right into it with style and precision skeletor is believable interesting and manages to tread the fine line between being homage to the past and startlingly original in his own right masters of the universe remember loving it when was eleven at twenty one it difficult to see why but as said it is blessed with superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder besides this year marks the film 10th anniversary watch it with some friends for good laugh and celebrate
in gia angelina jolie plays the titular character the first so called supermodel and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome in my eyes anyway just don see how the life of model is worthy of two hour film despite this kept an open mind when began watching the movie sadly though my fears were realized it just not possible to make an interesting full length film about person who spends their days wearing different clothes the movie follows the rise and fall of gia no last name tumultuous woman who doesn particularly enjoy the world of fashion she becomes famous more quickly than she can handle and finds herself hooked on drugs and on woman she cannot have the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high losing job and going into rehab this formula is repeated several times and really got tired of it in general tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use no because it offends me or anything like that it just bores me quite frankly don see the appeal so when director shows me point of view shot of junkie complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices am left somewhat unimpressed the first hour of the film though was actually quite engaging we see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend these early scenes were interesting we re shown the fashion world through newcomers eyes and it was perspective hadn seen before the movie begins to go downhill however once gia becomes an established model >from that point lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end it all seemed so excessive fine so gia had drug problem does this really need to dominate the film couldn the same effect have been had with five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs or perhaps this film is meant to be warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world quite possibly although since have no desire to become model this warning is lost on me as stated at the beginning of this review simply don see how the life of model is worthy of feature length motion picture what do they do that warrants movie strut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players for example but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life gia did not and by the end of the film all knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling was bi sexual and was heavily into drugs not exactly meaningful contribution to society as far as concerned
talk about beating dead horse when home alone was released in 1990 it was breath of fresh air and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated genuinely funny family film the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed sequel so two years later we were subjected to home alone which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited for john hughes two home alone movies weren enough he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with including pathetic box office bomb called baby day out last year live action 101 dalmatians and this year flubber now inexplicably hughes has exhumed not only these worn out plot elements but the home alone name as well the result 1997 worst sequel edging out speed and batman and robin home alone by changing the characters hughes who wrote and co produced the film along with his co conspirator director raja gosnell has attempted to inject new life into series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest the new kid alex pruitt is played by alex linz one fine day and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness he not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was the villains pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber in home alone there are four of them olek krupa david thornton lenny von dohlen and rya kihlstedt but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls this time the kid isn left home alone because his parents have gone on trip instead he has developed bad case of chicken pox so he can go to school his dad kevin kilner is away on business and his mom haviland morris has to run errands so for the most part he all by himself during the day through series of coincidences too irritating to relate top secret air force integrated circuit comes into his possession it wanted by gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex home to retrieve it the eight year old who is wise beyond his years booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains the movie climax takes place during raging snowstorm only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable previously the most counterfeit looking snow effects can remember were in star trek iii these are far worse in fact the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near blizzard when shining sun can be seen if it wonderful life could generate real looking snow back in the 1940s why can home alone which has significantly larger budget and 90s technology at its disposal there has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live action cartoon violence for young children home alone will add fuel to the fire it one thing to see wyle coyote flattened by 10 ton acme weight but quite another to watch running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen adults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous but what about five and six year olds the level of violence in home alone is extreme many of alex schemes are nasty enough to kill but because this is family film no one dies despite being electrocuted falling thirty feet and getting smacked on the head by barbell not only is home alone unnecessary but it offensive it an exercise in tediousness and there isn genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end unless by some strange quirk of fate you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes and thus haven seen this stuff before can imagine anyone with reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure maybe that why the only ones laughing at the screening attended were still in their thumb sucking years
conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty five or thirty years after the item was made that when the kids of that time have jobs disposable income and desire to re visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you ll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks there heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work day world for long time they like to re capture some of that fun they remember from days of yore hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time and for the most part they re messing it up mission impossible lost in space godzilla zorro none of these successfully capture the originals none of these are even good films you can now add the avengers to the list the british television series began in 1961 super secret agent john steed then patrick macnee and his third partner emma peel then diana rigg are the pair that the american audience fell for surrealistic and witty the series fit the mood of the times the leather clad rigg probably didn hurt the ratings either after all it not coincidence that you can pronounce her character name without appeal now we re in the nineties steed now ralph fiennes and peel now uma thurman are battling evil genius sir august de wynter sean connery who is screwing with england weather that about as much of plot as we have there some footage about lot of other things that either don make sense or make even less sense we get betrayal for some unknown reason evil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason there high tech hot air balloon but have no idea why anyone in it the spy agency is run by man called mother who is in wheelchair and woman named father who is blind at least in some scenes there probably reason for all of this but we ll never know it macnee makes an appearance of sorts he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in scene that does nothing group of villains sits around table all clad in huge pastel colored teddy bear outfits at first it humorous to watch the teddies waddle around but then it becomes goofy the movie is medley of clutter confusion and wrong decisions around every corner it feels like major portions of the film are missing the storyline jumps rather than flows reportedly the film was re cut several times this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing there one good point where peel is running from one room to another in house designed by escher other than that the effects are second rate the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it doesn work she looks good dresses in all the right fetish outfits but there no spark fiennes fares even less well macnee steed was witty man of the world with sense of humor fiennes agent comes across as dour kid in grown up clothes who has never been out of his home town even connery one of the greatest living actors doesn have much of presence outside of few fiery scenes the action scenes are difficult to follow director jeremiah chechik responsible for the atrocious remake of diabolique somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldn be things happen people move around but even if with the utmost effort you were able to care about any of it the scenes are bewildering the primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were winning combination admittedly there are few humorous sexual puns in the film but there no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever one of emma peel first lines of dialog is rules are made to be broken it doesn get any better advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone the release date was changed several times connery refuses to promote the film there was no screening for critics which may have been good choice for warner brothers at least this way they get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out admittedly haven seen an episode of the television series for couple of decades my guess is that it would be severely dated now no matter how antiquated it might be there no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing there no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside watching this movie no reason at all
the following review encompasses two versions of dune dune the theatrical version 1984 runtime 137 minutes capsule review cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives the theatrical version of dune is spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book the film visual splendour mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative dune the extended version 1988 runtime 189 minutes capsule review bit of throw together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television it was disowned by director david lynch but it considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline quality dubs of this version from the out of print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web the review released in 1984 and made on then mammoth budget of $40 million the film of frank herbert cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci fi fans director david lynch mavi velvet eraserhead twin peaks was working on his biggest production to date mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico the screenplay was lynch own chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected dune is set in universe ruled by powerful families overseen by successive line of emperors the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis dune windswept desert planet that home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it most importantly it allows the navigators of the spacing guild once human but now hideously mutated to fold space and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish lynch film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story two main strands one is the long standing rivalry between two families houses atreides and house harkonnen and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long awaited by the natives of arrakis the fremen the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom unfortunately this epic story unfolds in confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended the thinking among universal oh so wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office with lynch initial cut running at closer to three or more hours the studio demanded that further cuts be made what great idea why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible the most glaring consequence of this one eyed stupidity is hopelessly jumpy narrative leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters thus their personalities are vague their motivations unclear and in the case of paul father duke leto their demise rather meaningless the end result is distinct chill we can warm to most of the cast and we don care much for them and it hardly helps that the voice over narration is sparse and that the dune esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book dune is also very serous film the constant self talk by various characters makes it so serious and self absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment the overall impression is world full of people so intense that no one is allowed joke lest the universe come crashing down around them humour or at least gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen mad sadistic kind is hard to find you may balk at the comparison but as writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus star wars trilogy the theatrical version is still some way from being complete disaster however it still possesses enough of lynch stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with taste for imaginative sci fi special effects whiz carlo rambaldi giant sandworms are an awesome sight both the production design anthony masters and costume design bob ringwood are striking and original and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis lush cinematography the film is at least feast for the senses see it in the widescreen format if you can and despite all the cuts several cast members still make strong impression most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam leader of the bene gesserit religious order who secret aim is to manipulate paul destiny for its own shadowy ends as paul atreides the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as credible leader of the fremen crusade the conclusion any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert original novel is complex piece of work and presents tough challenge for any filmmaker david lynch took brave stab at it and partly due to forces beyond his control ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects dune certainly confused and frustrated lot of people on its release many chose to stay away altogether as the film disastrous box office showing attests the extended version however is rather different beast in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition director cut of the film on home video clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres but alas he failed to do so choosing to move on to other projects in way then it is partly lynch own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa stung into action lynch successfully petitioned the director guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with allen smithee the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous judas booth certainly looking at the results of mca handiwork there at least half dozen instances that for sheer technical sloppiness are good enough reasons for the director to object but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration both of which fill many holes in the original version storyline paul relationship with his father and associates is more intimate with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously the political skulduggery involving the emperor the spacing guild the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained paul initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably and as further background new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us brief history of the dune universe as piece of storytelling then mca tv version of dune is clearly superior as piece of editing however it is at times surprisingly inept the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate there some sloppy cutting too and in few instances shots even appear out of order and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes eg ships coming and going soldiers coming and going is at times clearly out of context this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected and rightly so it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of television but the most notable omission is gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn even in herbert book the scene features baron harkonnen killing beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his heart plug its surreal and disturbing episode that very lynch esque but adds nothing to what we already know the baron is nasty piece of work despite its own peculiar flaws then the extended version of dune is generally superior film all up it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered fabricated or newly created sequences unless the idiosyncratic lynch has sudden change of heart the alan smithee version remains the closest we ll get to what the movie should have been on repeated viewings one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit still as one of this century great science fiction novels some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved better fate in its transfer to the screen with rumours circulating of new six hour mini series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga
in 1970s many european intellectuals especially those on the left political hemisphere became obsessed with the rise of fascism which wasn so hard to expect because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies in such times when political involvement could be associated with noble passion many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre war europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany of course there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other less noble reasons for them moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era which naturally made some of those films very popular among teen audience one of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass who later made career shooting expensive stylish soft porn salon kitty his 1976 film is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2 in 1939 walter schellenberg one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats none of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents and that all the rooms happened to be bugged the most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty nominal madame of the brothel didn know the real purpose of that enterprise screenplay by tinto brass of course simplifies the story and changes few names schellenberg is now wallenberg helmut berger ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top kitty kellerman ingrid thulin apart from being madam has second job as cabaret singer caught in the net of depravity is sweet innocent girl margerithe theresa ann savoy thrown into brothel there she falls in love with customer hans reiter bekim fehmiu disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe when margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel she finds out that the place is bugged she informs the madam of the real situation and both women decide to confront wallenberg those who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation but although salon kitty doesn happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn although not very successful some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict this time between power hungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty unfortunately brass seems to overuse other cinematical references probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino visconti the damned but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulin unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minelli musical numbers from cabaret all in all salon kitty is failure although with some very interesting moments
dr dolittle 20th century fox running time hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor 1996 murphy returns in this abysmal comedy he plays doctor john dolittle who as child had the ability to understand animals however after being exorcised he loses this ability and we fast forward to see dolittle in crummy job surrounding by crummy people most notably dr mark weller played by oliver platt however with bonk on the head his ability to understand animals returns and comedy is ready and waiting to happen except comedy never does happen doctor dolittle even with the excellent premise rarely manages to raise laugh poor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout the whole movie and his performance suffers the manic murphy we saw in the 80 is gone his more mature and more boring twin appears to be getting all the work in the 90 the voices of the animals which include albert brooks chris rock the new eddie murphy and norm mcdonald as lucky the dog are marginally better and at least they put enthusiasm in the movie sadly most of their lines are pretty dumb and they re not funny dumb like dumb dumber 1994 but just boring dumb the film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through in desperate attempt to raise some laughs there are few good jokes in the script but they are few and far between if had to choose favourite performance it would probably be albert brooks tiger who has certain charm about him sadly he barely in the movie and rock really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time joke wise we are thankfully spared the mocking and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor the director betty thomas has well done better films she bought us private parts 1997 and the brady bunch movie 1995 which were sadly much better than this the scenes lack any charm she just gets the job done the animals themselves are reasonable realistic although most of them are obviously puppets there an impressive looking tiger however and the lip sync is pretty good you have no problem guessing that most of the close up are puppets however with their jilted movement was hoping jim hensons workshop who created the furry friends would have done better job doctor dolittle in the end is disappointment for everyone involved murphy has done much better movies trading places the director has seen better days and even the creatures aren that good the target audience aged between 13 who are undemanding will probably like it however thanks to it dumbed down humour everyone else however should give doctor dolittle miss
the general daughter is heartless absurd film movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham handed obscenity creating film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo depth what worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching dark conclusion in sudden rain storm john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess playing warrant officer paul brenner brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell leslie stefanson daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell brenner is teamed up with ex spouse sarah sunderland madeline stowe and they check out all the suspects on the base including elizabeth mentor colonel moore james woods soon it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff but the question comes down to why and of course who ebert law of the economy of characters can be applied here one interesting thing noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point including the two protagonists but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story perhaps should have issued spoiler alert before mentioning that but it painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something on story level the general daughter is ineptly constructed the film adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille novel which was apparently based on true story plods along to its conclusion filling in the blanks with stale unrealistic dialogue and shocking plot developments having not read the novel it difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author but suppose they all are guilty to some degree scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity minutes after finding the dead young woman brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue which includes endless strings of forced lines sunderland actually asks brenner why was she killed to which would have answered if knew then the movie would already be over only after we ve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have sordid history together this angle though apparently present to develop their characters is never explored not that it really matters since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot in one scene sunderland is attacked by man in mask she sees one of his rings and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring instead of questioning him like as they would real suspect they take him to brenner houseboat beat him up and pour hot coffee in his lap this scene really pushed me over the edge not because it gratuitous and mean spirited but because it illustrates the film complete disregard for the characters and the audience it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene mostly because nothing they do comes as surprise realized that these constructs on screen aren actually characters but devices present only to serve the story this would have been bad enough without the west need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct compelling films about sexual crimes don spend lot of time on rape flashbacks and they certainly don show as much skin and sweat as typical pornographic picture these scenes are not the least bit powerful on the contrary they re intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain whomever that may turn out to be in addition the movie treats sexual fetishes and sadomasochism in particular as if it perversion of everything we know to be pure this standpoint is certainly allowed but only in accompaniment with well developed themes to back it up as it is the film forgets that lot of people have sexual fetishes and that putting on pair of handcuffs does not make person insane perhaps the only positive elements in the general daughter are couple of the performances james woods has few terrific scenes and plays his role with sharp witty subtlety also liked james cromwell mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous nonetheless these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization the general daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film it pretends to have soul to be of strict moral code when in fact it has nothing more than group of cardboard cut outs force feeding the audience toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one sided moral judgments
disney air bud tells boy and his dog story with twist the pooch is quite an accomplished basketball player granted for family comedy it not very funny or successful idea to begin with but it doesn seem to matter air bud is surprisingly solemn save for occasional moments of forced slapstick the movie wags its tale with straight face not very enjoyable approach if air bud had realized its own absurdity then it possibly could have been better here we re actually asked to cheer moment when the dog marches out to save the big game clad in two pairs of sneakers and even jersey its number k9 yeah whatever the movie opens as golden retriever buddy as himself escapes from his current owner abusive clown for hire norm snively michael jeter he ends up in fernwell washington where mopey new kid on the block josh kevin zegers is trying to cope with the move and the recent death of his father buddy kevin kevin buddy once the dog proves his on court prowess kevin self esteem rockets they both win places in the school basketball team with the animal as their mascot but before they can make it to the finals snively surfaces to reclaim buddy everything plays out just as one would think heavy on predictability light on an actual story the movie follows calculated chain of events kevin gloom fades snively gets his comeuppance and buddy contracts rabies and must be executed old yeller style okay that last one lie but at least it would have been quicker send off than air bud courtroom climax no joke there even faux cute musical montage where reluctant buddy gets cleaned up to splish splash paint cans are spilled and newspapers are buried all in the name of formula the end credits note that no special visual effects were used in the basketball sequences of this motion picture that very well may be true and although to see dog sink shots is quite sight movie cannot exist on feat alone but air bud doesn seem to be interested in anything else friend of mine insists he saw buddy while back on segment of david letterman stupid pet tricks can think of more appropriate connection this movie is stupid pet trick
few months before the release of star wars episode the phantom menace 20th century fox decides to release another space film that is complete rip off of star wars what is the point of this do not know but wish it hadn been done considering wing commander is definitely the year worst film so far to attract people to this horrible movie they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace wing commander will draw large crowds because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience had tonight many people do not know that wing commander is based on star wars computer game found this very interesting considering this fact almost says that wing commander is star wars movie it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though freddie prinze jr stars in the film as christopher blair wing commander was huge mistake for freddie this was definitely his worst performance to date after january she all that actually saw good actor in freddie but now all those visions have been crushed for now anyway christopher blair is pilot who is part of the battle to stop the kilrathi group that is trying to destroy the earth blair parents also fought in the space battles and also died there his parents were pilgrims so many people disrespect him because of this blair is under the command of angel played by saffron burrows and he is friends with another pilot todd maniac marshall played by matthew lillard matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie and he does in this one too his character as stu in 1996 scream a+ was great one but now it seems like that same role is being played again only in space movie the three are just small part of large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth this plot is very flimsy and doesn give whole lot to work with at all this explains why wing commander drags on seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on the acting is horrible in wing commander many lines seem out of place and are completely meaningless the acting and dialogue was so terrible even found myself laughing at it the other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music the special effects are very unrealistic when looking at two ships flying side by side it is simple to tell they are hanging and mavi screen is behind them the explosions look very unrealistic as well ship will be blown up but there will only be fire present four about one half of second this is very unrealistic music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time the music also felt like video game music and it was very corny and annoying sounding after we are given the plot the film repeats itself for another hour without any plot twists interesting scenes or anything important to the film blair is forced to make jumps over other planets and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft for the entire length of the movie it takes place in space it is truly like you are in video game because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for long extended period of time it not much fun to watch at all if wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships would go watch star wars at home at least star wars pays attention to people myth feelings and has some real plot to it the bottom line bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox

bruce willis needs to stay away from straightforward action pictures mercury rising adds to growing list including such stinkers as the jackal last man standing striking distance and the last boy scout of stale actioners he has headlined and though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix it is every bit as stale art jeffries bruce willis is your typical tormented fbi agent you know the type haunted by his job yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him slap on the wrist enter simon miko hughes an autistic boy who like rain man and all other autistic people is savant he can merely gaze at super encrypted message and while little computer beeps go off in his head he can understand what it says naturally this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government lt col nicholas kudrow alec baldwin an nsa official bubbling over with evil has spent countless time and money implementing the newest unbreakable code mercury however when two of his underlings robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman publish mercury encrypted message in puzzle magazine as final test of its effectiveness simon cracks the code naturally this infuriates kudrow who sends terminator like hitman ginter to eliminate the security hazard and that where art jeffries comes in for some reason that never explained in the film the fbi is called in to help and through series of intricate machinations art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy in few unrealistic sequences he enlists the aid of stranger stacey kim dickens to help out but she is given very little to do overall the central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous why bother trying to kill the kid mean who would know it not like the kid or anyone else for that matter knew he was cracking government super cypher and even if he is eliminated what does that help he already proven that mercury can be broken there always the chance that someone else would crack it but guess without kid in jeopardy there not much of movie here for all its faults the film actually starts relatively well once you pass the painfully familiar teaser the film flirts with developing real characters and semblance of plot then mr terminator the hitman appears and everything begins going downhill quickly miko hughes does decent job for his age at creating touching performance however don go to this film looking for any new insights into autism not that many people will instead he merely becomes the latest unique partner in routine buddy cop movie think cop and half with twist willis and baldwin are just overplaying to type rather than creating nuanced character baldwin simply oozes sliminess and for willis part he simply recycles the stock role of the loner cop fbi agent which he has honed in the die hard series as almost an afterthought about halfway through the film carelessly gives him character trait an addiction and then drops it in the next scene but the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay this film wasn well thought out at all the film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many convenient coincidences as possible the carbon paper scene alone is unworthy of the most gullible audience member at first the bad scenes just trickle in but by the gruesomely bad finale they re veritable flood the film few decent moments come in the form of bad jokes mainly from the geeks who developed the supercode but they re not nearly enough to make the film worthwhile mercury rising is thriller that you re more likely to groan at than cheer
capsule godawful comedy that amazingly shabby and cut rate and rather bereft of laughs was having bad week in my life when saw austin powers international man of mystery desperately needed something to cheer me up or at least distract me so could get clear head get some perspective even dumb movies can do that for me sometimes tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment but am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day won the lottery michael myers has taken character that would barely have supported five minute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of feature film padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of props strategically positioned between naked actors and camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago the plot what little there is of it back in the swinging mod hep sixties don think doing disservice to the movie attempted early look and feel by describing it that way sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr evil evil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later when powers was out of the picture powers also had himself frozen and he wakes up to find the nineties very hard time to deal with the basic gag that of powers total inability to cope with the nineties is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with the bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics james bond gags of which this movie has no end right down to the silly character names inept slapstick toilet humor and strategically placed props the movie amazingly bereft of ideas come to think of it with couple of bright exceptions one is dr evil son there is sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group chaired by carrie fisher and the other is throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind couch it visual gag hard to describe and hard to recommend seeing the movie for lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie but it desperate rather than clever instead of skewering the whole thing it rather bloodless and unfunny tribute myers himself is also desperate he given an idea to play not character plus the attempts to make the character work by giving him relationship with another sexy albeit nineties agent are waste of time wanted to have the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her only to have her deck him one with couple of exceptions the movie misses all of its own best moments the movie even looks cheesy and not in good way kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hi def video or something so grainy was the film stock in good many scenes the whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap my definition of comedy is simply did it make me laugh the few times that laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time spent cringing and wanting out the most damning thing could say about the movie is that wayne and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tyson shorts and sent it sailing
battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 and guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close in fact ll be surprised if see anything this bad in the next ten years based on the novel by scientology guru ron hubbard battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information it the year 3000 and an alien race called the psychlos which sounds like tag team of mexican wrestlers conquered our planet in nine minutes ok we are all of 10 seconds in and have zillion questions racing through my mind when were we conquered the audience is led to believe that this happened about 000 years earlier and if that is the case then we re going to get into whole bunch of problems later trust me keep reading also why don we get to see earth get conquered how the hell do you make popcorn sci fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film humans now live as cavemen or slave labor and for the film first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver colorado they grunt and groan and babble about monsters so when the psychlos conquered earth were the only humans not captured herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered whenever that was this is definitely not the way to start an action sci fi film one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is monster and he begins to fight it the monster turns out to be dinosaur from an old miniature golf course he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course with some shrubs growing over them so in 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time with only few weeds growing over it anyway some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl john travolta smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing recently discovered altin deposit the cavemen led by barry pepper are forced to do their bidding or whatever but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet or something so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 000 years earlier and we re supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by group of buffoonish aliens who can even handle few cavemen one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos so jets left unattended for 000 years are still able to fly please if leave my car unattended for two weeks have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway shouldn they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us the psychlos refer to humans as man animals but yet dogs are still dogs why aren they dog animals the psychlos are after mining earth precious resources but for 000 years are unaware of fort knox why do even care at this point fan of travolta and glad to see he back on the list in hollywood despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon but how did he possibly think this was good movie and how did he think he was giving good performance here he more than capable of making menacing villain see broken arrow and face off but whenever his character came on screen couldn hold back my laughter now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have travolta just looks like travolta all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face but travolta just has goatee also travolta acts with sort of phony upper class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world ooooo scary villain as producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better you can make dumb but good sci fi film love independence day for example but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth did everything possibly could to stay awake during the screening cleaned my glasses walked around the theater made grocery list chose my lottery numbers for the week replayed super bowl xxv in my head with commercials and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids by the time we actually reach the year 3000 people should still be avoiding this film folks save your cash don go see it don rent it and don buy it you be more entertained by taking the money you use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind watching it sail away hell send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal we ll entertain you plenty with that kind of money unless of course you re just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running which is just about all you ll come away with from this movie that and headache [editor note for some reason though the day after my screening converted to scientology not sure why something just made me feel compelled make the choice
jet li busted onto the american action movie scene when he stole the show in 1998 lethal weapon with his wicked looks his nasty moves and his undeniable charisma it only took another two years for mega producer joel silver to set him up in an all american movie primed to take over some of the empty action hero seats left by alleged coke head van damme and that pudgy guy named steven seagal would this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts namely chow yun fat and jackie chan let find out plot rival chinese and siyah gangster organizations fall further out of favor from one another when members of their respective families start turning up dead that when badass jet li blasts into the picture to find out who the men were behind his brother death and to exact some of his own style of revenge critique three words not enough action simple enough not enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for horribly predictable screenplay bad actors crappy dialogue and oh so many over the top melodramatic moments and romance angle why one must ask why love fight scenes and really dig jet li too but this little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences and jet well the poor dude was barely in the movie and thought this was supposed to be his big break how bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his kung fu fighting chops slap him in few more scenes and give him more chances to practice his acting english abilities what letdown even siyah mask was more entertaining than this glossed up empty shell of film in fact am sure that more time was spent gathering the hits for the soundtrack of this film than were on the so called screenplay felt like was watching soundtrack rather than movie most of the time the sad part about the bad script is that it wouldn matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines but no save lindo and aaliyah who weren too shabby thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their inability to deliver lines convincingly and what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deal run by some 15 year old looking guy acting like he the overlord of drug ring what mess then again don want it to seem like complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway not the story well guess that what disappointed me the most out of this film there were couple of cool fight scenes with li but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving also as much as love the way they incorporate wires and special effects in some of their stunts couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too obvious stunt it should be seamless fellas not necessarily against the laws of gravity the one cool thing that was original in the movie was the way in which the director showed us some of the inside cracklings of the human body when penetrated by blow but that simple creative touch couldn save the rest of this film uninteresting plot movements disappointed for jet li that this film didn give him the real opportunity to star in good story with many great action scenes hopefully the next time will be charm for this charismatic actor for now just hope that for his sake the film title isn premonition of the movie ultimate fate at the box office
one night during torrential downpour that flooded the streets we went to see what else hard rain so are we all going to die the sheriff randy quaid asks in the story opening line as he evacuates his flooded town the answer is pretty much yes but not nearly soon enough and to add insult to injury the supposedly dead regretfully often turn out not to be so populating this bad tv movie of the week material are host of talented actors one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water they will all receive siyah marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie graham yost script serves up one cliche after another for the actors who thankfully managed to mumble quite few of the lines director mikael salomon staging is so confusing that you may have trouble figuring out what is happening the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies jr dark and ugly cinematography the plot concerns an armored car that gets stuck in the raging water onboard are guards tom and his uncle charlie christian slater who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart plays tom edward asner drops by briefly to take on the role of the soon to be dead charlie coming to their rescue is gang headed by jim played on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman he views the loot three million dollars worth as his retirement plan the entire movie is one big watery chase with the sheriff and his posse tracking jim and his gang who are in turn after tom along the way tom picks up love interest in the person of crucifix weapon wielding woman named karen played in totally wasted performance by minnie driver the action sequences are repetitive and without much interest they do feature lots of explosions and gunfire to keep you awake christopher young emotionless score for the film has single trait ear shattering loudness the plot holes are as big as the ones in the dam that breaks submerging the town the characters have an infinite number of bullets and rarely do they have to bother reloading their guns the weapons and the ammunition spend most of the time under water or being rained on but always fire perfectly when one of the bad guys drops gun into the water it stays in the same place until much later when tom swims to get it even though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees counting these improbabilities is one of the more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait for the characters to kill each other the show has single but unprintable good line betty beyaz plays an incessantly bossy wife and when her hen pecked husband finally told her off our audience roared with laughter the show concludes with sickening set of twists the best that can be said of the picture is that it is merely stupefyingly awful as opposed to laughably bad hard rain runs 37 it is rated for violence and would be fine for teenagers the two families behind us shockingly had half dozen preschoolers among them
it was with huge lack of something to do that decided to watch this on good old upn on sunday afternoon when the only good things on tv are the second rate movies they show some are good they showed total recall before this one if you know me think seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live and this includes keanu reeves what do hate about seagal hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening and non threatening situation the squint hate those scenes in every movie where he goes around bullying people up saying stupid lines with brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynold hairpiece in boogie nights despise how he never gets bruise in any of his fights hate how every single plot twist leads to just melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain hate his non satirical messages in the beginning of this one he slaps on quote from arthur miller which has nothing to do with the film except it about brooklyn where this film takes place and hate how he so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing during the end credits he has good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him sure the guy probably nice guy in person actually found him very non threatening when he was on letterman not too long ago but the guy makes worse films than reagan did so what the plot of this shit terpiece well something about him trying to catch stupid ass crook william forsythe who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight couldn believe how bad this scene was the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect ahem and forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off sorry did anyone ever hear of concealing one self so in comes ex brooklynite seagal who dedicates his life to catching this guy and just wished he had caught him in the beginning then ended the film but noooo this drags on as he bullies forsythe family members including stupid bar owner and none other than gina gershon as his other bar owner sister and forsythe more than once threatens his family at one point he actually comes to their house and stalks them like non threatening nicholson in the shining complete with them all hiding in the bathroom but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away seagal paints himself as lovable person with son and fiancee he even shows him hanging with his son checking up on his homework and then about to take him out for bit of catch when he conveniently called away on assignment dunno about you but playing catch with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares he also shows him as that bad ass he wants to be with scenes of him bullying crooks around and taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after he unarmed chinese guy swinging bats with pool cue serves them right this film as some of his do has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented but don appear to be in this film already mentioned gina gershon who pretty horrible in this one as well as william forsythe who over acts terribly know this guy can act he was awesome in raising arizona as goodman partner in crime but he just awful here jerry orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down why is he the only one who gives good performance well because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility he seems to be in here just to give it cool law and order feeling even if it not cool feeling and in cameos are rated erotic thriller cinemax style stars shannon whirry as terry malloy which is more of bad joke than clever one and athena massey oh and er julliana margiulles has two scenes out for justice just proves once again that american action films just suck know that there such good thing as good action he called john woo but if you re in the mood for some good old no brainer fun yet dumb action don bother watching this it so stupid that it boring
vampires starts out almost in the style of spaghetti western with an attack on small homestead in new mexico the house has nest of vampires and jack crow james woods is leading team of vampire hunters in to clean them out while the initial imagery is little over dramatic it gives way to what is fairly decent action sequence that is enough action to last us while and we could director john carpenter would let us get to story line but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene then there is only bit more of plot before the next action scene after that the plot is kept to minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end and that is something of pity because the film based on the book vampire$ by john steakley gives us myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it what carpenter saves his serious screen time for sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires there is lot of fighting and lots of gore anything intriguing is kept to minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans this has not always been carpenter style his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do little thinking about the film central science fictional question jack crow heads vampire swat team cleaning up nests of vampires with high tech spears and crossbows in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by particularly mean vampire valek thomas ian griffith who has been tipped off to who crow is now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya daniel baldwin to make matters worse he does not know the people on his own side tony and his backers he can trust meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico if this is sounding like very tired police corruption plot with few obvious substitutions that exactly what it is the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for gang of hood who are themselves looking for packet of heroin but carpenter goes against familiar principle of film show people don tell them just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding why are the vampires in new mexico what do they want and why do they want it what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church how did crow come to be vampire hunter and why devote his life to it the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized but instead are revealed through dialog now if all this was not bad enough carpenter misuses the james wood persona woods plays particular sort of cool lowlife very well but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio leone style mythic posturing while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target woods does not work as larger than life mythic hero that is not his style and it just does not work very well there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses in one scene we are looking at motel room with dead people on the floor one female corpse is on the floor in front of chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret these vampires do not maintain low profile there are arguably logical flaws in the film there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has dramatic effect on vampires yet in scene toward the end vampire can walk under burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out while might recommend this film to an action audience would say that what look for in vampire film vampires rates on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale perhaps will read the book
when considering david fincher latest film the game four words come to mind don believe the hype this michael douglas vehicle from the director of seven isn nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe the film draws us in with an intriguing concept aided no doubt by the riveting trailer where jaded millionaire douglas is presented with the opportunity to enter into living fantasy this isn simply virtual reality this is real life with deadly twist on his 48th birthday nicholas van orton douglas is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother conrad sean penn conrad has special birthday present for his brother he hands nicholas gift certificate and tells him to contact company called consumer recreation services they make your life fun conrad tells him nicholas humors his brother telling him he ll call but it clear he has no time for any foolish fantasy role playing as he calls it then for reasons that are never really made clear nicholas decides to go to crs and see what they re all about he ends up spending whole day going through their screening process which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have nevertheless when it seems nicholas has been rejected as crs client the weird things start happening of course when we ve only covered about 30 minutes of screen time what else should we expect douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands one of those films basic instinct came from the creative minds of writer joe eszterhas and director paul verhoeven the premise of the game is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film total recall in that case the premise was implanting someone else memories as way to enhance one own life through dream vacation yet in both films the real goal is to create vicarious bond with the audience we live the adventure along with the protagonist reacting to each twist and turn in theory the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isn all we can do is hang on until the end of the ride when the truth is finally revealed now for those of you who forgot let me say this again don believe the hype the game is not thrilling roller coaster ride as suspense thriller it doesn do much but spin in circles by the third reel was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as endured the predictable plot is it any wonder douglas won be able to resist the charms of mysterious potentially life threatening blonde ever heard of glenn close no well how about sharon stone thought so if anything in this film surprises you at all would guess you haven seen that many films there is no suspense here trust me looked hard to find some had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations fincher aim for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas there are those that might say the game is not intended to be viewed literally would submit that is exactly the way tried to view the film the film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues there is moment early in the film where van orton realizing his game has begun smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who in on the whole thing he is charged by his paranoia he is looking at the world through new eyes it is the last thought provoking moment in the film from there on the director only wants to stay step ahead of us any significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into plot device at the outset we re told each game is tailored to the individual ultimately this game is supposed to work like crucible trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire proving his soul yet as douglas endures his personal gauntlet we re given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is wanted to like this film more than did look at it as just anothergreat idea poorly realized can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didn mean we were seeing what was really happening bryan singer the usual suspects for one film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas also there is the underrated jacob ladder with tim robbins film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism here are two examples of films that don simply manipulate for manipulations sake there are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to meaningful place one major issue that comes up in the game is whether or not the whole illusion is just highly sophisticated con game well can tell you right now after you ve spent your $7 dollars you may be asking yourself the same thing
weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg reliance on formulas _saving private ryan_ is mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches there ought to be law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics spielberg greatest strength as director is the polished formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make perfect story but for topic of such weight as combat in the second world war or the holocaust this technique backfires for it creates coherent comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films _saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on pr mission to pull young man ryan whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere out of combat on the normandy front just after day ryan is paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france there no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making great war movie the equipment uniforms and weapons are superbly done the opening sequence in which captain miller tom hanks leads his men onto omaha beach is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers the banality of death in combat the routine foul ups in the execution of the war and the cynicism of the troops the technical side of the film is peerless as always the camera work is magnificent the pacing perfect the sets convincing the directing without flaw hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance which was utterly convincing and the supporting cast was excellent though ted danson seems mite out of place as paratroop colonel yet the attempt at realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film or the story fails to convince throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices exception men are shown burning to death with relative frequency for example we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground here and there men lose limbs in one scene miller is pulling man to safety there an explosion and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half man but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact there are no shoes with only feet in them no limbs scattered everywhere no torsos without limbs no charred corpses and most importantly all corpses have heads in fairness there are smattering of wicked head wounds the relentless dehumanization of the war in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity is soft pedaled in the film ultimately _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war rather than saying _saving private ryan_ is realistic it would be better to describe it as having realistic moments another aspect of the hollywoodization of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular the lack of swearing anyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war such as fussell superb _wartime understanding and behavior in the second world war_ which has an extensive discussion on swearing knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup who is this private ryan that we have to die for him asks one infantrymen in the group of eight rendered in wartime demotic that should have been expressed as who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him or some variant thereof conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the word and largely about the search for food and sex this is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an rating due to violence so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it family film however the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg he cannot just cede control to the material he has to be bigger than it as if afraid to let the viewer find their own perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear emotional foothold in the material spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war meaning and coherence it never had the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler list the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close every bit as bad as schindler monologue about how his car tiepin or ring could have saved another jew quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson captain miller last words to private ryan and an unbelievable storyline in which prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain that particular subplot is so hokey so predictable it nigh on ruins the film nowhere in the film is there resolute depiction of the meaninglessness stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage because of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows
if you re going to make two hour hollywood in joke why bother releasing it to the general public if you re going to create film that will appeal primarily to big name actors and people who know woody allen then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters while watching celebrity realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating story about real people what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self deprecation celebrity is yet another film in which allen tells story about himself living in world that he familiar with dealing with people like the ones he actually knows allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more branagh plays lee simon journalist turned screenwriter who divorces his wife robin judy davis shacks up with some hot women famke janssen charlize theron winona ryder and goes about trying to get big stars melanie griffith leonardo dicaprio to read his script about an armored car robbery the usual elements of recent allen films are all here including the sexual insecurity of the main character lots of self loathing women and tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another unless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally it not likely that you ll find whole lot of interest in celebrity aside from all the in jokes the story falls far short of compelling and the characters are all empty and lifeless branagh proves once again that he superb performer nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly the problem is that he the same character allen always plays character who getting more than little dull to watch mean come on how many times have you seen this guy he hates his work and he can be satisfied by any one woman and at the end of the movie nothing has been solved he brings all of his problems upon himself crashing his car because he receiving fellatio and other such stunts so it pretty hard to care about him in addition isn allen capable of creating characters who aren just like him know he is but he didn do it in celebrity the vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances davis playing the same woman with low self esteem that she played in deconstructing harry has few touching moments but ends up the same despicable celebrity type that fills the rest of the movie some of the actresses are saved because of their beauty theron and ryder especially but they re not likable people only famke janssen as book editor interested in simon new novel has any life the men in the picture don do much better joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin while dicaprio as christian slater johnny depp type spoiled young actor is funny but disengaging what really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its themes are allen seems to think that he making an insightful movie about the way normal people look at celebrities the main problem with this is that the character with whom we re supposed to identify simon is not normal guy he just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters the other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us none of them register as realistic interesting characters they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue in addition allen decides he needs scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly robin in this scene says something like it interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate celebrity is arguably allen biggest misfire to date it does have few good scenes theron super orgasmic model character is kind of funny and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us character or two but celebrity is failure at the core unless allen point was to make self indulgent movie about himself and his friends if he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of big joke then he succeeded in that for one don enjoy feeling like an outsider
it used to be that not just anyone could become vampire usually you had to be an aristocrat count such as dracula or karnstein to qualify you have to have modicum of sophistication so you at least look cool or suave when biting into some young damsel throat but today in our overly politically correct world any scuzzy looking long haired unshaven lout or any spiked haired harridans can put the bite on you by the same token to be vampire hunter one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier or at least one who retired with honors not in these times all you need are some sharp weapons some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be buffy or blade without sounding elitist the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity which brings us to blade the latest in long line of vampire movies in which it seems half the population is putting the bite on the other half not only are there thousands of vampires but they seem to move from city to city pay off police departments and most importantly establish their own exclusive after hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in blood shower with all that blood you wonder why they have to hunt for victims you also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains blade which is based on marvel comic book character is like comic book all visual the plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader deacon frost it all hokum and nonsense of course but the filmmakers play it straight unfortunately at least at the advance screening attended the audience didn see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings you know movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter another tell tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero costume more than the hero also it seems it not enough for today vampire merely to have fangs he must also be proficient in the martial arts why supernatural being one of the undead needs such skills is beyond me of course this concept dates to the 1974 hammer films run run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires in which dracula is defeated by seven karate chopping siblings wesley snipes is buff as blade he growls his lines the few he has and spends most of the time glowering as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second thoughts about starring in and co producing this turkey blade is just another example of how the vampire film once honorable member of the horror family has gone downhill this dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling crucifix in his face today vampires lack the panache the style of bela lugosi or christopher lee they are not even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers capes they are more farcical than frightful this whole enterprise is one dull blade that could have used lots of sharpening
it seems that ve stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch take payback for example movie that most people seem to like however it horrible schlock straight out of hollywood vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies it was written and directed by guy who should have done better however maybe he did do better after all 30 percent of the movie isn his own mel gibson that hollywood zombie decided he didn like the ending and had another director reshoot it what crock if you sign on to do movie then do it the way the script calls for why film movie and then look at it later and say no changed my mind don like the ending you re fired let get someone else to do it suppose honor is dead in hollywood the end of the film is of course hollywoodized which is to say that it happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize in this case as is most victories in hollywood movies gibson prize is blond and money miss originality in film really do think audiences are so starved for it that they ll flop down lot of money in hopes that movie will be original payback tagline get ready to root for the bad guy promised an original idea but it was far from the truth while gibson character certainly broke the law he was character that had honor odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it wouldn kill in front of children and protects his blond woman there nothing bad about him he hollywood character person who could never exist in real life and gibson knows it he spends his time trying to act like bad guy and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant the story involves gibson being double crossed by his partner who is real bad guy which made me wish that we could root for him over $70 000 gibson recovers from multiple gunshots is pissed naturally and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back no more no less he makes point of it that it strictly 70 grand real bad guy would have made his ex partner pay 25% interest this idea is completely stretched out gibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with what didn understand this is the chicago mafia $70 000 is like spare change to them they probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him think they respect guy going through this much trouble for simple $70 000 maybe being too hard on the movie perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make simple popcorn movie read roger ebert review and he liked gibson in the role because he is comic at heart playing bad guy that why we re allowed to root for him and it true gibson walks the movie as if he smiling at joke he just heard but he wrong here wanted lee marvin or old time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn comic just an ass kicker as side note ve just checked the internet movie database and discovered that am the 38th person to post newsgroup review of payback after this many reviews why would anyone want to read this really don care just trying to gain membership into the on line film critics society by posting as many reviews as can
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned quick robin the anti shark repellant adam west in the 1966 batman feature film casually kicking at pathetic looking rubber shark attached to his leg had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness but in many instances batman and robin nears and at some point even exceeds this standard this is disasterously bad film easily the worst in the series to date and fairly epitomizes cinematic definition of the word excessive it loud garish and obnoxious with pointless gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill batman and robin features the caped crusaders george clooney debuting as batman with chris donnell returing as robin squaring off against another bevy of chemically induced villains the nefarious ice cold mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger armed with weapon which freezes everything in its sights and the slinky poison ivy uma thurman who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result but whatever and then dispatch them with poisoned kiss by ivy side is the giant steroid monster bane jeep swanson grunting hulk of beast the villains goals are noble ones freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees so that he can survive in order to devise cure for his beloved wife vendela dying of degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation and ivy intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth albeit by destroying all human life meanwhile on the homefront life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth michael gough and the arrival of his niece barbara alicia silverstone akiva goldsman screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad with astonishingly terrible dialogue lame jokes and an awful by the number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement it makes goldsman screenplay of batman forever which thought was dreadful look positively inspired in comparison am still astonished that cheesy plot device which seen used in no joke an episode of gilligan island somehow make its way into multimillion dollar blockbuster production joel schumacher direction of batman and robin is horrific with terrible balance of flashiness over substance there is clear conceit towards neon in this film even moreso than with his previous batman forever with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo just in case suppose if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly pointless fight sequence with bane and street gang over ivy chosen new abode another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons mr schumacher focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible to the detriment of the story there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all out camp and heartfelt drama with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film opening even before single line of dialogue had been uttered is batman and robin supposed to be campy think it is it hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted bomb each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be somehow doubt it the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn attempting to be the utter farce which it is arnold schwarzenegger is top billed in the film as the villainous mr freeze and is bland and uninteresting perhaps the worst thing that villain can be mr schwarzenegger attempts to be menacing are laughable and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable frankly everything he does onscreen is laughable by the end of the film was stifling chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen the bulk of his performance consists of uttering near unintelligble puns and one liners featuring every possible permutation of cool in the least inventive way george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin being overshadowed by the villains and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film his batman is hardly an imposing figure chris donnell is unimpressive in one note performance while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all the film one saving grace undoubtably uma thurman entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy her work in batman and robin is certainly over the top but in controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film ms thurman comic timing is impeccable and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully already starting to positively reassess jim carrey performance in batman forever her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film and when she offscreen the film greatly suffers figure that if one has to die being kissed to death by uma thurman isn half bad way to go while batman and robin was hardly ride of pulse pounding excitement must admit that was not bored watching it although did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one liner and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat it been long time since ve laughed so much at movie at of course is the operative word
everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap from the roger corman grade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek vi the undiscovered country but piller not quite half baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection failure about to give the same advice to rick berman and co as ve given to the financiers of james bond movies it time to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers and real director while we re at it put that visor back on laforge for three hundred years the ba ku species who look just like humans have lived on ringed planet that might as well be called the fountain of youth six hundred of them occupy the briar patch the area affected by metaphasic radition positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly but evil ru afo this is probably abraham last stop before performing amadeus at dinner theatre near you leader of the son who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery wants to relocate the ba ku and movie his people onto the briar patch in their place in order to replenish his dying breed the federation is all for this but picard feels this is direct violation of the prime directive to not interfere with the development of an alien race never mind that the ba ku didn exactly evolve they went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world every time frakes gives an interview lately he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment he has called it comedy thinking man picture throwback to the old series and most grievously he has likened it to john ford western presume that some john ford he went to school with not the director of the searchers he has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version that no excuse someone generated this footage muddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the least of its problems star trek insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia consider such curiosities picard love interest anij donna murphy can slow things down by staring at them such as waterfall or falling rocks her scientific explanation for this don ask worf gets pimple he re experiencing klingon puberty thanks to the time defying atmosphere laforge regains his eyesight trust me levar burton real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact and troi brags about her firm boobs but picard remains as bald as an android butt most suspiciously what exactly is the problem with letting this endangered race have little fun in the sun the filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsense about family feud of sorts and they also turn ru afo into completely power mad superfreak just so the characters will have something to do in the climax and if you ve seen return of the jedi you ve seen the ending of this movie didn picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions frakes lucked out with first contact and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection he has no sense of comic timing and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists take look at the painful troi gets drunk scene in fc and you ll get the general idea of insurrection unsuccessfully jokey and hollow tone even the worst shatner and co treks like the final frontier maintained watchability thanks to the effortless charming comaraderie between kirk spock and bones neither first contact nor insurrection has any idea what to do with crusher gates mcfadden whom must say maintains fabulous physique troi or laforge and all three next generation films spend too much time on data who is the franchise answer to urkel need cheap laugh have data say something sexual or start singing or lift up four hundred pound boulder as if it the hunk of styrofoam it really is here my proposed title for number 10 data star data trek data data data data data in this movie data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose while crusher and troi watch silently from 500 yards away and laforge points his sinister gaze at the android in doubly robotic observation star trek insurrection had one nice eerie silent moment that hints at better darker film not saying all of them should be star trek ii the wrath of khan but this one boldly went where no movie should go again
this is one of the worst big screen film experiences ve had for while with this film plus `showgirls and `basic instinct paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors his celebrated film `total recall was admit successfully scripted but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws obviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in production from someone like verhoeven the result being that much of the special effects in `starship seemed fake but not everything bad in the film was the director fault even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors it is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards expected five for the acting categories casserole vanity devoid dense ribald dingy miasma and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school no they have to pass primary school drama classes first while `total was written well `starship is purely pathetic all right it is supposed to be fast paced entertainment film and you re supposed to turn off your intellect completely and enjoy the action sequences and special effects that is guts and gore as matter of fact found the activity incredibly boring complete waste of more than two hours half of the film was bad episode of `beverly hills 90210 dina meyer was in beverly hills while another quarter was simply nothing things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web and the rest was display of humans fighting computer generated images the battles were all the same jumping around shoot or get stabbed and on barren planets that only had giant insects there weren even any stunts which consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around wonder what the insects eat if there nothing but them on the planets there is so much laughable treatment in this film and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended this type of story is obviously aimed at 10 year olds who can see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality but then there are always 16 year olds who have that frame of mind the pointless plot begins when johnny vanity devoid girlfriend carmen richards decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth johnny then signs up as trooper also after an overacted argument with his parents but there is another girl dizzy meyer who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen which results in love quadrangle which isn better because it means augmented worse than stereotyped soap opera increased bitchiness and more bad beverly hills melrose and the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid anyway getting back to the thing you might call plot johnny is too stupid to be pilot and has to join the infantry while his girl and the other dude are in the same league dizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also they then start training which contains what roger ebert calls ips idiot plot syndrome moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes then real combat and guess what that about as complex as it gets oh and one of their friends carl neil patrick harris doogie howser becomes involved in war intelligence and his abilities at the end are really corny and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it he my fifth nom for razzie the troopers fight fall in love die kill and try to act naturally they win or sort of half win of course in between and at the end there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs the bugs also suffer from ips why would you release hold of your captive before killing it isn it also amazing that earthlings haven invented better hand held weapons by then the only question that remains is why gave it one star instead of zero well maybe quarter of star for the originality of the co sex shower scene and the very brief moments of suspense another quarter for copying `zulu and letting the good guys the bugs win and half star for the sucking out of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors but there should have been more the troopers deserved to die
phew what mess for his fifth collaboration with director rich ard donner lethal weapon iii maverick mel gibson plays motormouth maybe mentally ill new york city cabbie jerry whose wild conspiracy theories are all but ignored by alice julia roberts acting all serious the justice department employee that he has crush on she not interested but another person is cia psychiatrist patrick stewart who promptly kidnaps him is one of jerry conjectures correct is the metal strip in the new $100 bill being used to track your movements is oliver stone still alive because he cut deal with george bush to spread dis information is this movie really about any of the crazed cabbie theories no no and no as it turns out there some other nonsense going on here involving and revolving around jerry background hint pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out and flashes back in quick succession to images of an interrogation room hypodermic needles and ms roberts herself the initial premise is pretty good and is played for while at delightfully dizzying clip mel is wider open that we ve ever seen him and if his character relationship with roberts initially strains credibility their combined star power is blissfully intoxicating the highest wattage of the summer perhaps even when the plot contrivances begin to intrude the two remain randy dandy screen pair there great scene in jerry fortress er apartment with alice trying to act casual as her hyperactive host tries to remember the combination to locked coffee bean container which he stores in another locked con tainer his fridge other hilarious moments of which there are many include trio of memorable convention breakers where alice ditches tail jerry cold cocks someone and later eludes foot pursuit each in uproariously unexpected fashion that donner own ladyhawke playing in the theater btw let see other pleasures include brilliant title sequence jazzy score from carter burwell and the worth paying to see sight of roberts pumping lead into one bad guy and slamming another head into wall oh pretty woman getting to the latter however requires slogging through an increasingly overburdened and ultimately unappealing story the last hour of conspiracy theory devolves from tolerable to torturous to almost unwatchable more stuff happens of the stupid shit variety than is worth mentioning here except perhaps for late sequence that has alice locating jerry in an abandoned wing of mental hospital by hearing his voice carrying through the air ducts and here thought it was wabbit season good god who rewrites these movies and do they arrive in nondescript siyah vehicles
in french the phrase film noir literally means siyah film webster defines it as type of crime film featuring cynical malevolent characters in sleazy setting and an ominous atmosphere that is conveyed by shadowy photography and foreboding background music classic film noir including such memorable fare as the big sleep the original cape fear and orson welles striking touch of evil employed siyah and beyaz photography to emphasize the long shadows associated with the genre color came into play with neo noir films like chinatown and blade runner confidential easily the best film of 1997 is wonderful piece of contemporary neo noir filmmaking for textbook example of how to take all the elements of neo noir and create an absolute mess there palmetto based on just another sucker short story written by british author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase palmetto shows what happens when filmmaker puts style ahead of substance director volker schlondorff tin drum the handmaid tale stated we weren even sure for long time if it was going to be thriller or comedy it shows palmetto is too preposterous too be taken seriously as thriller and too ponderous to work as comedy the story begins when journalist harry barber woody harrelson is released from prison someone turned state witness and revealed that harry was framed reward for blowing the lid on corruption in the small florida town of palmetto bitter and broke harry plans to hitchhike to miami and start his life over but ex girlfriend nina gina gershon appears to return him to palmetto while hanging out at bar he notices that beautiful woman has left her purse in phone booth harry pockets her cash only to have the woman reappear and catch him with her money in his pocket no problem though the radiant blonde is rhea malroux elisabeth shue the young wife of very rich older man with heart problems and she has proposition for harry rhea needs threatening voice and someone to collect the ransom for the staged kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter odette chloe sevigny the girls want to bilk half million dollar ransom from the old man and will happily give harry $50 000 for helping with the scam things go wrong of course odette is found dead leaving harry frantically trying to dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks in an ironic twist harry is asked to work for the local office they need press liaison to field questions about odette kidnapping and feel that harry is the perfect man for the job not bad set up for noir film if only schlondorff knew how to handle the material but he never settles on consistent tone the actors don know what to do with their characters either muddling the proceedings even further as if that wasn enough the story suffers from major problems in logic woody harrelson is talented actor with an admirable willingness to take on risky parts but he lost here presented as crusading journalist who was horribly wronged it makes no sense that harry would be stupid and dishonest enough to get caught up in this scheme harrelson clearly doesn know what to do with harry character so he spends most of the film glowering sweating and generally acting miserable meanwhile elisabeth shue gives goofy performance behaving like vamp on nitrous oxide as the stepdaughter chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks that she comes off like juliette lewis jr despite number of steamy scenes there no chemistry between harrelson and the women to make matters worse schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the character lips are running over each others bodies two particularly bad scenes highlight the film problems while driving with body in his trunk harry has minor car wreck and cop shows up the officer wants to help change harry flat tire and asks him to open the trunk harry pathetic attempts to keep the trunk closed might have worked if played as comedy but under schlondorff grim direction the scene is just embarrassing the film nadir comes when bad guy prepares to kill harry and nina we re supposed to be horrified watching our hero dangling over bathtub filled with acid but by this point the film has foundered so badly that the scene is merely reminiscent of when jessica and roger rabbit were suspended over vat of dip had palmetto been played with tongue firmly in cheek it might have been an entertaining shaggy dog story but under the harsh direction of schlondorff the film is just sluggish paint by numbers exercise in neo noir cluelessness avoid this nonsense and go see confidential instead
plot lara croft is british rich and kicks lot of ass she also likes to raid tombs but when the illuminata discover that all nine planets are about to stand in alignment for the first time in 5000 years and that lara holds the key to time well needless to say they want to nab it from her oh yeah lara also likes to sport lot of tight shirts hummana hummana hummana critique angelina jolie was great in this movie there were also about three action scenes that were pretty cool to look at in this film uhhhhhm unfortunately the rest of the movie sucked bad dialogue generic sidekicks and bad guys lame mystery yoda esque moments with mumbo jumbo being sprouted about and even some crappy cgi near the end all in all this movie wasn the horror show that some of the early reviews had warned us about especially since every other scene does feature jolie torpedoes begging to burst out of her lucky shirts but it was quite the letdown nonetheless especially when you consider the major opportunity that the filmmakers had here to create cool hip woman hero based on popular video game don know guess you have to put most of the blame on director simon west who didn really tie the whole movie together all that well the film lacked energy consistent pace and well fun time felt kinda depressed while watching this movie all that father crap was horrible and the dialogue given to poor john voight to recite was just plain embarrassing and not even gonna mention his moustache hehehe why have this shite in the movie at all especially hated the scenes in which some ghost like figure friend or child would ramble on about lara croft father while all the time not giving one ounce of crap as to what they re talking about guess that called lack of character development right that when movie builds enough background into the characters on the screen so that we could actually get into it and care about them didn care about anyone in this movie and was bored during most of its let explain why we re doing all this gobbledygook moments and even though thought that jolie kicked some mighty ass damn did she look sexy blasting those guns or what everybody else around her was so goddamn boring her butler was throwaway with no personality her side kick was supposed to be funny but just annoyed me every time he said the word bugger and he says it lot trust me and all of the so called bad guys just spewed one dimension they had no spark no energy amongst them and even though few of the action scenes in the movie were cool see the trailer and you ll know which ones talking about the overall picture was lame and the dialogue and mystical bull crap just buried it even further also for movie that supposed to be about all of these exotic locations wasn necessarily impressed by any of its exterior shots and even less so with its interiors which all looked like they were shot in the same room mind you won go as far as to say that it the worst movie of the year remember that actually have to go see freddie prinze jr movies also but it definitely the worst film that ve seen during this summer movie season of course it still early and sure there are few more garbage heaps coming down the pike skip this one altogether and rent any of the indiana jones movies instead trust me you ll miss the boobs but end your night with some rock solid porn and it all good where joblo coming from raiders of the lost ark 10 10 the mummy 10 lost in space 10 the mummy returns 10 the general daughter 10 romancing the stone 10 wild wild west 10 mission impossible 10
it happens every year the days get longer the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their big budget blockbusters this year crop already seems inferior to that of past summers even 1997 lackluster trio of batman robin the fifth element and the lost world the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla heeere lee zerd lee zerd which doesn make me optimistic about future summers godzilla is of course based on series of cult movies translation really bad movies only few people can tolerate from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner owned cable stations that this big budget remake won rise above its roots is fairly obvious the credits show us the origin of godzilla in five words nuclear explosion creates giant lizard sounds like an enquirer headline doesn it the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable discovery sequence this time japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling if that ain stereotype when he discovers the telltale radar blip people die cut to our protagonist played by matthew broderick he makes his first appearance wearing headphones warbling along to singin in the rain it none too subtle sign that he wishes he were in classier movie no dice bueller from the beginning poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla enormous footprint every disaster movie has to have know it all scientist and this time broderick is it as the world leading expert on radiated earthworms and wouldn you love to have that printed on your business card broderick is invaluable to the government he immediately dispels vicki lewis theory that godzilla is dinosaur because hey you can take seriously the intellectual arguments of newsradio cast members broderick instead hits the nail on the head announcing godzilla is radiated lizard the radiation isn an anamoly he announces and lightning strikes believe this is mutated abberation he continues and lightning strikes again it vocabulary lightning you see activated by words of four syllables or more meanwhile we re introduced to our new york cast headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist maria patillo broderick former love gee what are the odds their paths will cross again at dramatically important time poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she not ruthless enough nice doesn get you anywhere in this town it dog eat dog actually it lizard eat city as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin rampage on the big apple core the filmmakers provide us with one note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla think ve got bite he announces as gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him you can guess what happens next similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps one new yorker remarks please don tell me that another parade please don tell me that the best line you could come up with mayor ebert is not pleased played by the principal from head of the class he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option and bickers with his assistant gene guess the filmmakers knew they be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didn even bother to kiss ass the problem is if you re going to attack siskel and ebert you should at least make it funny dialogue like didn we agree that we weren going to have any sweets until after the election followed by back off gene just doesn work for me other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick character last name and frenchman jean reno inability to find good cup of coffee in new york there even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses as the beast heads back into hiding broderick suggests the military lure it out with food cue twelve dump trucks all dropping fish into new york intersection broderick that lot of fish that ambush fails but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying $50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them yep godzilla with children which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla that until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually like linda tripp godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day so it has lot of dumb action scenes destructive special effects and shallow subplots look no further than patillo betrayal of broderick patillo what have done animal what have become and the climactic godzilla nest sequence in madison square garden the main difference is independence day was about the experience it had real global patriotic element to it and some genuinely fun characters godzilla has lots of rain and lightning reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak blockbuster juicy fruit swatch sprint and bumble bee tuna yes bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie
heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in couple of interviews and in both instances he felt the strange compulsion to compare it little series of films called lethal weapon now personally remember those films as starring major motion picture star being funny having great action sequences great chemistry decent character development hmmm okay now on to my review of chill factor plot graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto malicious plan by an ex army general to propose nuclear device to international prospects when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps they must keep it cool on ice and rush it over to an army base before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit and kills millions of people critique speed on an ice cream truck is probably the pitch that was used to sell this one tone movie to its backers but unfortunately the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tension filled original two hours of cinema is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film and the lethal weapon movies stood for this film is seasoned in cliches with plenty of badly written dialogue over the top acting from cuba gooding jr zero chemistry between the two leads and horribly tacky bad guys tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe my friend and enjoyed watching this movie to certain extent because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously written that we just had to crack up that and the formula for the film script which followed the proverbial and you guessed it scenario and what about all those catchy hip names to get us to relate to the characters elvis and nighshift oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters and yes it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr got involved in this one week old blue cheese smelling project did they actually think that it would boost their careers or did they know that the script sucked but discounted any fall from grace knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall most probably the latter have you seen either fled or bulletproof well despite the slight differences in plot the essentials are basically the same here you get siyah guy and beyaz guy being chased by bunch of people having no choice but to work together to get somewhere hating each other at first but over time learning to respect one another as individuals yawn add to that the fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in siyah drive siyah cars and siyah vans and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head not too conspicuous eh call me party pooper but as much as like nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy this film just doesn even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining one cool scene with boat careening down mountainside and another with nuclear device obliterating everything on an island do not fun buddy action flick make show cuba the money everybody little known facts about this film and its stars this is not little known fact or anything but damn is it just me or does skeet ulrich look an awful lot like great looking actor johnny depp skeet real life nicknames include chester skeeter and mosquito he stands was born in north carolina and got married in 1997 to that sex kitten actress from clay pigeons 10 georgina cates they own farm together in virginia and seven dogs skeet has long scar on his chest from open heart surgery done when he was 10 to correct ventricle defect actor cuba gooding jr was born in the bronx new york in 1984 he break danced during the closing ceremonies of the olympic games in los angeles he stands 10 actress hudson leick who plays one of the bad guys girls in his movie is better known from her role as callisto on the popular tv series xena princess warrior this film reportedly had budget of $40 million not exactly sure where all this money went but it certainly did not register onscreen interestingly enough director hugh johnson who makes his big screen debut with this film was the cinematographer on the 1996 film beyaz squall and the 1997 demi moore vehicle jane 10
it is with some sad irony that screened fright night part on the day that one of it stars roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70 mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood having career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films fright night part probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us at least in the movies anyway it has been several years since charlie brewster ragsdale and movie actor turned late night horror film host peter vincent mcdowall came face to face with real live vampire who just happened to be charlie next door neighbor charlie and peter won that battle but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family apparently charlie former bloodsucking next door neighbor had sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling so she decides to exact little bit of revenge this ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again one of the things that made fright night such success was chris sarandon who played charlie stylish next door neighbor with taste for blood fright night part tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort while they are stylish the vamps in this film just don have the personality of the undead in the first film with the exception of werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to few of the scenes one bright spot speaking from strictly sexist point of view is traci lin who plays charlie very skeptical girlfriend it really shame that her career hasn been better since she made this film ragsdale does fair job in this film but doesn give nearly the performance that he did in the original roddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given which unfortunately isn much which is shame because his character was lot of fun in the original movie guess would have to say that the first film was superior product in every way the original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner part had more of the feel of music video never good thing for horror film another minus for part was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of shadow where very rare for that matter they were almost nonexistent if was going to watch horror film this would be far from my first choice the first fright night on the other hand would be right up near the top of my list if was in the mood for roddy mcdowall film probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes either way fright night part would most likely not enter into the equation
sometimes stellar cast can compensate for lot of things and pushing tin certainly features some name stars who are going places billy bob thornton cate blanchett angelina jolie and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first but he actually the veteran among this quartet of fine looking people sometimes terrific cast like this can compensate for lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has hip comedy written all over it compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits compensate for clich characterizations compensate for embarrassing you have to be joking situations etc in pushing tin thornton blanchett jolie and cusack don have an earthly from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble squiggly quirky credits fake looking passenger planes circling new york and anne dudley in your ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for the full monty let alone won it but for one wasn ready to walk just yet so quickly we descend into tightly edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have difficult job yes what with their frantic mile minute instructional personas juggling planes and passenger lives like some huge real mid air video game hip cool demonic auctioneer nick the zone falzone cusack is the best in the biz of course until some hipper cooler leather clad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell thornton shows up to challenge falzone finite air space boys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding then the macho one upmanship begins it doesn stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within cat whisker of each other oh no there are some broken hoop dreams some wanna see how fast can drives and then the ultimate showdown was that my wife saw you with last night director mike newell four weddings and funeral must have read different draft of this script because the one that being acted out up there between newark jfk and la guardia doesn have an ounce of subtlety and newell has made some awfully good and funny movies before the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe they ll make you frown in disbelief they ll have you constantly looking at your watch but wait there still 100 minutes to go the film only saving grace is blanchett whose connie falzone is spunky brash long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes this is wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played red headed australian gambler oscar and lucinda and tempestuous british monarch elizabeth but she not enough to save the picture thornton looks terrific and performs solidly but his character is joke jolie as russell knock em dead wife isn bad but the up and coming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like plaything cusack cracks gum dons shades and acts hip throughout but like everything else in the film his performance is forced in the last ten minutes or so for some inexplicable reason things start coming together and you begin to get sense of how this film might have been like the trailer teases but it too little too late fine cast aside pushing tin is nothing more than an embarrassment
the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film the world is not enough is its final frame beyaz letters on siyah background proclaiming james bond will return oh certainly hope not with pierce brosnan in his third and reportedly last go round as james bond 007 the world is not enough is the best example to date that enough is enough in this the 19th chapter in the seemingly endless franchise featuring ian fleming debonair british secret agent who likes his martinis and his nemeses shaken not stirred the sub inspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all of the setups stunts and sexy encounters of the previous 18 bond flicks rather than coming up with anything the slightest bit original we ve got previously used speedboat chases ski chases and sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines we ve got couple of hot to trot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them we ve got post cold war megalomaniac bent on world domination slash destruction here played by skinheaded robert carlyle with mean lean panache and as has been the case since 1977 the spy who loved me we ve got plot that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything conceived by mr fleming we ve also got main title song by garbage to which with very little effort you can fit the lyrics to both songs from tomorrow never dies while originality was never the series strong suit the films were almost always fun with at least some thought going into the nonstop stunts can think of one memorable set piece in the entire and very dull the world is not enough in addition michael apted yes the respected director of such films as coal miner daughter nell and the 28up documentary series takes embarrassing advantage of the full range of bond clich you get the talking killer plot device you know the scenario the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy yet waxes poetic just long enough to die of old age and you get slew of high priced assassins who can hit barn door at 20 paces in the film opening minutes of an endless 128 bond chases sultry sniper along the thames and the leather clad lovely fails to hit bond souped up fishing boat with bazooka when he pulls within few feet of her later she takes off in hot air balloon with bond dangling from guy rope beneath her but is still unable to take him out these reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual since there are no distractions other than occasional ads for luxury automobiles vodka or credit cards in and among the rampant product placements brosnan grapples with carlyle braveheart sophie marceau as former kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king she terrible wild things denise richards as nuclear physicist lord help me she laughable and judi dench as dame judi brings the only shred of dignity to series that has long since jettisoned its self respect about the time roger moore inherited bond walther ppk brosnan goes through the motions with the grace and charm you expect of the former remington steele star but even he has to be thinking there more to life than an easy paycheck he given plenty of wiseacre asides to deliver but only one of them don know any doctor jokes made me chuckle although thought christmas only comes once year is more in keeping with the series penchant for grown worthy puns
when walt disney pictures announced live action feature based on the 60s cartoon series of mr magoo special interests groups representing the vision impaired let out cry of dismay mr magoo they claimed would be an insult to the men and women they represented in fact they were wrong mr magoo is not just an insult to the blind and near blind it an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny 90 minute atrocity it stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases and you ll see shocking list of retreads including 101 dalmatians george of the jungle jungle2jungle that darn cat flubber and now mr magoo the best of these george of the jungle was mildly entertaining the worst mr magoo exposes just how painful bad movie experience can be the first problem with mr magoo is the script despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft mr magoo is comically barren from beginning to end there not laugh to be found every attempt at humor and there are lots of them falls flat with an audible thud you think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film at least few would work but that not the case ve had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures then there leslie nielsen who looks sounds and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character memorably voiced by jim backus in the past nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun lately however he has been getting lazy taking parts in the likes of dracula dead and loving it spy hard and mr magoo even if nielsen was in top form it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo especially since we re reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film but top form is not phrase would use to describe his performance here this is strictly take the money and run operation the story which like many disney stories can be described in one long sentence magoo is the only witness to the theft of rare jewel from museum and as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own the police mistake him for the robber the cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky who take their lumps early and often the bad guys are kelly lynch who does lot of martial arts type kicking nick chinlund and malcolm mcdowell who has the good sense to look embarrassed matt keeslar portrays one of magoo sidekicks his nephew waldo the bumbling man other more interesting companion is dog named angus most of mr magoo humor comes in the form of failed slapstick the cartoon violence level in this film doesn approach that of home alone or flubber but it still pretty acute with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices there non violent bit with magoo preparing chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better but compared to mr bean recent similar misadventure it doesn hold up well then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo near blindness such as the occasion when he mistakes wild animal for baby willing to cut director stanley tong little slack tong hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market has helmed several jackie chan movies including first strike rumble in the bronx and supercop his chief talent that of choreographing martial arts fights is wasted here despite some high kicking by kelly lynch like john woo hard target and ringo lam maximum risk before him it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream it is worth noting that unlike many disney films which hold perverse appeal for the under 10 crowd while driving parents to distraction mr magoo appears to bore viewers of all ages the screening attended was wall to wall kids and for the most part they didn seem to be enjoying themselves when the film was over asked one little girl what she thought of it her pained expression confirmed the adage that picture can indeed be worth thousand words mr magoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer sight unseen
sometimes wonder just what the censors are thinking take this film naked killer among it ingredients are heavy doses of violence rape sequences straight and lesbian sex scenes and what our system calls coarse language but what do those intelligent people at the censorship bureau choose to remove in case someone will get offended one word penis that it in spite of everything else in the movie the one thing that the censors decide is too much is penis it really restores you re faith in the system huh anyway that just side point when naked killer was released in the local independent cinemas around melbourne it was advertised ad nausuem as hip cool controversial thriller what they forgot to mention was that it isn very good the plot involves male cop tinam simon yam investigating series of brutal murders while getting haircut he meets and finds himself attracted to girl named kitty chingmy yau who after extracting revenge on the man who killed her father falls in with professional killer sister cindy svenwara madoka realising kitty has potential cindy decides to train kitty in several unusual and ridiculous ways and gives her new identity however in the course of his investigation tinam who believed kitty had disappeared runs into her again but isn quite sure if it her to complicate matters the actual serial killlers princess and baby who former students of cindy and have been told to kill their old master and her new student from then the action ensues all in all this is not well done movie the script is awful the direction all over the place the editing is jerky and confusing and the subtitling is surprisingly poor however the are few stand alone pieces that do entertain the shoot out in the car park is almost woo like in adrenaline the fight scenes are energetic and guess it must get few points for trying something little different let me put this way if you like action get something else if you like strong women in movies get something else if you have do decide between this and siyah cat for your hong kong female action don get either even for curiosity value it just isn worth it let face it if ever the was movie that became popular on it subject alone this is it
after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy was ready for some mindless fun oh maybe something like tango cash maybe not mindless fun is one thing but brain dead slop is another matter altogether tango cash has lowest common denominator written all over it the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in russell plays cash reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts stallone plays tango wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it he doesn need the money in an effort to change his image stallone goes for yuppie gq look in the film wearing spectacles and three piece suits the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names tango cash is unbearably noisy for starters there harold faltermeyer annoying synthesized score which gets old after four notes to make matters worse the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars the more the merrier in fact the movie begins with not one but two car chases there nothing like good old car chase to introduce the characters in movie screenwriter randy feldman brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it such as stallone efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual in movie with the iq level of an amoeba even great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent and stallone is no lawrence olivier it hard to imagine anyone reading feldman script and thinking want to be in this movie the film plot doesn have one original bone in its body and again you have to point your finger at the screenwriting feldman story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book making tango cash altogether generic and predictable they simply could have called it action movie every character every twist and turn is stolen from television or from other movies adding insult to injury tango cash is about as believable as road runner cartoon action movies don have to be realistic but they should absorb you enough so that you re not thinking about the lack of realism the only artistic aspect of tango cash is the cinematography there are some spectacular shots especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires the film main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell unfortunately their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants the dialogue consists of nothing but one liners and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing it shame because with workable screenplay russell and stallone could have turned tango cash into charming lethal weaponesque adventure tango cash tries to maintain light tone and you do laugh about once every five minutes seeing russell in drag is the movie funniest moment but you probably already have seen it in the commercials furthermore the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence machine guns and torture generally don mix well with comedy jack palance appears in tango cash doing what he does best playing sleazy conniving villain his character however is run of the mill except for his strange obsession with mice like many movie villains palance likes to play games in fact he sets ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room you have to wonder why palance doesn just shoot the detectives in the head the story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent teri hatcher plays stallone sister and russell love interest and she is just as pretty as can be but regrettably hatcher acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty every time she opens her mouth you cringe corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always fatal combination there really very little if anything to recommend in the film and more to the point tango definitely isn worth penny of your cash so don bother
in the 13th warrior arab poet ahmed ibn fahdlan antonio banderas finds himself kicked out of baghdad for feeling up the king old lady with his translator screen legend omar sharif in small role ahmed heads north to act as ambassador to the northmen vikings he finds group of warriors mourning the loss of their king messenger soon arrives from another kingdom requesting assistance soothsayer says that thirteen warriors must answer the summons twelve northmen and one outsider thus ahmed becomes the 13th warrior on the trip ahmed manages to learn the vikings language by listening to their fireside conversations bit far fetched it true but we have to swallow it if this flick is going to manage few lines of dialogue amidst the grunting ahmed who called ibn by the vikings forms friendships with herger the joyous dennis storh and the viking leader buliwyf vladimir kulich when they arrive in the other kingdom the thirteen warriors discover that they re facing an army of supernatural cannibals that live up in the caves hereafter most of the movie is battle scenes the cannibals attack the vikings the vikings attack the cannibals the cannibals attack the well you get the idea just to add some action there also viking vs viking duel other movies insert scenes between the fights these scenes are called character development suspect that the 13th warrior had better script at one time and that it fell through the cracks because of the tag team direction the movie started off in the hands of john mctiernan you ll notice lot of similarities between warrior and mctiernan predator including the chittering jungle sounds somewhere along the line mctiernan bailed and michael crichton took over crichton whose novel eaters of the dead is the basis for warrior has directed small assortment of goofy science fiction thrillers westworld coma looker runaway their result of their consecutive efforts is murky and pointless movie perhaps what the 13th warrior needs more than anything else is villain the eaters of the dead are faceless mob in blackface they have no personality and by the end they don even seem particularly threatening the audience has no target toward which to channel its aggression mctiernan should know about the importance of an interesting villain it was his die hard that made villains seem fun and attracted big name stars to the evil roles in action films the 13th warrior suffers from lack of vision it wants to be predator meets braveheart meets the magnificent seven meets dances with wolves with so many competing goals all it can do is echo what it might have been it might have been satisfying action film it might have been beautifully rendered medieval epic it might have been thought provoking examination of the meeting of cultures what shame it turned out to be nothing in particular bottom line if you want to see antonio swing his sword rent the mask of zorro
there isn much good about this movie not much can say about the acting directing or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie so ll get my one good comment out of the way at least joel schuemacher batman robin didn direct it or it would be titled technicolor city in fact there is nothing colorful about this movie its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end the plot has tendency to be interesting but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been fascinating movie the plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets so will just touch on the bare minimum john murdoch rufus sewell awakes in the bathtub of cheap hotel only to find out he has forgotten everything john must find out who he is before the strangers mind erasing aliens find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy during the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality and the existence of inherently evil people any of these points however are completely erased from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script as mentioned earlier nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film the acting is bland and since there is virtually no character development no one seems to care the special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake sign of true movie the direction is poor and there is little continuity not that you would expect it in movie switching realities constantly lastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality and doesn deserve to have the word science in science fiction if haven got my point across ll say it more plainly this is bad movie lets hope the next movie by alex wish was tim burton proyas is at least tolerable
varsity blues is the best film of 1999 thus far unfortunately it is also the first film have seen from 1999 it is another one of those small town sports movies that involves flawed but good heartedfrom 1999 it is another one of those small town sports movies that involves flawed but good hearted protagonist rough and meanspirited coach and the big game by the end will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph will everyone in the town turn against the coach will the team win the climactic game do cats bathe themselves regularly the so called hero in question is john moxin james van der beek senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team but is really just hoping to get scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead end town at least he got the right idea since west canaan texas is portrayed in the film as frankly pathetic with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming heck in one scene the front page of the town newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers big win the night before when the team star quarterback is severely injured tearing the ligaments in his leg john finds himself taking over as the team leader but his few minutes of glory do not last long as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend amy smart when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ali larter and after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at strip joint all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics the team loses their second to last game putting john at feuds with the coach jon voight who like gary oldman is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the bad guy worse yet the coach is threatening to ruin john scholarship chances if the badgers don win their final game the plotting of varsity blues is as old as the hills and contains every cliche in the book admittedly was never exactly bored while was watching it but hasten to add that was rarely ever entertained throughout all could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983 all the right moves one of the biggest problems had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were least of all certainly not john who played by van der beek of tv dawson creek is pretty much bore without any engaging qualities while probably shouldn blame this on van der beek since the inauspicious and by the numbers screenplay by peter iliff isn of any help he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in all the right moves the story revolving around john meanwhile is extemely thin throughout particularly for its 104 minute running time and it alternates between uninspired comic relief as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as stripper at the club and heavy handed melodrama the romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot but we also learned very little about her which is unfortunate since amy smart whom don think ve seen before in past films is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence smart does not allow her character to become the passive girlfriend instead coming off as young woman with her own ideas and opinions it too bad the camera didn linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts the adult characters probably fare the worse of any since they all must play residents of dim witted town that cares about nothing but football john relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance his father is set on him becoming football player at university but john doesn want any part of that his mother stands beside her big strong husband and is passive female finally jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one dimensional saving varsity blues from being total washout are few amusing sequences including one set in the sex education class which did get laugh out of me the scenes of playing football were well shot and thankfully didn overstay their welcome as many sports films fall victim to but leaving the theater the question had in my mind was why did this film need to be made seem to be asking this question quite lot lately since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood do we really need another high school sports film no we don and certainly not one of this low caliber which felt like cut and paste job of spare parts from much better but similar films varsity blues no doubt is the first one however to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts
for film touted as exploring relationships and siyah sexuality trois is surprisingly tame despite it lurid subject matter and it passing nod to fatal attraction it moves along with flat uninspired dialogue as it sets up surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film freshly moved to atlanta jermaine dourdan and his wife jasmine moore have the trappings of perfect life they have beautiful house in suburbia jermaine is lawyer on the fast track at his firm jasmine is his supportive wife who is finishing up her college degree in an opening montage via home video of the pair we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs this is couple that has it all into this eden slithers the lure of lust despite his outward appearance jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as possession than person glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business oblivious to jasmine concerns we also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in menage trois much to jasmine dismay as jermaine puts it don you want to be sexually free jermaine shares his desire with co worker terrence smith who obligingly sets jermaine up with woman who might be interested in just such an encounter the woman jade palmer is direct counterpoint to jasmine jade at one point was college student too unlike jasmine she found herself pregnant dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet to further reinforce their differences it revealed that jade is involved in custody battle over her son inevitably through liquor and touch of duplicity on jermaine part the forbidden act is consummated the aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaine property with the hint that the violence may escalate by this point trois shows itself to be soap opera without the requisite melodrama fatal attraction without the social significance the exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical jermaine comes off as insincere sexually driven and selfish jasmine is bland and subservient jade comes off bit sympathetically but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy yet another tale of sexually aggressive dog of man who imposes his will upon his accommodating innocent mate the last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you curve but by this point will you even care if the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending perhaps there could have been some freshness to it as it stands trois is pretty standard fare
my friend here in film school just made two minute long film for one of his classes that includes staged anal rape scene done by two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident with banana being used as the instrument of penetration as sick as this all is watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments ve ever witnessed sure it may be in bad taste but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest then there caligula this film features incest necrophilia beastuality anal rape homosexual felatio of both sexes elaborate and lengthy orgies greased up fist forced up man rear wine poured down man who had his urinary tracts tied off penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs etc etc etc this could very well be respectable film and if could have been had the following not occurred the events were graphically shot in clear view the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to well show historical accuracy the film was 20 million dollar production with lavish sets rather impressive cast and whopping hour running time produced and funded by none other than bob guccione owner of penthouse magazine caligula comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since plan from outer space because underneath there sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified but also brilliantly entertaining after all it not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry no film should be discarded because its content because film is never about what it about it about how it about as the old cliche goes those who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with caligula and that that it nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish without second of credibility in its mammoth running time caligula allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as blessing or so guess even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons the film opens on the wrong note of course with quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen using the over used passage what shall it profit man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer fucking around with his own sister in field suppose if one has to lose their soul one has to have soul in the first place the plot is so incomprehensibly done that all or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell performance that does the opposite that his performance in clockwork orange did is next in line for the throne but can wait for the current emporer tiberius peter toole ditto only for his performance in lawrence of arabia his grandfather to die so he kills him and ascends to the throne then he abuses his position marries woman helen mirren who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting so he doesn just have to sleep with his sister dreadful teresa ann savoy there to be pretty naked and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with abuses his position little more little more and little more and then believe invades england then is killed off the filler instead of recounting his life is supposed to be as guccione claims the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome complete with orgies vicious deaths and lots of nudity but instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be it instead becomes guccione twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like oh isn it great that they just loved having sex and that they killed people so disgustingly and wouldn it be great if could make couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it so blatantly real bad porn that ve completely convinced myself that it not mean why not just show roman orgy when can spend good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up and it not just that it disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film it that in film where the entire feel it going for isn felt it also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time the sets are lavish but so blatantly innacurate that wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this but that doesn matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if light meter was used at all making this not only dark and ugly but just plain dark the camera operation is also the worst ve ever seen in my entire life not only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them then have them out of focus the editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow there is no writer to speak of what the hell does it mean that it adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal but nevertheless the dialogue is shit so laughably bad that can in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over could say them with straight face my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius he could go at any moment but with care he could last year or so the music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian they use his gorgeous adagio of spartacus and phrygia ad nauseum used in an attempt to give the film some emotion but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere the orgy scenes and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo are the result of reshoots by guccione himself which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment every five seconds or so the film cuts to random nudity as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated john gielgud represents the only voice of sanity walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra going to kill my agent going to kill my agent and so on and so on for over hours making caligula about as exciting and enriching as three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying guccione in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made film that is such painstaking arduous task to watch in its entirety that doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage throughout the entire film the presence of guccione is easily felt as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen pretentiously looking down upon us saying look what can get away with and if you don like this then you re prig and worse than that you know nothing about history uh huh there clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that artistically good film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last that would probably make for good film but using historical accuracy as licence to get away with any kind of disgusting for disgustingness sake acts is total total bullshit and all can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism and have developed pathetic and sadistic taste for both judging from this film there film that came out in 1989 called the cook the thief his wife and her lover magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway also starring helen mirren which deals with graphic sex heartstopping violence and gore and even little cannibalism for good measure that film not only never patronized its viewers but also handled them in way that was shocking yes but also in bizarre way entertaining and totally involving there were real characters there in real situation and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that it going to be offensive to many that film achieved everything it wanted to do and has since retained status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good and it everything caligula might have been but alas wasn
america favorite homicidal plaything takes wicked wife in bride of chucky and their unholy matrimony is something old nothing new the burning question on the minds of most moviegoers however has nothing to do with nuptial specifics or even how the movie stacks up but rather whether or not the duo gets down and dirty on their blood soaked honeymoon the answer is sick and twisted yes and viewers are treated to shadowy glimpse of some hot enough to melt rubber or at least singe it lovin guess they re anatomically correct chucky again voiced by brad dourif of course is the star of the child play series my buddy type doll possessed by the spirit of slain serial killer in bride the plot heh picks up with his girlfriend tiffany jennifer tilly resurrecting chucky remains he was blown up at the end of child play with the help of siyah arts manual called voodoo for dummies silly mortal before long she also been reduced to shin high figurine status and the plastic incarnations of these one time lunatic lovebirds hit the road to scope out some potential new human bodies the rest of this rocky horror puppet show plays out as tiff and the chuckster stalk young couple nick stabile and katherine heigl with conjugal plans of their own leading them towards new jersey grave where magical soul transferring amulet allegedly lies in wait along the way our murderous barbie and ken go through post marriage motions similar to any given pair of newlyweds bicker argue kiss and make up but when they squabble over who going to do the dishes watch out hey even faux people have got to work through their problems director ronny yu keeps the mayhem flashy and stages an inventive scene or two but not even visual flair can make up for the fact that these creepy kewpies are neither scary nor menacing when one of them charges it nothing good forward punt couldn take care of and when climactic chase scene is needed one of the dim bulb protagonists must _pick_chucky_up_ so the demonic toy can force his hostage to run at gunpoint throw in some silly casualties and ridiculous ending will son of chucky be next and this is bizarrely bad 89 minutes at the movies as is the thing to do in post scream slasher cinema don mancini screenplay slathers on the in jokes and genre parody but little of the humor succeeds proving self reference can be completely worthless when it lacks bite to be fair though most of bride of chucky is on auto pilot so it not quite right to single out one misfired aspect of the film similarly shaky the acting ranges from screeching camp to boring bland the effects aren that special and the story is one big groaner here hoping chucky and his entire clan past present and future rest in peace
this is the first film in what would become the most successful series of horror films of all time fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyone favorite goalie mask wearing homicidal maniac jason the guy who single handedly controlled the overpopulation problem around the crystal lake area doesn start his quest to find the most interesting household item with which to kill someone until the sequel while he does have small role in this film we the audience have to depend on another blood thirsty maniac to rack up the body count the plot like every other friday the 13th movie goes something like this crazed killer murders as many unsuspecting teenagers as he she it possibly can in the space of 90 minute movie the reasons that the afore mentioned unsuspecting teenagers come into contact with the bloodthirsty killer are usually of little importance to the story but for those of you out there that might actually care about such trivial matters in movie such as plot here are the basics bunch of unsuspecting teens get summer job at long closed summer camp they are days away from the arrival of the kids and they are spending their time fixing the place up and making sure it is ready for the kids sadly they start being butchered one by one by the bloodthirsty killer at this point would usually say something about the quality of acting directing or maybe something about the high quality of the production since not going to do that feel free to assume that if did it wouldn be positive will say that this movie looks as if it was made for about hundred bucks and that includes the actors salaries if you are used to recent horror films like scream you are in for bit of surprise the only saving grace for friday the 13th is that it was really the first of its kind with the killer taking real pride in their work using as many methods of murder as they could none of this single murder weapon stuff life that unimaginative leatherface in chainsaw massacre or the creatively stifled imagination of halloween michael myers who just used brute force or really big kitchen knife nope in the friday the 13th movies you can always count on the killer taking great pride in his work one fun fact about this movie is that the cast includes very young kevin bacon although after this movie it is wonder he ever worked again the main reason to see friday the 13th is if you want to watch all of the series from the beginning if not stick with the later films with jason everyone favorite hockey fan friday the 13th is the sort of movie that is fun to sit down and get couple of scares from just don sit down expecting whole lot
this is the worst movie ve viewed so far in 98 the avengers silly man dressed in bowler hat woman wearing tight leathers evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits greater evil sir august de wynter wearing kilt the question is what could have gone wrong with potentially great idea with big name cast the same question was probably asked of last year stinker batman and robin feel the production got little too smug the script little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form movie my greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed thurman and fiennes something that was vital element of the 60 tv serial of the same name the dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks but does not allow much room for character development and interaction except to perhaps grate on the viewer nerves one wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality connery as sir august does not fair better than thurman or fiennes his dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather mostly embarrassing and poor quality if there is movie you would prefer never to see believe the avengers would be good choice for one thing you will not have to witness product that is far inferior to the three high profile names that is associated with the title cannot understand how something so poorly produced could have been released but put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature like lightning you can see it coming until it hits you

mr bean bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of masterpiece american painting the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean trip to la but if they didn look out because you are in for rather interesting if not odd ride heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick either way look out america bean is coming well what can really be said about this movie there is very little discernible plot that much is not hard to grapple with for it is slapstick comedy it achieves that goal rather admirably but because it is that the plot is just screaming for help the whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on whim and carried through and in many causes ad libbed as you went don go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie even if you don like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something are just so stupid the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims or so it seems now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner well there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn the easiest am sure have to concede that mr atkinson acting in this movie is well done although the role isn too demanding the slapstick is think that the character could have had bit more dialogue it would have added quite bit to the overall effect of the movie now the rest of the actors in the movie bad acting and poor casting think that the role opposite bean could have been better just seemed wrong for the movie different actor might have done better job of it but wont presume that wasn what was trying to be achieved one thing that must say simply to get if off my chest is that think transferring sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results tv shows should do just that stay on tv it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers can only think of couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively the best known of those would have to be star trek bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved now another thing that have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people these people will think like did that this movie is stupid and pointless but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie but to be on the safe side am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one

silly film that tries to be siyah comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy with its main asset being beautiful film location along spain mountainous coastline howard pigeon jeff goldblum is 40 year old mineral water salesman who is married for 13 years to wife constantly nagging him elizabeth mimi rogers after surprise birthday party for him where his wife bawls him out for coming late to his surprise party he confides to his best friend that he can stand it anymore and then tells him his plan to kill her while vacationing in the same barcelona hotel where they spent their honeymoon jeff is going through severe mid life crises worried that he looks older than his age he incessantly talks to himself mostly agonizing over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with elizabeth for second time and then why he married her just because she laughed at his jokes and was attractive he stutters and acts like man who has lost his confidence things change on their vacation as elizabeth makes an effort to be nice while jeff now becomes the grouch he nervously rehearses his murder plan in the hotel room by accident the gun goes off and into the pillow where he imagined elizabeth would be sitting when other hotel guests and staff come to check about the gunshot he nervously explains that it was the tv realizing how unworkable his plan is he places the gun in the shattered pillow and throws it into the ocean while he waits for elizabeth but elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip and when after great deal of effort to get reservation at the hotel star restaurant he insists on eating in the room she decides she had enough of him and checks out without telling him as result he goes to the police to report her missing while with the police telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants to be alone his boss and all those he works with are sympathetic to him and he gets job promotion but soon the pillow with the gun is fished out of the water giving the police cause to arrest him and search his home there they find letters he has written incriminating him to the murder the police also find out from the hotel staff about the gunshot heard in his room in jail things look bad for him no one believes him including his friends and lawyer his boss fires him and the papers have field day with the headline story pigeon jailbird out on bail he realizes that his only hope is to track down his wife through call placed on his credit card he tracks her down to mountain resort once there he learns that she took hike up the steep mountain and he gets priest to be his mountain guide after telling him the true story the film is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance he is someone coming apart by the seams while mimi rogers is his perfect foil it was mostly pantomine humor with the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation very minor farce that might appeal to the sitcom crowd the film just didn take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it so it had no chance for siyah humor to develop it instead played its set up of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw
be warned the following review contains some harsh language the blair witch project quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy my colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more and this worked for him well sorry but nothing is nothing nothing is not more it nothiiiiiinggggggggggg do not pay dollars to see nothing nothing is free available all around the world at location near you am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary could just discount them and say well guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow but have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn hold water there must be some other reason then again maybe my first thought is correct think ll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction when hear people praising this film never hear them talking about what makes up about 97% of this movie three kids bickering with each other about being lost they only talk about what might make up possibly to minutes of screen time this being few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout josh over and over this film should not be called the blair witch project it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost and argue with each other oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting josh and if you thought that was scary wait till you see pile of rocks and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear oh yeah and some goo on one of their backpacks you ve never seen terror like this folks and you don want to the chevy chase goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film for current films highly recommend the sixth sense or stir of echoes for creepy filmgoing experience this film is an example of marketing with no substance the marketing was brilliant and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film they want this film to be good and think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don have anything else to praise that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along but this is not it this film could have been so much better just think if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff saw this movie with girl who was extremely pumped for it she was sold on this film and then at one point during it she turned to me and asked are we supposed to be scared by this ve heard one opinion that you have to use your imagination to create the fear in this movie well thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do use their imagination and create good movie mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay bucks for it but even if you like this idea then what are you imagining an entity called the blair witch some rednecks fucking with these kids are either of these things really scary when you think about it ve heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something well sure thats scary in real life but there are lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in movie nor even interesting you could sit in your house and see snake or spider and it could be scary but in film it wouldn be and no movie does not need big budget or cgi special effects to be scary or creepy actually the less the better see the equally awful remake of the haunting but you have to do something you cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary if it were real and by the way about the shakycam filming in blair witch aren these supposed to be filmmakers who should know how to point camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified that justified talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they can seem to shoot anything smoothly at all minor quibble there there is feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers that the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank and think there is good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves what was thinking but if they don then thats fine if it works for them then that okay guess just lament that by making this movie hit we are going to be subjected to more of the nothing is more approach pretty soon we re going to get some movies like this just still shot of prison jail cell for 90 minutes and we ll have to use our imagination and think to ourselves my god wouldn it be scary to spend life in prison this movie is the scariest movie of all time or shot of coffin with some funeral directors arguing with each other man do you know how scary it would be to die now this is the scariest movie of all time [r]
there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of scream queen in the early 80s two of them were halloween movies but the other two prom night and terror train were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween the same god scared there some guy in mask coming after me routine she did in john carpenter classic jamie lee copies here with none of the urgency or suspense terror train takes place on where else train charted by some pre med students finishing their first four years of higher education most of them won make it to med school though and it obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains wish to hell they put radio on that train the conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone even jamie lee from the beginning he talking his head off he tells one of his co workers think on this when the last time someone built shopping mall next to train station as if it makes any kind of sense and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles of course the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find bloody body which is then gone when he brings skeptical trainman back to view it forgot to mention the prologue it party three years earlier with the same group of students two of them play trick on geeky frat pledge promising him he going to get laid they send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in noticing form on the bed she says kiss me kenny and he kisses the body on the bed which happens to be cadaver oh my god they killed kenny you bastards it sick trick and one jamie lee wasn let in on she still hasn forgiven the guy as they board the terror train you asshole you can have good time without hurting somebody the killing starts before the train even leaves the station since it new year everyone wearing disguises convenient plot device we ve seen before and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no one looking at least one of the characters says it groucho mask when the killer dons it and steps aboard it looks like gene shalit who by the way would make great killer in slasher movie speaking of weird looking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene one of terror train most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield as the magician who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music then there his greatest trick getting laid with hair that looks like that for all its attempts at visual style and substance terror train is more lionel than amtrak more prom night than halloween and nothing really worth watching only die hard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield if he truly has any fans should even attempt to watch it and it makes me wonder if horror movie set in an rv could be much worse mean when was the last time someone built shopping mall next to train station anyway terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of sleeper car
according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers isolated motels diners gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers at the beginning of eye of the storm 1991 german american thriller directed by yuri zeltser one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up ten years later their son steven played by bradley gregg who was blinded during the incident still runs motel together with his older brother ray played by craig sheffer hardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone played by dennis hopper gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra played by lara flynn boyle their unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed yuri zeltser author of this film was obviously inspired by hitchcock psycho but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot instead of norman bates we have two brothers one of them traumatised physically another mentally sexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing lot of claustrophobic atmosphere the acting is fine hopper gregg and boyle are comfortable with their roles but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine unfortunately eye of the storm which was supposed to be intense psychological drama deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale in the end this film reminds us that original approach can prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities special note to the profiler fans ally walker appears in the beginning of the film in the small role of killer girlfriend
if you ve been following william fichtner career and there absolutely no reason why you should have you might have noticed that he played some rather similar roles over the years like sully in the perfect storm tough gruff and little bit scary or law in albino alligator tough gruff and little bit scarier or colonel william sharp in armageddon or dwayne engelman in strange days or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of pearl harbor as the abusive father of danny here is an actor who gravitates towards tough gruff hard hitting roles which is why his performance in what the worst that could happen is such shock such delight in the film fichtner plays blonde haired meticulously dressed overtly effeminate dog loving detective as alex tardio fichtner performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it it borders on offensive but doesn really manage it and it borders on clich stereotype but doesn quite succumb to that definition either in role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming fichtner isn perfect you can see him struggling little at times concentrating little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air or nuzzles coiffed canine up close and personal but he pretty damned good and silly and without question the best thing in the film in fact had it not been for fitchner sudden and bizarre appearance and his jarring screen presence thereafter would have walked out for what the worst that could happen is mesmerizing in its awfulness poorly written haphazardly edited and totally unfunny yes it stars martin lawrence and danny devito so how could that be possible moviegoing experience fichtner performance doesn exactly save the film and it not like recommending what the worst that could happen solely on the strength of the actor dramatic turnaround but his contributions do raise the film rating from no stars to one and half thumbs up to fichtner then and thumbs down way way down to everyone else involved in this sorry mess movie so dull and pedestrian and nonsensical it doesn even warrant discussion
for his directoral debut gary oldman chose highly personal family drama about violent alcoholic husband and father and the various lives he affects but while the characters places and events may have special meaning to the writer director the audience is left in the dark the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ray winstone and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars then he returns home to his pregnant wife valerie kathy burke and their five year old daughter raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies and his paranoid delusions early on when he accuses valerie brother billy charlie creed miles of stealing raymond then proceed to beat and bite him to bloody wreck but these are the least of billy problems billy is heroin addict on the downturn and it doesn seem that he ll last much longer billy and valerie mother janet laila morse is raymond nemesis she disapproves of him and he of her but is powerless to do anything about it she merely struggles on hoping her children will survive their respective torments if this description seems bleak haven told the half of it this is not cheery movie and most of the time it downright depressing while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him in the end it not quite worth it there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose take for example the extended sequence where one of billy scuzzy friends defends stray puppy the film is filled with these character moments that never really achieve anything granted there are few genuinely powerful and sickening moments in the film but their expression seems to be more of catharsis for the creator than us the actors do fine job particularly in the central roles the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into the bad thing about an actor turned director is that there no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience oldman got it about half right
my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one but in fact the third installment it was the first to gain national theatrical release didn see the first film until much later so looking back the original didn hold lot of great memories for me since didn think too much of it when initially saw it watching it now for second time confirmed that it an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever you all know the story by now child murderer freddy krueger robert englund returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before this first installment does an adequate job with it low budget but there some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story plus the movie ending understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have hook for sequel renders the rest of the film pointless and does anyone understand what happens to nancy mother at the end of this film don get me wrong though it not as if new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is horror is difficult genre to pull off credibly and nightmare on elm street just doesn cut it nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video it is available both as single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set the film is presented in both pan and scan and it original theatrical aspect ratio of 78 although on the disc that comes in the box set only widescreen transfer is provided the film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio mono mix and new dolby digital mix also included on the dvd is full length audio commentary track with writer director wes craven stars john saxon and heather langenkamp and the film director of photography other extras include the jump to nightmare feature sure you can figure that one out the usual cast and crew bios which are from the film original press release kit and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp and the film original theatrical trailer some dvd rom features are also included but since don have dvd rom capabilities can really get into that the commentary track is entertaining and informative but nothing spectacular the first thing of note is that it the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from few years ago not saying that negative thing just pointing it out everyone seems enthusiastic about being there with the possible exception of john saxon who just doesn say much at all most of the time you ll forget he even there everyone else talks really quietly though for some reason as if because they re commenting on scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series also included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film however you can only access one easily the other is hidden in what called the labyrinth which might possibly be the most annoying feature of dvd ever created basically it an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage interviews etc somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film finding it though is both chore and bore [r]
in 1989 tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather was it deep nope however it was perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was without the comic book uplift of the indiana jones and superman pictures which was true if what you were looking for was the tale of heroic man escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place if those films were tom sawyer then batman was huckleberry finn some critics glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone realized that it was something special mr lovell gave it and wrote that this is batman as batman should be mr travers called it one of the ten best films of the year the praise was deserved from start to finish the film was enthralling exciting and superb in every respect there was no doubt that there would be sequel directed by burton the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes the villains the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman take over and our epectations are always left unfulfilled when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman nose he simply gets mad and when we want catwoman to slither over batman body she gets pushed off building admire mr burton for trying to do more then entertain but the result is mess nothing works out as planned it fails both to entertain and to enlighten hints are made to the audience that this film could be blast alas these are only hints there are don misunderstand me several moments of cinematic genuis contained catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without word on the subject being said christopher lloyd is trapped by the penguin within giant cage small basket is dropped into large river but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis weak followup both career and sequel wise batman returns is sometimes dazzling but to often dissapointing
and thought stigmata would be the worst religiously oriented thriller released this year turns out was wrong because while stigmata was merely boring and self important end of days is completely inept on all fronts it silly incomprehensible endlessly stupid mess for guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best it extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up for the first time in recent memory an arnold action movie and batman robin doesn count is no fun at all end of days is major stinker the movie opens in vatican city 1979 some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy which says that girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 1999 the world will be destroyed the pope orders protection of this girl though some priests believe she ought to be killed in new york that very night girl is born to fulfill the prophecy twenty years later we meet jericho cane schwarzenegger suicidal ex cop with drinking problem now working as security guard for hire he is protecting local businessman gabriel byrne who is actually possessed by the devil an assassination attempt on the businessman by crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after christine york robin tunney recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine including ownership of the same music box apparently jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her there are so many problems with this film it hard to know where to begin but how about starting with the concept casting arnold in role like this was mistake to begin with schwarzenegger is persona not an actor so putting him in role that contradicts his usual strong personality is bad idea arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off character tormented by conflicting emotions in other words trying to give him dimension was mistake harrison ford mel gibson or even bruce willis could have played this role they ve all played noble and flawed heroes but not schwarzenegger there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho character one has him contemplating suicide another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine location by offering him his old life back none of these scenes really work because arnie isn up to the task the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho strong confident character like the terminator for example the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before this one isn at all believable the way arnold plays him the supporting cast tries their hardest and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all as the prince of darkness he suave and confident he acts like one would expect the devil to act the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense more on that later and that undermines him as powerful villain byrne out performs arnold in every scene they have together including the aforementioned temptation bit but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable root for the devil byrne speech about the bible being overrated actually starts to make sense mainly because arnold attempts at refuting it mostly of the tis not variety are feeble at best the only problem is arnold has to win so in the end nobody really cares kevin pollack plays jericho security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides but like most bad action movie sidekicks he disappears after about an hour robin tunney isn given much to do except look scared in fact all of the supporting players are good actors but none save for byrne is given anything interesting to do performances aside it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it this being an action blockbuster it no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script which starts off totally confusing and when some of it is explained and not much of it is it utterly ridiculous why is the devil coming on new year eve 1999 because it exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil which isn 666 it turns out some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down so the real year is 999 so just add to the beginning and you ve got 1999 if you don buy this explanation you re not alone it convoluted and silly at the same time the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous she christine see and she lives in new york see and if that weren bad enough there plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn explained at all why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex cop he powerless is he impervious to only one kind of bullet how come he can control jericho or christine and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies clumsy attempt at joke is made about this but it never actually explained usually this sort of thing wouldn matter in schwarzenegger flick mean don get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting there are several predictable horror film clich present in end of days complete with the old siyah cat hiding in cabinet bit not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there it gets so formulaic that it possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment boo will come their predictions will rarely be wrong the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless partially because we don care about these characters due to the script pathetic attempts at characterization and setup and also because they too don make any sense there scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around room by little old lady it good for few chuckles but not much else supposedly we re to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan but the script never sets that up so the scene is merely silly none of this is terribly exciting because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it often hard to tell why it happening in the first place not to mention that they re edited in full on incomprehensible mtv quick cut style most of them had me scratching my head rather than saying wow cool end of days is not only silly and confusing but it also distinctly unpleasant to watch the devil apparently doesn operate in the more subtle ll convince people to kill each other fashion outlined in the bible but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight this doesn only make him an awfully predictable sort but it also means that not single scene in end of days goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence or the odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit that had me scratching my head if violence is supposed to be shocking it not good idea to throw so much of it into movie that the audience goes numb scenes aren connected through any reasonable means so lot of the time stuff gets blown up or people get killed and had no idea why reasons to hell with reasons let just blow stuff up isn it cool nope not by long shot this film is thoroughly unwatchable it dull interminable and unrelenting in its stupidity perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career because it not happening with hack peter hyams here end of days might have had camp value if only it didn top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody going to buy if the movie is going to be serious the filmmakers should have come up with decent script if it going to be campy arnold shouldn be taking himself so damn seriously didn actually see him put up on cross did and his character shouldn be such sad sack as it stands end of days is just bad movie and an awfully gloomy one at that
stephen please post if appropriate mafia crime isn funny business by homer yen 1998 on particular night when found myself having some free time had chance to either go to sleep early or to see mafia spoof of mafia and crime films such as the godfather goodfellas and casino at 84 minutes in length thought that could enjoy few laughs before getting good nights sleep but by my account think that my laff meter only registered few grins one giggle and maybe one chortle suppose that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable hollywood star lloyd bridges who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this film mafia chronicles vincenzo cortino lloyd bridges life separated from his family when he was young he escapes to america and tries to live an honest life but as fate would have it vincenzo grows up to be powerful and klutzy crime lord following in his footsteps are his two sons joey billy burke and anthony jay mohr like all siblings in powerful crime families they squabble over power the future of the family fortune and women mafia is co written by jim abrahams who also contributed to some gut busting funny spoofs such as airplane and the naked gun but these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of manic silliness at work as write this also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based crime movies in general contain lot of profanity and violence it tough genre to parody was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say please as they decide which sector to take over but this opportunity was never explored there were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed daughter in law gunman shoots him several times the impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him from the samba to disco to the macarena think that just gave away the best part of the film oh well that just means that you can go to sleep little earlier
admit it thought arnold schwarzenegger had knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies watching him in jingle all the way wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such lame movie targeted at susceptible kids it was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg 13 kindergarten cop but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence alcohol consumption burglary racism and child molestation and you know they ll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa elves he later decks reindeer hey man why don you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you re at it jingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass it must be funny school of thought arnold sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than special olympics hockey team and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene what can you expect from movie whose entire premise is that two parents can find rare toy on christmas eve and will do anything to get one arnold is of course one of the parents crack salesman who is never there for his son he races from the office to his son karate game only to find out he missed it and his kid distrusts him because he never around gee we haven seen that in movie before arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son affection is to get him turboman doll which his wife rita wilson who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this told him to get weeks ago so arnold sets out to find turboman which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out let me back up for minute here arnold kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character which is unhealthy beyond belief watches the show eats the cereal sleeps on the freakin turboman sheets try to discourage any further obsession myself lest any kid seeing this movie think it wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want but nooooo the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in parade exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son who don recognize him until the last minute this is sad movie all the way through but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through store racing off to the mall and hooking up with santa jim belushi who runs bootleg toy factory most painful to watch is scene at radio station where sinbad holds off the cops with letter bomb after beating up the deejay an embarrassed martin mull who said he was giving away turboman doll capitalism has produced some pretty evil things chia pets but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping your cookies are incredible it the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want maybe that what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house but not at mine
when the haunting arrived in theaters all kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in horror film are far scarier than those that you can put face to courtesy of special effects while agree that this remake of the haunting goes bit overboard in the visual effects department don think that they are completely to blame for this movie failure it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the unseen terrors and it was about as scary as dust bunny so special effects or not if the story isn the least bit scary you aren going to end up with very frightening movie the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern dern is always great and even though he may have had only about minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie as sat through the seemingly endless albeit fairly impressive special effects kept wishing that this movie was about dern caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast never good sign when bit player is the best part of the movie liam neeson plays scientist who is conducting experiments on fear he decides the best way to get results is to trick group of fairly unstable individuals to spend few days in haunted mansion he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia and he also fails to mention that the mansion has reputation for strange goings on catherine zeta jones lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects like the original taylor character is the star of the movie but since she doesn quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms zeta jones their parts did seem to be big larger than in the original and let face it probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta jones ll admit that would have never seen this thing if she weren in it but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients there really isn much of story here just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with and the special effects are great in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the cool shots quota at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary funny maybe but not scary then we have the set when first saw the house was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it but it only took short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did and decided to take the idiotically overdone route this included flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and mirrored circular room that revolves what part did these rooms play in the story absolutely none they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither descent story nor single scare in the entire movie then we have the actors lili taylor has never been one of my favorites and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in she comes in around the average or slightly below mark have no idea why liam neeson took this role he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in very secure vault along with all copies of darkman zeta jones was cast because she is too hot for words the fact that her character is bi sexual is just icing on the cake all catherine has to do in this movie is look good fortunately that is something she does very well while she does have fairly good size part it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye candy it too bad someone of her talents wasted them here any random supermodel pulled out of fashion show could have easily filled her role the haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999 horror movies the blair witch project the haunting had seemingly limitless effects budget while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to horror film if the story sucks it all downhill from there my advice if you are looking for special effects go rent star wars if it scares you want rent halloween either way it probably in your best interests to skip the haunting
plot set in the future courier has uploaded some data into hard drive that resides in his head and must now escape the bad guys who are after that very important information since he overloaded his hard drive he also racing against the clock before the information seeps into his brain and kills him critique incoherent boring one act drivel with no suspense horribly unbelievable futuristic environment bad dialogue career defining bad acting by keanu reeves and hilarious ending it too bad because the premise of the film was interesting but unfortunately for my friends and this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us it one of those films that makes you start laughing half way through when you realize that most of the actors in it suck the location shots are filmed in dark junkyard type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic whatever and all the sets look like well sets there is also absolutely no arc to this story it basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain and then bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until laughable ending puts stop to the former uneventful proceedings gibson should stick to writing novels and files episodes since his segue into the paranormal tv series was much more entertaining than any of this garbage some other hilarities of this film include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose supposed to kick ass henry rollins as pumped up cyber doctor or something and ice as some kind of hobo dude with paint all over his face don ask the ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and stupid ghost lady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal canada but sadly enough for us all it was some of the cyber travelling special effects were okay hence the 10 but overall it one of those bad movies that just funny to watch and cringe at thankfully for keanu he redeemed his sci fi career with 1999 the matrix 10 it too bad that he has yet to redeem his lack of acting talent little known facts about this film and its stars as of 1999 director robert longo never directed another full feature film hmmm now isn that odd writer william gibson immigrated from the us to canada in 1968 after being rejected for the draft he lived in toronto at first but since 1972 has made vancouver his home his 1984 novel neuromancer and its sequels 1986 count zero and 1988 mona lisa overdrive are generally considered to be the definitive works of the cyberpunk science fiction sub genre this film garnered keanu reeves nomination in the worst actor category in the 1996 razzie awards
am steven seagal fan only say this now because mufti splenetik isn my real name and because probably need to explain why went into this film expecting great things any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones which we ll always hear when seagal does his limb twisting thing rarely female co lead in sight unless it real life model wife who hasn worked since weird science and usually the worst possible titles you can imagine not to mention very straightforward plots generally all round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather face himself in that same siyah outfit he been in since nico doing his my hands are sharp nimble knives thing seagal the stoic sir petrified ponytail duke of dull in the glimmer man seagal breaks out of this formula he gets sidekick attempts to banter and puts on new vest he also put on quite lot of weight small potatoes you may say man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to but damnit if it ain broke why fix it more on this disappointed person dashed expectations later as jack cole seagal is homicide detective with questionable past while he and his partner played by keenen ivory wayans are investigating series of ritual killings cole himself becomes suspect especially when background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole it turns out that cole is former trained government assassin you just can trust these homicide detectives someone whom victims used to catch just glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them and hence well you know that glimmer man thing an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of larger more threatening conspiracy that involves crooked businessman bob gunton cole former cia boss brian cox and deals involving chemical weapons the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff drawing as with his other films elements from the hotter films of the year eg se7en it the other changes that disappoint for example although there fair amount of violence in this movie there also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans probably the best known of the wayans tribe how many are there exactly from television in living colour wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal bead adorned and brocade draped cole keeping up his are you crazy part of the dialogue with wasted zest as campbell wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner eccentric habits but the chemistry between the two is minimal and seagal wooden comebacks make for painful watching cook in under seige seagal is now buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal siyah ensemble he chants refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies again benign if trite plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual heck he has to deliver punchlines and carry steady conversation with someone other than himself for large part of the film is that lot to ask of the seague too much seagal best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages and to do it silently and alone not for seagal the snappy one liners of arnold and stallone nor the attempts to show that he can act much less think no kindergarten cop no oscar just simple unadulterated deathblows that really how it must have started like minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else we trusted him we got to know him now betrayal don know if can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he going to try to be funny again ll try but it won be easy if you haven watched the glimmer man yet you might want to wait for the video to come out it easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences after all if we can depend on our fantasies what can we depend on the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice mufti spelenetik is still steven seagal fan everybody makes mistakes once in awhile
the 13th warrior comes at the end of as summer where we ve already experienced man eating sharks deep mavi sea man eating crocodiles lake placid and even man hunting witch the blair witch project now the 13th warrior presents tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears the story if that what you want to call it follows ahmed ibn fahdlan antonio banderas an arabian poet who falls in love with his king wife and is banished from his home land he then travels to the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador to them eventually the vikings are called upon to protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men thirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission and as you guessed it ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth he not warrior and at first not well accepted by the vikings but as the movie advances he ll have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield that basically the entire plot there is also romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and one assumes drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers didn just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part of the story instead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer the film is basically non stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop story it becomes laughing stock the battle scenes although well choreographed are not involving and not the least bit exciting we don get to know any of the characters and so we don care who lives and who dies the film which wants to be beowolf comes across more as failed action adventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels it was directed by john mctiernan who the thomas crown affair is also playing in theaters currently and it not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that the 13th warrior was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for time to dump it on audiences it belongs back on the shelf
when watch movie like mike nichols what planet are you from can help but feel like everyone is looking at me it as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness eyes shooting daggers quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hard earned money to spend their time watching this this thing shift uncomfortably in my seat reminded of how feel when see pair of second or third rate celebrities engaging in teleprompted funny conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award it not my fault know it not my fault but dammit someone gotta be embarrassed because it doesn look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame about to give you list of names of people who are gonna make movie together garry shandling annette bening john goodman greg kinnear mike nichols do any of these names make you instantly shudder the answer would have come up with before today is no this is quite list of talented individuals we ve got here granted john goodman was in the flintstones and greg kinnear has turned in some less than lackluster leading man performances in certified failures like smile like yours but even so they ve got proven power as excellent supporting players garry shandling has two television classics under his belt his ingenious little it garry shandling show and the larry sanders show and for god sake mike nichols directed the graduate and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty so explain this this thing what planet are you from purports to be comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop psychology mars venus phenomenon but what this movie winds up being is collection of unfunny cringe inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe inducing moments the end result is unsurprisingly an unfunny uninsightful cringe inducing thoroughly icky embarrassment garry shandling plays an alien from planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males they reproduce through cloning of course his leaders put select group of males through series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth find female of the species and impregnate her they re taught how to pretend that they re listening by nodding and saying uh huh and how to compliment shoes imagine my delighted surprise when oh heavens all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably producing comedic results the lucky winner is fitted with penis since theirs after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that they re all just clones whoops too late the penis when aroused tends to make humming noise the writers when frequently strapped for ideas tend to turn to this as source of comedy it isn funny the first time it isn funny the eighth time it isn funny the eighteenth time if anything it made me feel vaguely self conscious garry meets up with coworker at bank played by greg kinnear who turns out to be generic unlikable scumbag he meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling alien character but he so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside kinnear scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples work as his own to worm his way into vice presidents position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks wow what magnificent bastard nearly every man in the movie in fact is played as the same sort of sex driven slimeball when kinnear wife walks into the office there isn single guy who doesn trip bump into wall or otherwise pratfall as if they never seen woman before the few guys that aren particularly slimeballs such as john goodman detective character are simply uncommunicative workaholics shandling meets up with annette bening who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed at one of kinnear aa meetings shandling mission is to have baby and when he reveals his desires to her bening instantly falls for him and the next day they get married yup the next day cuz ya see it turns out she wants baby too bening character perhaps was the most difficult to watch especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as whole then woe say to the species she unfathomably insecure and succumbs so easily to all of shandling lines and lies that it borders on tragic there point where after thinking she may not be able to bear children she learns that she is indeed pregnant when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her she strolls into the kitchen and sings high hopes you know the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song to deliver the news and then says to him now you can leave me we re supposed to empathize with shandling discovery of the feeling of guilt but instead wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of great big nothing and eventually shandling falls in love with her for real suppose though not sure exactly what prompted it what the message derive from all this men are liars inherently empty creatures but if you hang around long enough well maybe something will click ha ha ha thankful such broad cynicism isn frequently allowed to run so rampant let all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one there also subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity goodman through series of astoundingly implausible realizations puts together the fact that shandling is being from another world with magic vibrating penis it has all the makings for subplot of having shandling be discovered that thankfully never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition instead it just dangles limply on the branch for while withers and falls away further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies but let not dwell on this any longer ve already wasted plenty of your time and my own let move on forget about what we ve seen here and get on with our lives and to help us out let end things on happy note congratuations go out to annette bening winner of this week title award for delivering the awkward line of dialog containing the movie name

we re back in blade runner territory with this one conceptual artist robert longo vision of william gibson inspired future where information is the commodity to kill for front and center is johnny keanu reeves cyber courier who smuggles data via wet wired implant he ready to quit the biz and get portion of his long term memory restored but first he has to finish one last dangerous job the pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems to have forgotten how to play an action hero since his stint on speed he walking wood in forest of stiffs that includes henry rollins ice and dina meyer dolph lundgren street preacher is in an acting category all its own without believable performance between them all we can do is sit back and watch the atmosphere which is pretty good in places the vr sequences are way cool but the physical fx such as miniatures and mattes leave lot to be desired watch out for those bad blue screens we wouldn mind minute of johnny mnemonic if the action played better too bad the debut director isn very strong in this de partment his big finale is sloppy silly mess that runs twenty minutes too long which is way past the time that most of our wet wired processors have already shut down bottom line yatf yet another tortured future skip it
ok admit it find camp amusement with the spice girls yes the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual identities they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of girl power but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn enough to carry their big screen debut junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world the film begins amusingly enough with cheeky 007 esque title sequence in which the british quintet scary melanie brown baby emma bunton sporty melanie chisolm ginger geri halliwell and posh victoria adams are introduced one by one to much to my surprise excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience as they croon the silky ballad too much tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film the spicy ones go on european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london royal albert hall film producer george wendt and screenwriter mark mckinney pitch various film ideas to the girls manager clifford richard grant documentary film crew follows the girls pregnant mate naoki mori of the group rapidly approaches her due date and tabloid publisher barry humphries attempts to destroy the group with the help of sneaky shutterbug richard brien capped off by live rendition of the girls bouncy hit say you ll be there wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow right wrong it all downhill from there as spice world collapses into series of misfired comedy sketches must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with funny joke between them much less organized framework for all the wacky goings on spice world jumps from vignette to vignette subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense at one minute having the girls meet with aliens no joke and at another having them stage daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during boat ride while decent joke slips through the cracks here and there during dance bootcamp scene the girls sing the lyric we know how we got this far strength and courage and wonderbra much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level some gags are just plain pointless such as roger moore recurring role as the mysterious chief who dispenses cryptic metaphor heavy advice to clifford the only reason why can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond ha ha as weak as the script is think there one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make spice girls movie and that is the girls themselves the point is not that they can act and for the record they really _can t_ but that their individual personas which works as gimmick over the span of four minute music video are too thin to survive outside of the truncated video bite mtv world posh who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions comes off best by default because her persona rich bitch most easily translates into character in film baby persona young innocent to lesser extent also works but the remaining girls identities are little harder to flesh out there really isn much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often which is _exactly_ what fuller and spiers do and after all what exactly entails being ginger or scary apparently just their wardrobes spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following flashback performance of the spices signature hit wannabe the song is as grating as ever but the energy of the number gives the proceedings much needed shot in the arm setting the stage for wave of self referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters film ideas the film almost mirrors robert altman the player in the way the film snails into itself this section of the film involving all manner of derring do involving speeding bus is perhaps its most effective but it also points up how all the other storylines the publisher the documentary crew lack satisfactory payoff spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family and it will please the spice faithful but this sloppy enterprise surely won win them any new fans which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states once the hype disappears spice world will likely serve as the the spices final hurrah in america
sylvester stallone has made some crap films in his lifetime but this has got to be one of the worst totally dull story that thinks it can use various explosions to make it interesting the specialist is about as exciting as an episode of dragnet and about as well acted even some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by sappy script stupid and unlikable characters and just plain nothingness who knew big explosion could be so boring and anti climactic unless you saw blown away the specliast of the title is none other than action star sylvester stallone in comeback #19 think who plays quiet hermit like bomber who was once bomb expert with the army or something but who suffered change of heart when he and his assistant james woods who shows us exactly what over the top is other than another bad sly film accidentally killed some innocent people during job his credo is killing bad people not innocents and that why he makes big bombs so anyway into his life steps the seductive sharon stone who is basically the girlfriend moll of the stupid son eric roberts of cuban miami kingpin rod steiger in an indecipherable accent which is sometimes cuban sometimes brando sometimes scottish etc turns out sharon is actually using her boyfriend so she can kill him since he killed her parents when she was young so she calls sly leaves messages with him sends him mail etc about planting bomb to kill roberts which sly listens to obsessively and while he works out naked yea also into his life though again comes woods who has been tipped off by stone to catch sly using the cops he tries to set up traps none which really work so when sly calls him he goes ballisitic on his ass over the phone getting so worked up by saying his must be improvised speeches that he seems to pop the vein in his head wide open these are the most exciting scenes in the film and woods becomes the only ounce of entertainment in the film the film tries to offer us moody film noir except with explosions but comes up completely snake eyes it just pretend film noir making it big waste of time and for action buffs the action scenes are pretty lame with some really unrealistic looking special effects penthouse being blown off of hotel looks like piece of cardboard falling into tub then there the much discussed sex scene between sly and stone which are about as mispaired couple as rachel and ross on friends their sex scene is more nauseating then sexy because it shows us more of sly than stone now let guess who we rather see naked okay stone small but perky breasts which we ve seen more times than harvey keitel dick or stallone veiny ass which isn usually shown for very good reason know can really judge it as flaw of the film but come on the worst flaw of the film is this it boring mean was on caffeine when watching it but my friend fell asleep only to be woken up by james woods ranting but good movie does not james woods going nuts make if you re in for some fun action rent sly earlier demolition man which sucks too but in much more entertaining fashion skip this dull film unless you want to see woods or make fun of steiger accent or see stone breasts again
`the skulls is laughably bad thriller teen orientated doppelganger of `the firm so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into hypnotic stupor certain moments are so preposterous that nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter chuckled incessantly all the way home let me share the skulls is secret society conceived inside the walls of yale designed sure to mirror the actual skull bones from the same college luke mcnamara joshua jackson townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year highlights the latest skull scouting report despite some anxiety and caution from others luke accepts entry into the organization soon after he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women driving new car and marveling at the $20 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account yeah dude pretty good deal eh but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating when circumstances become extreme there is no way he can leave the society except maybe as drooling vegetable the premise although lacking in originality certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense unfortunately `the skulls is neither intriguing nor suspenseful nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting it just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack the stars but not the script `the skulls is so bad it attains certain level of entertainment value with the screenplay by jon pogue immediately becoming the basis for slew of unintentional howlers first off upon their initiation into the skulls each new member has to have skull branded onto their arm afterward they are supplied with wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar will they never take this watch off and what if they forget it by their bedside perhaps their secret society was being little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed on top of this they are each given rulebook and key to headquarters gee why not member shirts but my favorite bit is this the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual agree or disagree notions when making collective decisions they are given official skull paddles when flipped to one side they indicate the member agrees with the proposal facing the opposite way means disagreement wouldn they merely express themselves verbally hell no they have to retrieve the paddles for proper vote and maybe afterward they can play ping pong still chuckling about these ludicrous details but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest the cast meanwhile combines pinch of veteran talent with dash of the `dawson creek crowd and fuses the two together ensuring that the embarrassment will be mutually shared union throughout but not entirely accomplished actors like craig nelson as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake and william peterson as fellow board member senator levritt are dealt pathetic villain caricatures and look suitably embarrassed handling them and then there christopher mcdonald who has the capacity to be fun exciting actor mcdonald charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role yes pogue makes it hat trick pray it was `snatch the paycheck and run exercise for all these actors the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better let cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character paul walker the strapping quarterback from `varsity blues is bland but passable as caleb mandrake the judge son walker preserves straight face even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie `dad just killed guy in the ritual room some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb who plays luke longtime chum chloe and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one or maybe not minute one thanks to decent set up from director rob cohen who films early sequences with sense of atmosphere and style it makes you wonder why he didn flee indefinitely from the project because while enjoyable cheese like `dragonheart and the moderate stallone thriller `daylight aren superior cinema they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash aside from unintentionally humoring the audience `the skulls gets little accomplished the thrills and action are lazy and mechanical the story is stuffed with ridiculous formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of secret underground society flick instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization we are thrust into lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage we ve seen it all before and better `the skulls is feeble little circus of stupidity so miscalculated that while it would serve as clever pun term like boneheaded seems just too generous
it difficult to expect much from director whose greatest accomplishments to date are handful of award winning tv commercials as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes that said hayes feature film debut lives up to expectations coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic but occasionally bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the film two stars jake gyllenhall as the immuno deficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his over protective hyper religious reagan loving mother gyllenhall sweet natured delivery of jimmy hilariously na ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy coming of age story jimmy is bubble boy kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with single germ plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld his mom home schools jimmy filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and anti sexual messages until he befriended by chloe marley shelton the beautiful girl next door jimmy falls in love with chloe but is afraid that his love will literally kill him as evidenced in scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for kiss but when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend jimmy builds bubble suit and embarks on hijinks addled cross country voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love the offensive bits have little to do with jimmy rare handicap regardless of what the film protesters would have you believe but instead center on outrageous racial stereotypes including screaming chinese strip club owner and devout east indian hindi but even if you find stereotype humor funny it hard to muster more than giggle for these shallow gags they even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with group of carnival freaks but few of the harsh jabs manage to work especially in the case of kurtz who very bluntly shows the dark hypocritical side of the religious right and wacky send up of cult called bright shiny led by the inimitable fabio unfortunately few giggles can make bubble boy the riotous off the wall comedy it so desperately wants to be honestly it mystery how on earth this movie was ever made and not just saying that because it so mediocre how odd for disney to take gamble on film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that doesn seem to appeal to any particular demographic and has the potential to offend so many and now that the studio is suffering through very public protest against the film by the parents of real life bubble boy david philip vetter maybe disney wondering the same thing hope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile
bats is this year camp flick with the world worst dialogue cheesiest premise and stupidest editor this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity as for the rest of us well say skip it but looking at the box office figures for this one it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway follow their lead and you ll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and bucks to boot love alfred hitchcock the birds almost as much as love the short story on which it is based it saddens me even more then to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror schlock such as bats when mysterious bat attacks occur in small texas town the authorities call in batologist dina meyer to investigate it turns out that creepy scientist bob gunton has genetically enhanced couple bats that escaped from his lab making them smarter and more vicious why has he done this you ask because you see it is apparently scientist job to make things little better even if that means the death of all mankind so the batologist her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff lou diamond phillips have to kill all the bats and save the world of course that can happen before they wallow in some guamo bat shit for the uninitiated get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in professionally produced motion picture consider for example scene where two people are in bat cave the bats are all sleeping but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out what do they do do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can nope they stand there for while transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes we don even get to see what going on the screen becomes mush because the cuts are so quick all we know is that bats are attacking how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains mystery little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies and bats sure could use some of course director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor but it is so conventional it doesn really go anywhere most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist wisecracking sidekick leon who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like hate bats some of these are so bad that they take on double quality they may inspire smirk by their very nature and roaring laugh because they are so inept hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one liners playing such characters does not help actors careers still suppose that if you re looking for movie that is so bad it good you could do worse than bats it does have tremendous amount of camp value not recommending the movie because quite frankly it sucks and know that this might convince some people to go out and see it more power to them
starring shawnee smith donovan leitch ricky paull goldin kevin dillon billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960 classic term that use very loosely to define the original about really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it kind of nostalgic campy feel the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn exactly hurt it either fast forward to the late 80 steve mcqueen isn in the remake this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years nor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role that is unless you count matt dillon brother kevin as hollywood heavy hitter the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original the only things you need now to have great special effects in movie are deep pockets it looks as if the produces of the new blob had couple of holes in their pockets the special effects in this movie are cheesy like the original unlike the original they don look campy they just look cheap one bright spot in the movie from purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith she is very attractive and can actually act which is more than can say about some of her costars in terms of plot little ball of pink goop falls from the sky seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on satellite anyway the pink stuff has taste for humans the more people it absorbs the bigger it gets and it isn the friendliest goop on the block either anyway it attacks this little town and it up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it not really but that is how it seems this version attempts to recapture the camp of the original as ve already said this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap badly acted and badly written than campy in the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness although star shawnee smith had very tiny role in armageddon the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple they all stunk out loud although some of the film smaller roles are filled with some actors that while not big stars are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows it also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible sadly it doesn work very well if you want to see big ball of goop terrorize town then would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original although that isn so hot either this newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities
toward the bottom of the 80s action movie barrel lies action jackson the only movie in hollywood history to show sharon stone and vanity topless within span of ten minutes this carl apollo creed weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs evil establishment crook and relies on all the 80s trappings from the token heroin addict who needs fix to the shouting superior officer somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs although there is curious lack of exploding boobs weathers is action jackson detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques speaking of one past criminal apprehension jackson superior yells you tore his arm off jackson replies he had spare jackson has been busted down to desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane craig nelson and now has to act as department liaison to dinner honoring nelson after hearing what jackson thinks of him stone says take it you re not one of dellaplane friends not unless they changed the definition jackson glowers and of course it turns out stone is mrs dellaplane faux pas jackson not everything is happy in motown people are being killed and dellaplane has evil plans for the awa it all up to jackson to stop it and his only lead lies in vanity not his own wherever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson she plays the heroin addict and chanteuse in dellaplane nightclub after singing one particularly sultry number for him she saunters over and complains expected standing ovation he responds you re getting one and it damn clever because he sitting down at the time prince wouldn even let out an innuendo that lame and he the king of the horndogs or at least the prince it testament to the 80s that sharon stone is killed off within the first 30 minutes but vanity survives the whole movie action jackson is another variation on the unlikely partners buddy action flick with jackson lugging junkie vanity around this leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade and with the dialogue they re given there not much room for improvement my favorite is when vanity feeling the effects of drug withdrawal says feel like my teeth are hollow my gums are made of dry rubber and someone trying to start bonfire in the back of my bloody head jackson response is think felt that way once they called it love you ll understand when say watch this at your own risk serving the world for nearly 25th of century
if anyone had been able in 1983 to forsee late night cable show hosted by gilbert gottfried showcasing some of the worst films of the 80 they agree cab is the quintessential usa up all nite movie it one of those childish rated movies that kids would love but can see until it edited for tv it also one of those pointless almost plotless movies with hardly any laughs and strike three it pairs mr with gary busey heard gilbert say cab had an all star cast but still hoping there was some degree of facetiousness in that statement when third billing goes to two minute appearance by famed flashdancer irene cara as herself you can say damn thing about all star casts likewise for token appearances by marsha roz warfield paul rodriguez and politically incorrect host bill maher before he was somebody appearing in cab pretty much had the opposite effect on everyone else especially irene gonna live forever cara cab is an ensemble comedy from joel schumacher who would go on to direct batman forever about bunch of misfits who drive cabs you get the feeling if the police academy cadets had made different career choice this would be the result except here you have such interesting characters as the token beyaz guy busey who wants to get in tight with the blacks now before they take over the world the token jive talker named tyrone charlie barnett who wears his hair in rollers and uses the word honkey as much as possible the tough guy with the mohawk and altin chains mr real stretch for him the aspiring musician waiting for his big break maher the mexican gigolo rodriguez the woman who actually wants to drive cabs for living warfield and the guy who wants to own cab company for living adam baldwin we ve all seen dozens of bad comedies from the 80 some are fun to watch and some are actually funny this one is more or less neither you think plenty of comedic sparks would fly from the assemblage of talent whatever but cab more or less falls flat on continual basis culminating in the usual contrived hollywood finale as baldwin is kidnapped and the other cabbies have to go to rescue him it shame no one was able to rescue this movie from the depths of stale jokes and unoriginality cab has rightly earned its position on usa up all nite
written by alex cox tod davies terry gilliam and tony grisoni directed by terry gilliam ve always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid dropping acid is like riding roller coaster blindfolded you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat and no idea how long the ride will last then there the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting strychnine laced dose mushrooms on the other hand offer the psychedelic equivalent of leisurely ride on ferris wheel steady reassuring assent short period of thrilling motion and color and then smooth landing acid is for daredevils mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas director terry gilliam has made an acid movie when wish he would have made mushroom movie full of shocking sight gags aggressive images and grotesque comic performances the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter thompson book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world view from the inside out but for those of us who just want to enjoy well made film gilliam has produced mixed bag fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self professed gonzo journalist hunter thompson johnny depp and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta benicio del toro came to las vegas to cover motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of district attorney convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to man of means in 1971 operating under the pseudonyms of raoul duke and dr gonzo the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender then hole up in hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite cocaine tequila and rainbow of multi colored uppers and downers they terrorize every one they meet mostly because every one they meet terrifies them duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge dr gonzo becomes enamored of thick bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane beyaz rabbit reaches its climax and these guys don just trash hotel rooms they rape them humiliate them and leave them for dead that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence depending on your point of view thompson book besides being hilarious read has stood the test of time as an important historical document it simultaneously exposed the 60 drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson message but the truth is that stripped to its bare essentials what gilliam has wrought is drug comedy it cheech and chong movie you re there to watch depp and del toro ingest lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results see johnny take drugs see johnny fall down there nothing wrong with this concept but gilliam tries too hard this is frantic movie all sweaty close ups wide angle lenses dutch tilts and other worldly lighting schemes there are times when gilliam really does put convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen but to what end much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson book and there are some priceless comic observations but you re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work this brings us to the performances which strike me as all wrong depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george scott in patton gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson dialogue in between his several puking scenes del toro fares better as dr gonzo but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads now that would have been something to see it interesting to note that alex cox credited as co writer on the screenplay was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over as much of fan as am of gilliam work cox would have been the better choice sid and nancy cox best work covered essentially the same subject matter but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film gilliam commits the compound sin of over directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose what kind of movie was he trying to make anyway it doesn try to be cautionary tale and it doesn work as broad comedy if he had considered more carefully his purpose the result would have been much more interesting film but don want to be too hard on it there are some truly funny moments and if you re in good enough mood you might get kick out of it do however recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance guarantee it will enhance the effect
the best thing about lake placid is that it only 80 minutes long and when it over you re glad that you didn waste more than an hour and half of your time it nothing more than bad rip off of jaws and think that being kind it was written by david kelly ally mcbeal as horror comedy but fails at both miserably was never scared and think that only laughed once the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in anaconda the plot begins when man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in siyah lake in maine that brings the local sheriff brendan gleeson and fish and game warden bill pulman to investigate also paleontologist bridget fonda from new york is sent to look at tooth and an eccentric millionaire crocodile lover oliver platt flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it there also an eccentric old lady betty beyaz who lives by the lake and has few secrets as mentioned before kelley and director steve minor h20 don go for serious approach towards the material but they also don have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either the betty beyaz character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting they re all basically idiots if they had any brains the croc wouldn have been that much of challenge to catch and they wouldn have put themselves in half of the situations that they did but then again if they were smart there wouldn be movie basically lake placid is best undiscovered
that is unless you re one of those people who have seen the preview thousand times on tv or in the theaters can tell you one thing now they gave the entire movie away why someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me however if they hadn given it away the film would ve still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter obviously the producers thought they could remake the deep end of the ocean throw in tommy lee jones and couple of cliches and call it an action drama double jeopardy offers solid acting from ashley judd and tommy lee jones who got first billing even though he didn see to be on screen half as much as judd did it also offers some genuinely funny clever or full of tension moments my favorite judd waking up in the coffin but none of that can salvage the film from its insanely predictable plot half the time wondering whether watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries which always turn out to be less exciting than advertised judging by the beginning end and huge chunk of the middle might have been watching special hallmark presentation too the movie stretching for an almost two hour long film with only 30 minutes worth of material implausible material no less loose interpretation of one of the amendments aside too many times in the movie thought that is not possible that kind of stuff is excusable in popcorn movies but not one like double jeopardy that tries to pass itself off as serious drama everything seems dragged out overplayed when they should ve kept us in the dark they let the cat out of the bag too early
had an epiphany today it occurred to me while was watching house on haunted hill it is as follows if trailer makes the film it advertising look like trashy stupid movie well guess what chances are there is truth in advertising too bad didn trust my own instincts when something or the other possessed me to see this movie blame it on my sudden craving for scare and my anticipation of sleepy hollow that and dogma started too late in the afternoon for my schedule an hour of angel or buffy is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face wish seen it when it was halloween at least would have been forgiving hey tis the season the movie was scary albeit very confusing dizzying and nauseating at first but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn going anywhere now truly appreciate films like scream halloween or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic that what spooks people out the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know there has to be logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with sure utterly unpredictable is good too but that different from utterly nonsensical hohh house on haunted hill on the other hand well let just say about fell off my chair laughing when they oh so cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house couple of decades ago riiiiight know that just sends chills down my spine yeah just like wet my pants when they told me the house is evil ooooooo hint blood and guts only work few times sooner or later people start to tell themselves that it just ketchup and props and you ve got to come up with something better than that there were just too many things in this movie that we ve all seen before from the inevitable plot developments of strangers unwittingly trapped together strangers turning against each other the evil manifesting itself the dead coming back for last scare each was more predictable than the last why didn these fools just stay together in one place anyways sheesh was grossed out yes did get spooked few times yes but why get really disturbed when there is no why when there weren random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect which wasn that good either trust me and the scare the film was filled with drab laughable dialogue the characters were incredibly flat and cliched not to mention downright annoying you ve got bunch of people going nowhere in their lives of course they re dumb enough to go to party some stranger invited them to provided they win million dollars if they survive the night jeez thought no one fell for those you may already be winner things anymore and of course all three gals are babes wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of shine ended up in this movie keep that up geoff and you ll qualify for the next batman venture the only single person enjoyed was chris kattan because well he just cracks me up and famke jansen sp because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan pierce brosnan hey willingly endured dante peak three times for him all right concede there were couple of things enjoyed that perverted little amusement park at the beginning probably won ride rollercoaster for while and the machine they used to drive geoffrey character mad see don even remember their names the machine not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie it wouldn have redeemed the film but at least it would have made me feel better but no they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending thank god they didn add kiss at the end or would have puked god there is no hope
director andrew davis reworks his fugitive formula and the results are about as exciting as his last film the dreadful comedy steal big steal little was funny keanu rather play music than play another action hero reeves is the grad student on the run who along with his superfluous sidekick rachel weisz has been framed for sabotaged science experiment that vaporized eight chicago city blocks the mushroom cloud explosion is knock out and easily the best part of the movie or as one audience member succinctly summed it up whoa false information implicates their involvement and boy and girl are soon on the run fleeing over open drawbridges across icy lakes and through the corridors of power at top secret underground energy facility aiding and abetting is the team shady mentor played in an excellent but so what performance by morgan freeman brit brian cox is also about as the behind the scenes bad guy he has some fun fiddling with southern accent unfunny overscored and without single shred of suspense chain reaction is the summer movie to walk out on if you make it to the end mess of cross cutting involving another imminent explosion you ll hear somebody say guess it time to go heed that warning
one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often acclaimed director sidney lumet gloria remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film had absolutely no effect on me occurred when was driving home from the theatre suddenly realized that since had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before had not thought once about the film had just invested nearly two hours of my life in when movie is over aren we supposed to think about it for while and have conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with thought so but for one saw this particular picture by myself and #2 even if had been with someone there wouldn have been anything to talk about in the first place to be sure gloria begins with stirring rather poignant prologue in which seven year old boy family is brutally gunned down by mobsters in search of disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it right before the men broke in of course his father gave him the disc to escape with eventually the boy named nicky nunez jean luke figueroa is caught by the mobsters and taken back to their apartment meanwhile gloria sharon stone has just gotten out of prison for crime she didn commit and returns to her ex boyfriend jeremy northam to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime when he refuses to give it to her and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky she leaves with him in order to save his life but not before holding the men at gunpoint stealing all of their money and forcing them to strip nude gloria is the type of fast talking smart mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people and she never expected to be stuck with kid but she has heart of altin don they always in this type of movie and is only trying to protect the boy whom she quickly begins to form close bond with the previous incarnation of gloria by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands remains unseen by me but was no doubt superior even though can really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one regardless of the director or stars there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original but the film itself is simply lifeless with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn completely unbearable to watch liked for example very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at and keeps turning the car around then driving little ways then slamming on the brakes and turning around again these bright moments however appear long and far between and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria which is both painfully predictable and by the numbers throughout my mind was repeatedly asking the question who really cares as gloria sharon stone has adopted an over the top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn sound realistic at all in the beginning in fact was amazed at how amateurish stone performance was but as the film progressed she got better although not one of her better turns stone does have comic flare that refuses to be ignored jean luke figeroa was fine as nicky and little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted none more than cathy moriarty an entertaining actress in her own right who is billed fourth and has all of one scene as gloria friend whom she turns to for help sony the studio that released gloria obviously does not have any faith in the film and don blame them they declined to screen the picture for critics which is never good sign particularly with the high profile people involved although how much money movie makes does not determine how good it is just look at the spectacular in dreams which failed to even make the top 10 last week have suspicion gloria is going to vanish from theaters faster than ishtar judging from the opening night 00 showing saw it at where there were about ten to fifteen people present counting myself although stone can be an impressive actress just watch her in 1995 casino or 1996 last dance if you don believe me and sidney lumet can be respectable director there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of gloria was worth remaking or for that matter why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of chance to be successful
pre review note seeing as the only concern of body shots is sex will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review because of this will try to vary word descriptions of sex meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms and or your name is jerry falwell you are kindly invited to hit the up on the left corner of your screen so if there happens to be word you come across and cannot comprehend fret not it most likely just another way of referring to sex think we all agree that any word used incessantly becomes bit monotonous so hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be very boring review though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what body shots is film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously in the way you normally expect to see violent attack it about people who think about screwing seek it out and talk about it these are things we all do sometimes the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts their lives center around the next sexual encounter but they seemed depressed it as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after busy workweek at its core body shots is message movie the kind of thing could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition michael cristoffer who directed gia another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil is moralist with nothing new to say his characters don communicate anything of interest to each other so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera they voice simplistic platitudes like like to come or sex without love equals violence huh and yes that is as complex as this movie observations get the characters are stupid and shallow with not one registering as anything more the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure then the after math the morning after of such events we meet the characters as they speak directly to us confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them giving you the pros and cons but for this film cannot not trying to be clever or witty but honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others with the exception of trent played by ron livingston as bargain basement patrick bateman the rest fade into each other patchwork of fake breasts defined abs pearly beyaz teeth and creamy flawless skin vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one only because his character gets the worst lines sex without love equals violence in between all the confessionals cristoffer films everything like headache commercial with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning the fact that this director at one point won pulitzer prize completely baffles me this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and obsessed fine don have any problem with film that tries to persuade me to think certain way but cristoffer only gives us one side additionally that one side isn even entertaining the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness or realism one sexual encounter takes place outside club on chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other alas if it could only be that easy kidding of course then not only isn it erotic it isn real it doesn feel like an authentic sexual encounter every scene in this film and there are many is treated in the same unsexy manner body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it and most of all it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it the resulting search for nookie and you can take that cookie over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow the main concern is much ado over rape that may or may not have occurred the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape one where it is consensual the other where it is not and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off this is topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently and if memory serves me can think of one film that has done so and yes saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80 next to wall street unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care not the writer the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of noxious 90210 spin off paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in manner similar to what cristoffer does here though boogie nights succeeded it was similarly moralistic but it gave us two different viewpoints it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters and it showed us the possible fall out of such decision the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here but anderson seemed to care about them he gave them heart cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones he preaches to us by using his characters to preach to us this is not the way to get any message across why not just direct public service announcement on the perils of hittin skins cristofer kind of does that though without an ounce of insight and with helping of leering exploitation
guessing and from the available evidence it not great guess that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess stupidity ego and power mongering if so the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history it has already been well documented that the original title an alan smithee film became problem when miserable test screenings forced re cuts against the will of director arthur hiller prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors guild mandated pseudonym of alan smithee that left film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas as humorless hack as ever put finger to word processor and you could just smell the disaster brewing if you re unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn you ll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up ostensibly it pseudo documentary account of director named alan smithee eric idle who loses control of big budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone whoopi goldberg and jackie chan all of whom appear as themselves when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called an alan smithee film which of course it already is smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it among the parties interviewed are the film producer james edmunds ryan neal and studio boss jerry glover richard jeni who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them it bad enough that burn hollywood burn has literally not single laugh for its entire blissfully brief 84 minutes what makes it even worse is eszterhas insistence upon telling every bad joke not once but twice or even three times michael ovitz references showgirls references oral sex references whoopi goldberg ted danson references all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas stock in trade the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency notably with the hilarious use of the word feminist as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film by the time coolio and chuck show up as siyah independent film makers the brothers brothers cleverly identified as bad and badder among other unprintable things you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified those documentary captions for all their leaden obviousness allow the best insight into what so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time new character appears the producer is liar who slept in the beyaz house the media are maggots and leeches working for publications like the new york slimes and newsleak with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you don miss the joke it doesn even matter that eszterhas tags penile implant after his own name when he makes cameo because it seems like such desperate attempt to feign self deprecation this is petulant schoolboy idea of satire pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken pen to draw little moustaches and siyah out the teeth the last stomach churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out takes over the closing credits the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and half of your life away perhaps it was just final desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film or to convince everyone involved that few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career pity everyone involved with this excessive ego driven satire of excess and ego it too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this otherwise you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees
meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood screams the television ads for hanging up disastrously written by real life sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton make me laugh again not only is hanging up misadvertised since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two co stars lisa kudrow and diane keaton little more than extended cameos but they don actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes and we are supposed to believe their strong bond and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship despite them being apart for the majority of the running time excuse me again while almost bust gut at that truly delusional notion eve marks meg ryan is the middle mozzell sister still living in the california town where she grew up and with husband adam arkin and pre teen son jesse james her elderly wisecracking father lou walter matthau in his brightest performance in years has just recently been put into the hospital in the final stages of what assume is alzheimer even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him while eve relationship with her mother cloris leachman is nearly nonexistent since she ran out on lou and her children years ago she has had her fair share of up and down with lou who used to be an alcoholic her older sister is georgia diane keaton an editor for the self titled magazine georgia while maddy lisa kudrow is the youngest soap opera actress interestingly their professions are given but we not once ever see them working at their jobs or for that matter learn much of anything about them maddy georgia and eve do not see each other much anymore their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another and they talk and talk and talk in fact the telephone is the major star of the film even more so than ryan as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92 minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long if you are able to get through the opening half hour in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking sledgehammer to them you will surely survive the rest the question is who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating self involved pat on the back how could comedy drama that has the star power of meg ryan lisa kudrow and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways issues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up but the film isn mature enough to deal with such thing in thoughtful manner and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood it is lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought also it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another but no dynamic metamorphosizes and when they do reunite in the finale their whole consanguinity is reduced to repulsively annoying three minute scene in which they argue like little children you can see the impending death coming mile away and it conveniently occurs in the next scene so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves and with each other you think to yourself the only thing left for them to do is have playful food fight and like clockwork it also occurs by the end credits meg ryan is versatile actress look no further than 1998 hurlyburly or 1994 when man loves woman despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies with hanging up the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron writer director hack who shouldn be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big budget high profile debacle even if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department she nonetheless is very good and the two scenes that work flashbacks to christmas 1988 when she had heartbreaking run in with her mother and to halloween 1993 when lou crashed her son birthday party in drunken stupor are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations diane keaton as georgia is better as an actress than director here but that is wildly feeble compliment what is more than little far fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children she is no more than five years ryan senior yeah right lastly poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in big screen venture after her even more thin role in 1999 analyze this kudrow isn given enough time to create full personality with maddy so it isn her fault she doesn register until few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue if anything though kudrow is real talent and anxiously await the next time she is given role more deserving of her time as in her brilliantly nuanced oscar caliber work in 1998 the opposite of sex if you are fan of kudrow and who isn do yourself favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than hanging up does in its entirety as eve hardworking husband adam arkin is predictably squandered with role that gives him next to nothing to do until subplot reveals itself midway through only to never be mentioned again cloris leachman as with ryan and matthau makes small but noticeable impression with her albeit very brief appearance while edie mcclurg as rosy cheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas 1988 flashback manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production nearly all the emotions displayed within hanging up are patently manufactured and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters aside from eve why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats if for some bizarre twilight zone type of reason you find yourself in movie theater showing this film my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over saying it is waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions
disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities the result is merely an academic exercise leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn build on to show them as the poets they were on paper this shouldn have been so terrible it had talented director in agnieszka holland the secret garden proven screenwriter in christopher hampton dangerous liaisons and capable cast but the film was done in by its inept script the unappealing way the film was directed and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud found his performance to be the most risible one in the film with him acting more like teenage brat than young genius spouting obsenities without giving hint that true poet lies behind that facade he especially looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin character he was forced to be but when the two of them were together it looked like mismatch leonardo rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude yet we know from rimbaud poetry that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring the film opens in post revolutionary france in 1871 the 16 year old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine letter with his poems he accepts verlaine praises and invitation to be house guest in his splendid paris home and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville once there rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household has an immediate conflict with verlaine busty 18 year old wife mathilde romane and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family money even though he has nothing else in common with her when verlaine states poets can learn from one another rimbaud replies in haughty tone only if they re bad poets he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship verlaine proves to be weak willed beating his wife regularly and plays just as despicable character as rimbaud when mathilde father kicks rimbaud out of the house verlaine finds him in rooming house and the two become lovers it real downer to watch this story unfold into series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for divorce in brussels verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19 he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and gun runner and after ten years there comes home with tumor on his knee and dies changed man at the age of 37 the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying the film ends on whimper with verlaine talking with rimbaud sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published this film was especially annoying because rimbaud poems are filled with visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film but whatever it was it just didn work it certainly didn bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so called father of modern poetry
in our time in our modern world where the cool rule it hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming the man and yet film after film after film is based on his everlasting magic in warner brothers latest production shakespeare is kicking ass to rap beat while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare romeo and juliet its title sequence with frightening rap song and siyah limo making its way through the dark streets of new york is very hard to associate with shakespeare poetry the film takes place during silent war between the two major mafia families in the city the afro americans against the chinese the youngest son of chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered the afro americans are immediately suspected but peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers it is at this point that han the romeo of the story finds out about his brother death escaping from prison in china he returns to united states to avenge his brother fate but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks he falls in love with mysterious beauty the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy there only weak echo of shakespeare talent in this disappointing production and there are more problems besides its title of course we don call it deformation of great masterpiece we call it modernization it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics without any car chases and gun fights this lack of respect for the audience find very disturbing kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn need to be updated because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature and as long as love hate honesty and corruption do exist everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare must admit that found rome must die very confusing can forgive andrzej bartkowiak since it is his first attempt at directing he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with firm precision unfortunately he completely forgot about character and story developments his latest picture is therefore visually impressive but intellectually hollow the love story between han jet li and trish aalyah and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has magical voice their achievement save this film from being completely braindead but they are not actors and therefore can not act they are nothing more than two celebrities put together the other actors including isaiah washington russell wong henry and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances delroy lindo is the only one that projects coherent image of reality but there more than acting to worry about even with li incredible skills in martial arts the action scenes though technically excellent are too long and story updates simply embarrassing to make long story short romeo must die is not intelligent enough to be thriller not sensual enough to be love story and too serious to be fun action film it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to romeo and juliet so the film is completely stuck not sure of what to be and in the end it nothing there are no performances worthy of notice no interesting character or story surprises so again the only good thing about it is its technical achievement this film can boast of great sound fast paced editing solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre it is mostly provided by aalyah enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists that create kind of ghetto feel to it but when think back it not much remember from this production as in almost every summer movie there are some interesting scenes but most of the moments that remember are associated with massive special effects it is not film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities simply because it doesn have any for someone who has never read shakespeare it another popcorn film for those of us who has it waste of money time and brain cells
isn it the ultimate sign of movie cinematic ineptitude when you can think of much to say about it other than it sucks one of the first official year 2000 releases supernova is such movie can seem to get past one word adjectives with this one although boring stupid and absurd doesn amount to much of review shame would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate but est la vie here goes nothing ll keep it short suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill 48 hours removed his name from the movie requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee the film fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press an event usually signifying studio lack of confidence in particular movie hill and mgm actions were prudent when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in tragic hyperjump accident reformed drug addict who is also the first officer for some reason james spader is forced to take command the ship picks up distress call from nearby planet and on arrival picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony one of the crew members angela bassett knows this passenger who is played by peter facinelli and has some bad feelings about it and we all know what that means this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it another one of the crew members experiences this first hand after spending few minutes partially inside this glob of goo he does some impressive handstand pushups evidently touching this enigmatic egg shaped thingie makes you younger and stronger how why the movie never bothers to explain soon enough though spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad being chased by the all of sudden superhuman facinelli to be honest don even remember exactly why just remember that didn care supernova plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb but they are all dropped before they have chance to develop into anything truly intriguing in fact everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set well the effects are good though there hardly studio movie with bad special effects these days so not sure whether that so remarkable an accomplishment the performances are hardly worth talking about not even sure can call what here performances though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger james spader is not bad actor but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars ve seen in while mostly because he isn given character with personality the action scenes are just as bland since they re pretty much just rehashes of action elements that weren particularly entertaining the first time around and since the action scenes are everything to this movie it pretty much dead in the water and for the life of me can figure out why it called supernova
idle hands is distasteful crass and derivative if an original thought found its way into this horror comedy it would die of loneliness plus you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teen agers the week after the tragedy in littleton colo the movie is insulting to horror film fans and teen agers the plot what little there is deals with anton devon sawa high school slacker who hand goes on murderous rampage after becoming possessed along the way the hand kills anton parents and his two best friends the friends also slackers are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them that is the level of this atrocity humor the movie treats death as joke idle hands is gruesome and morbid the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish realize this is supposed to pass for comedy but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen it is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life and can only presume that the writers of idle hands terri hughes and ron milbauer were trying to make some statement about today young people and their values in satiric vein however it hard to laugh at death these days especially ones involving young people with the real horrors of the world put before us on television stale pastry such as idle hands should be held from release for few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths idle hands is bad no matter the circumstances in the world outside but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings the time is not right for this type of movie and as far as idle hands goes the time may never be right this is movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema
movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as movie about mood rings family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand wringing detail still can recall comedy about the subject before bye bye love and after it still can bye bye love is rarely funny more often weak and melodramatic retread of common tv movie fare only few moments which have nothing to do with the film main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children dave matthew modine father of two is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend vic randy quaid is foul humored father of three about to go on rare date donny paul reiser pines for his ex wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma eliza dushku over the course of the weekend the three men face various crises including vic blind date from hell janeane garofolo and donny growing estrangement from emma the three lead actors form rather unlikely combo and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality randy quaid is the best of the three bitter without being irritating gleefully spiteful without being frightening his run ins with is ex wife lindsey crouse are bit over played though and his confrontation with pompous radio psychologist rob reiner is gimmicky and implausible he does get bye bye love best sub plot hilarious dinner date with gloriously demented janeane garofolo and he does great slow burn paul reiser really has only one character his slightly befuddled uptight nice guy mad about you persona but he does it well as personality he is appealing but as character he becomes pretty boring here matthew modine is quite simply terrible this isn performance good enough to be called mailed in he even forgot to put stamp on it modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under written role looks bored most of the time and gets stuck with trite little speech about how it all his father fault he such cad carolco executives whose entire future is resting on modine bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island must be sweating buckets right now bye bye love basically comes off as very confused movie because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids making it just another dating in the 90s movie when the movie does deal with the children at all it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and or cry perhaps to be resolved later by sensitive talk and hug perhaps not even more confusing is sub plot featuring the late ed flanders as widower who goes to work and mcdonald and befriends troubled youth it is sad end to flanders career getting caught up in truly annoying over use of mcdonald as location plot device and apparently major advertiser even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent child relationships it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break ups and their effects on children any way you slice it it is bad situation for kids and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue it is left to the dads romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is and it isn enough there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching bye bye love is genuine shame
according to the publicity material with this movie the directors hope to restore good old fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness hmm you never know they just might be on to something what with the rise of geek chic lounge music and seventies fashion the ever contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own but then doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it it cheesy all right but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch that shame because in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be lot more woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise roy munson the movie opens in the fifties with roy dad dishing out the reader digest gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls shifting to the 70s for hilarious spoof of saturday night fever the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken it thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good he gives the wry derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy mccracken dupes munson into hustling job then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy hand then it fast forward 17 years later when munson is fat balding loser with prosthetic rubber hand he hopeless until he meets ishmael randy quaid an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno picking up pretty hustler claudia vanessa angel on the way with the exit of bill murray the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go and that dumb and dumber yes indeed kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour peter and bobby farrelly the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle so prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands distended nipples ridiculous hair and bull semen get set for stock fish out of water situations when city boy roy puts on beard and tries to blend in with the amish community or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking striptease and unchristian neighbour socking now don get me wrong there nothing wrong with cheap humour and had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy the trouble is that these jokes aren bold or funny enough to drive movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction it lurches from sports movie to amish mocking to road trip to sentimental melodrama pausing for broadside spoof of indecent proposal and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack never quite getting it all together some gags fall flat from lack of build up while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don do anything why the long unfunny fight in the car park why two of these why does that guy wear mascara or that guy have glass bowling ball with rose in it the film is full of these half thought through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying wouldn that be funny well no actually the actors don do the movie much favours either woody harrelson comes off okay plausibly acting dumb smart cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it but randy quaid is ceaseless ham and vanessa angel has no talent like schwarzenegger she seems more convincing playing computer creation than human take the tv series weird science please even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie climax all in all fairly useless attempt at comedy and certified no hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance we ll have to look to reinspired john waters or perhaps somebody from down under strictly bowling anyone for the definitive bowling comedy the flying inkpot rating system wait for the video little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
what contrast in the space of two days saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly not sure you could get two more different movies while the former was all over the top telegraphing everything shoving its philosophy of life down our throats hurlyburly was the complete opposite wound so tight and with so much buried in its script one could spend weeks thinking about it this is one interesting movie it very much in similar vein to one of my favourite movies of 98 in the company of men although not quite so nasty there lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men hurlyburly doens contain much plot we just follow eddie sean penn around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him his big question is does it all pertain to him and if it does how is he supposed to feel about it all it means everything television friends events that happen guess it could be summed up more crudely as what it all about this is not movie for answers donna anna paquin gives some but they re not really satisfying they just lead to more questions that what makes this movie stay on your mind these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time even when we push them to the background however we resolve these questions influences everything we do the performances are all superb in hurlyburly haven seen sean penn in much before in fact can remember seeing him in anything but he is brilliant in this eddie isn likeable character but sean penn makes him understandable don want to be his friend but like to help him chazz palminteri is also great as phil making him an awful person never want to know phil but still understand why eddie wants to be his friend everyone in this film nails their performances making this world real it nasty world it sexist world unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct hurlyburly is man world seen unapologetically through the eyes of men find this fascinating and on two counts depressing first it depressing that such world exists large part of hurlyburly success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood that there are large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world toys playthings sure everyone is background to everyone else but in this world women are long way in the background second these are the movies that are being made stories about men world where are the stories about women world not the soap operas and the chick flicks that are meant to satisfy women but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men hurlyburly is based on stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts it very talkative intelligent and static while this can make the film drag bit and people sometimes sound like they re quoting textbooks mostly this is good thing not all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen it also means that you have to pay attention
capsule the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith films gets their own movie the gags are sporadically funny it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti gay jokes the plot is weak and the leads are not particularly funny comic team the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night and it turns out he had very good reasons low to +4 film needs plot it needs characters for empathy value it needs story and an emotional center if film is just chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are kevin smith has now made two satisfying films clerks and chasing amy with dogma he tried to make philosophical religious comedy and mixed with madcap romp peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it his remaining two films mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at teenage audience jay and silent bob strike back is compendium of gay jokes penis jokes flatulence jokes film pastiches and in jokes how funny the jokes are will be subjective call for me the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny there was not enough cleverness or variety it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay penis jokes work only so many times showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were clever pair of human running gags they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post war films including dead of night the lady vanishes and passport to pimlico jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation stoners as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads jay and silent bob played by jason mewes and kevin smith are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks this leaves them at loose ends they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into movie they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny silent bob being silent can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his this makes his piece of the comedy even less than straight man like dean martin or bud abbott would have jay has to be the comic he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair so jay and silent bob are long way from being successful comic team their starring roles and the low humor make this comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before sometimes just minutes before like dogma before it but definitely not like chasing amy this film feels more like an amateurish skit than real movie certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving they are excuses for gags many of which still fall flat it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content the film does not offer much to an adult audience rate it on the to 10 scale and low on the to +4 scale
the previews for the movie are pretty good they show little plot all the characters and the emotional highlights all spliced together to give general impression of the script unfortunately the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes the residents of mystery love hockey mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit player who guilty of shooting another man yes that one of the movie jokes every saturday the best players pair off for game and the whole town comes to watch the town prodigal son charlie hank azaria wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated mystery national fame has the town abuzz week later charlie actually shows up in person and he brings with him an offer from the nhl the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals the mysterians see this as both good and bad on the one hand they love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition on the other hand they don want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes the movie follows handful of lives that are affected by the proposition biebe russell crowe has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys including his new replacement he already resentful and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife crowe is not given lot of room to act in this film so he just kind of stuck with constantly brooding charlie meanwhile is resentful of having born in town where hockey is the only measure of man worth his gift of the feature story and of the new york rangers was his way of compensating for not being better skater he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter the judge whose courtroom was befouled by moronic jury of hockey fans walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey but he actively tries to put it behind him he wants his son to take the game more seriously but he wants his community to just get over it reynolds could have been good but sloppy writing and or editing keep walter in the corner and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together one character actually was interesting biebe wife mary mccormack like the judge understood that there was more to life than hockey but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open her unique insight is verbalized once and it lasts only scene before it is gone but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom mysterty alaska follows handful of other characters but none are well developed or worth mentioning the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story no underlying thing that the movie is really about instead roach and screenwriters david kelley and sean byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy they try to make you laugh and cry to feel outrage and pride they present the framing and cadence for jokes but there nothing truly funny they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness but they give you nothing to be really sad about as columnist molly ivins would say it all hat no cattle the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about there is funeral scene played with appropriate gravity and somber music it is chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what truly important russell crowe steps forward to speak about to spell out the movie metaphor for us he says that what really matters in life is community then adds and hockey guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear only mildly bad mystery alaska probably deserves stars even laughed out loud genuine laughs in places but docked it an extra half star when mike myers friend of roach turned up in role that didn suit him myers is comic character actor he puts on masks becomes an outrageous caricature and is funny he great as austin powers dr evil or any of his scottish characters nobody else in mysterty alaska is comic caricature all the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi serious roles for roach to bring in myers for few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast toward his audience and indeed toward the film itself it an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously
suave cool collected rich uptight bad guy cliche clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs cliche bad guy who owns wild animal cliche crooked chauvinistic law enforcer type cliche at an intense moment our main character tries to get away but the car has trouble starting cliche complaining about cliches cliche ok ok so we always hear about cliches but if there was ever to be prime example the real mccoy is it not one uttered word not one frame of film not one character in this whole movie isn cut and paste example of everything we ve ever seen they might as well use this as training film how to make bank robbery film in the 90 karen mccoy kim basinger is bank robber who just got out on parole after six year stay at the state prison she wants to make things right and go straight especially with the fact that she has six year old son out there who doesn even know she alive aware of mccoy bank robbing expertise sniveling bad guy jack schmidt terence stamp uses the same six year old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18+ million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier which by the way is somehow due to schmidt and if she refuses who knows what he ll do to the kid cue sinister laughter this movie is so pathetically pitiful that it hard to know where to begin the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant can stress enough how every single element whether it be character the dialogue plot twist etc is so damn generic that you ll wonder if anyone is working behind the scenes let alone in front of the camera basinger is absolutely vacant and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her here someone that spent their time robbing banks and now as she heads onto the street we re supposed to feel sorry for her as she confronts her son who doesn even know who she is are we supposed to break into tears especially when neither basinger nor zach english who plays the kid has any depth or emotional radiance whatsoever suppose should mention val kilmer yeah that right he in it quite sadly too seeing as how can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name and he got second billing to be fair will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe barker unfortunately the script doesn allow much room for improvement and when his character is used like bookends he never shows up in the middle of the film we have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project the real mccoy just can keep it head above water and soon very soon sinks into cliched mess of movie the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer and the dialogue particularly schmidt trite dialogue falls like the niagra this is definitely one to avoid folks the real mccoy is anything but
ironically one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life unfortunately will no longer be able to say that lived every moment of my life to the fullest because spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes watching this sad excuse for movie actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie not only is it pathetically bad film overall but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever the plot is scattered thin and predictable the acting is monumentally bad and the style of film making resembles home video it is december 31 1981 and the big party is at monica martha plimpton house but no one has arrived yet her invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica and some are total strangers but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night end those who are invited are the ones that have the issues it is up to those who aren to help them come to terms first there is eric brian mccardie who is former boyfriend of monica and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance or lack thereof he is one of the most bland characters in film full of dullness because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical common trait of this poor production bridget nicole parker and caitlyn angela featherstone who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year eve and tag along to the party with them they stumble across nameless bartender ben affleck who is the one truly perfect character in film of imperfections he is nether sexually deprived nor uncertain about his future as he is in law school his lack of flaws is both boring unrealistic and painful to watch as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub standard comedy moving on there is val christina ricci and stephie gabby hoffman teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts val is monica cousin and true fan of the new york scene on the other hand stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can find paradoxically it is punks that they meet at bar actually they attempt to flee from their presence but aren successful who guide them through their fears and force level of relaxation upon their warped minds of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples only one approaches level of decency in both acting and plot wisely the movie creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy courtney love and kevin paul rudd who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie janeane garofalo and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship however the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening finally there are the two worst performances and worst sub plot of the film jack jay mohr and cindy kate hudson have been going out for short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy virginity the night before while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self he is predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy very often when film is as putrid as this production there will at least be decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory however this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted instead what you get is collection of rough and inconsistent cuts bad continuity and inaccuracies first and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another there is no apparent order that it follows and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot at other times objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot there are also at least scenes in taxi cab that go from start to finish not in single one of them does anybody pay the driver and yet no matter how miserable this film may be and no matter how poor the acting is all around there was ray of hope for these many bad plots perhaps if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or perhaps even three there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development or quality acting or even decent plot payoff at the end but it didn happen that way the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into mediocre performance and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight
don get me wrong tend to appreciate besson naive unashamedly romantic worldview an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and young natalie portman and 1997 the fifth element is goofy paean to love that even more of hoot on repeated viewings but his joan of arc is mess despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of close cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself jovovich besson own personal muse through the making of his last two films though they ve since separated is magnetic and energetic enough to play credible joan as long as you believe joan was not just warrior but also fabulous supermodel level babe and besson remains servicable action film director though not an especially facile one leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english joan struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring and besson helps you understand how the french could believe fervently that god is on her side besson big mistake think is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject yes joan had visions but guarantee that whatever image sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue eyed christ figure on display in besson hallucinatory dream sequences the whole conceit turns into disaster right about the time dustin hoffman billed as the conscience shows up spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell babbling like ally mcbeal that kind of shame since she does quite well up to that point charging into battle with banshee wail that suggests the eruption of sublimated bloodthirstiness that darkly attractive aspect of her character that she as likely charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord is more or less betrayed by the final reels in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing she overseen and joan starts to look like little more than very confused young lady who about to take fall as the story winds down with joan condemned to horrible death by fire besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance trouble is he chosen lurid often jokey tone for the balance of the picture including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes and it impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is to great extent nothing more than put on this glib pre fab version of such great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer the passion of joan of arc 1928 film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan trial and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema compared to that film the messenger plays as crime against history directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich france usa 1999 theatrical aspect ratio 35

it shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying osmosis jones is crude gross disgusting and was directed by the farrelly brothers the twisted siblings behind there something about mary me myself and irene and couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt not that there anything wrong with scatology bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor such as it was it merely that with osmosis jones the farrellys humor is too juvenile too predictable you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy sequence is drawn osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho the trouble is the animation may please the very young but the jokes may be over their heads while the teen age audience may find it too tame for their tastes adults well let just say most will find it unappetizing osmosis jones plays like 100 minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby the live action sequences revolve around frank bill murray who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe he continually looks as if he needs shave and shower frank much to the consternation of his daughter is fast food addict eating anything and everything that can kill you he works at zoo where the animals look cleaner and presumably smell better than he does frank body is invaded by thrax lethal virus after frank eats hard boiled egg that had fallen to the ground it not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth nope the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle chimp for the egg wresting it from the primate mouth like said the gross meter tips the scales on this one after ingesting the egg the movie begins its animated sequences here osmosis jones voiced by chris rock renegade beyaz blood cell is teamed with drix voiced by frasier david hyde pierce 12 hour painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne basically what we have is cliched cop buddy movie rife with all the clich of that genre and this is why osmosis jones doesn click it merely falls back on tired familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations the jokes and puns are lame osmosis searches out snitch former flu virus after pumping him for information drix tells osmosis funny he doesn look fluish and the jokes don rise above that level the live action scenes are no better frank is such slob so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired child he almost bigger cartoon than the animated characters osmosis jones is movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left the animation is rather two dimensional and flat it lacks scope and depth it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head and maybe leaning toward shower after you walk out of the theater
has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plot driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs in enemy of the state that is exactly right few parts the net and few parts conspiracy theory enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997 lame brained men in siyah will this guy ever get real role he has the bruce willis syndrome the plot is bascially smith playing lawyer getting into hot water with some high government murderers who assassinated powerful political figure earlier in the movie when tape of the killing gets into his hands he inlists the help of an old conspirator hackman and at the end er you know enemy was one of the worst films of last year not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven and didn like how smith always magically out smarted the badies when all the other extra characters seeming more intelligent than smith somehow got run over by truck enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek insurrection know these two films are different in well everything but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me somehow quality can overshadow quantity
vegas vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly angelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family as with the other three films their two children rusty and audrey are played by revolving series of actors this time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles also back is cousin eddie randy quaid the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes in vegas vacation clark griswold chase decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen angelo can renew their wedding vows it is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue apparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they wouldn bother to write any jokes into the script at least that the way it looks when watching this turkey about half way through vegas vacation began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be single laugh in the entire film since there had been none up to that point by the end of the movie had actually snickered couple of times and had smiled at couple of gags might add that none of the funny and use the term loosely moments came as result of anything chase angelo or quaid were involved in they might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film the two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids who manage to have couple of their own adventures rusty becomes vegas high roller providing most of the film best moments every time chase and quaid were involved in gag it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film which brings me to the best moment of the film the griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road the theme from the original vacation begins to play christie brinkley and her kirmizi ferrari also from the first movie drive by it was cute moment but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been and just how far that this series has fallen too bad
burnt money is the perfect festival film it will show once or twice and then no one thankfully will ever have to hear from it again this film from the seattle international film festival 2001 emerging masters series is easily one of the year worst billed as gay `bonnie and clyde this gritty film from director marcelo pi eyro has its only highlight in well designed title sequence two gay lovers get involved in bank robbery that makes gang leader whose plan they screwed up angry this causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys one of whom may not actually be gay hiding out in prostitute apartment the two men must fight off police and gang members in very long showdown for the movie conclusion if caught they risk losing all the money and their love as an added emotional bonus one of the gay men is dying or something like that everything that happens is so quick and confusing was completely lost clarity isn exactly this movie striving virtue so it was little hard to pick up not much could have really happened though the main events in this long two hour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex graphic drug use extreme violence and strong language lots of explicit material is never bad thing when there reason but there no purpose to anything in this film most of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing it appears pi eyro who co wrote with marcelo figueras from novel by ricardo piglia purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement he makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible makes them snort cocaine gives them guns and condoms and lets them go burnt money is pointless the performances are bad it tries to thrill and shock but only causes boredom god forbid it will ever get distributor another disappointing film from this year so called emerging masters series pass on by
claire danes giovanni ribisi and omar epps make likable trio of protagonists but they re just about the only palatable element of the mod squad lame brained big screen version of the 70s tv show the story has all the originality of block of wood well it would if you could decipher it the characters are all blank slates and scott silver perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come by sheer force of talent the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they re on screen but the mod squad is just second rate action picture with first rate cast
the haunting film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of horror film to scare us if you ve ever seen movie which you probably have considering you are on this website you should know about all of the trivia they post before movie they have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film but the one always like are the &quot other name&quot joke that try and rename particular film for instance the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film small soldiers they had titles like little infantry and can get those fatigues in smaller size well after seeing the haunting had few particular names for it as well unfortunately can only post one of them otherwise be getting some pretty angry mails from overprotective mothers that title would be the confusing ok that is pretty bad title but it fits this film perfectly it basically serves up no purpose and combined with dry dialogue and boring and confusing plot it completes the formula for cinematic bomb liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in film without any depth but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth the haunting is nothing but trash but unfortunately will still make boatload of money before rant and rave about how bad this film is let me point out the few and stress the word few bright spots in this film first the house is great looking it looks beautiful but this is also dark spot it looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it this is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film things look so great that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie the hill house is not eerie it is beautiful but not the least bit frightening ever heard of lili taylor before this film did not but am glad that do now she gives the only satisfactory performance in the film despite the dry dialogue and boring confusing concept she manages to light up the screen every time she appears but unfortunately her co stars are usually following right behind owen wilson who plays luke is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance other then taylor he is basically there for the comic relief and his character development is poor in all other areas all of the characters are desperately underdeveloped wilson had potential as luke but it seems they just needed him to add few laughs liam neeson and catherine zeta jones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film their characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot they just are not believable and this is the final nail in the haunting coffin the plot is terrible the opening scene of the film is very important but the director makes it too obvious by getting close ups of all the things that will play major role in the end of the film as sat through the film kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish nell lili taylor character goes from the hunted to the savior it makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film he forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any in depth information for instance the beginning of the film gives us sense of why nell is getting involved in the program but we get zilch for the other four plus two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes and the worst part most horror films have killings for some reason they kill off luke at the end of the film no reason whatsoever just off with his head literally overall the haunting is the epitome of bad movie bad plot confusing storyline and waste of good talent hopefully liam neeson can rebound and get into good film and be used to his full potential hopefully lili taylor will be recognized for doing such great job in such bad film and hopefully other horror films such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house will not be as bad as this one
in 1989 director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama glory but since then he has made continuous disappointments to me at least with 1994 legends of the fall and 1996 courage under fire those two films weren bad just not very good but with zwick latest film the siege he has finally made one the siege is modern day action thriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city investigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard denzel washington and frank haddad tony shalhoub who are first hit by the ordeal when city bus explodes with several innocent people on it later bomb goes off in broadway theater killing even more they soon meet cia operative elise kraft annette bening who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist there are some movies that simply don need to be made and the siege may very well be one of them oh sure zwick thinks he is making meaningful action film since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than say die hard which also starred bruce willis this time willis is horribly wasted as general of the army who puts state of martial law over nyc during the climax whatever points the siege earnestly tried to make were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen or maybe zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place the role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical just as women were in the recent john caprenter vampires by placing them all in the category of bad guys the siege contains three fine actors washington bening and shalhoub but washington is stuck with character that contains not an ounce of even remote development bening has slightly more to do and has an intriguing character to work with while shalhoub pretty much steals the show even though again he has no real character by the climax of the siege with washington giving sermon to willis on the so called message of the story felt like had wandered into sequel to on deadly ground in which steven seagal gave 10 minute speech at the end about preserving the environment the siege is constantly heavy handed not entertaining or insightful and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save film that lacks satisfactory screenplay
guess that if very wild bachelor party had gone really bad there would be broken furniture traces of smack and cocaine on the floor and dead prostitute in the bathroom guess that if movie had also gone really bad there might be the same elements present coincidence poor kyle meek looking jon favreau he is about to marry his radiant fiancee laura cameron diaz but before he exchanges his vows he embarks to las vegas with his friends for one last blowout but this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly get the prostitute has met horrible though accidental death and drugs are everywhere the five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them to jail for very long time surprisingly calm robert boyd christian slater who looks like he was groomed to make nefarious decisions ponders their dilemma for few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the body in the desert where she ll never be found although they stomach the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body which also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it into suitcases when they return from their trip guilt and paranoia begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends one is adam daniel stern he grows increasingly agitated whenever people look at his van or whenever cop glances his way his blood pressure increases or that just may be because of his dysfunctional family another is michael who was actually responsible for her death he tries to bury his feelings but the burden of guilt begins to affect his judgment as well boyd is the doer of the group seemingly suffering from long psychosis when he feels as if his secret is about to be exposed he is apt to take extreme measures to cover up his tracks kyle just hopes that his wedding will live up to laura demanding expectations then there moore leland orser who speaks lines and walks around with puzzled look on his face the problem with this reprehensible movie is that it wants to be cruel comedy but it presents things in manner that just aren funny drugs mutilation and killing your own friends isn something to be laughed at as straight psychological drama could see how it might have worked as each one tried to maneuver and overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimes sick ways but this movie insults us by assuming that we could simply discard our values for hours if you do like this movie don think that want to know you did find slater convincing leader who sways his friends to choose not the right thing but the smart play and diaz adds some brightness to this film as wedding needing fiancee but her talents are essentially wasted here it obvious that the film maker is trying to strike certain tone but the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless do not make very bad decision by seeing this film
had been looking forward to this film since heard about it early last year when matthew perry had just signed on big fan of perry subtle sense of humor and in addition think chris farley on edge extreme acting was riot so naturally when the trailer for almost heroes hit theaters almost jumped up and down soda in hand the lights dimming was ready to be blown away by farley final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry big breakthrough was ready to be just amazed for this to be among farley best in spite of david spade absence was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran sadly none of this came to pass the humor is spotty at best with good moments and laughable one liners few and far between perry and farley have no chemistry the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade for it his type of humor and not at all what perry is associated with and the movie tries to be smart subject best left alone when it farley flick the movie is major dissapointment with only few scenes worth first look let alone second perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie and not surprisingly the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley and farley classic humor is widespread too almost heroes almost works but misses the wagon train by quite longshot guys let leave the exploring to lewis and clark huh stick to tommy boy and we ll all be friends
the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride and it sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics both siskel and ebert sighting it more than month ago as one of the year finest films so naturally when entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found this notion left me puzzled it is rare thing for children movie to be praised this highly so wouldn you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly magical piece of work tad bewildered but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with very open mind having great expectations for the film looking back should have taken the hint and left right when entered the theater believe me wanted to like babe pig in the city the plot seemed interesting enough after the events that took place in the original babe the sheep pig has become legitimate national phenomenon but after fateful encounter with water well arthur hogget james cromwell who the movie could have used alot more of has been rendered bed ridden for number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially the only solution that his wife magda szubanski going from delightfully charming to downright annoying can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at national fair think and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public problem is the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded city completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion setting the main plot in motion mrs hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright here is where the film took wrong turn up until this point had being having rather enjoyable experience the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs hogget is accused of smuggling drugs unfortunately the story wears thin as we are introduced to new set of animals that reside at the hotel none of them being even one tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe the main topic of discussion surrounding babe pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children and believe it is at one point dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown at other times we are treated to surrealistic flash backs to mrs hogget full cavity search at the airport in fact the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing however that is as they say neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway the animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and half let alone entertain child another problem found with the film was it sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story if you re going to make darker and more sinister sequel fine it may not be my cup of tea but at least it is noble ambition but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of sudden have slapstick finale with mrs hogget swinging from wall to wall of ballroom in elastic overalls it just didn feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining and the same goes for the rest of the movie
to put it bluntly ed wood would have been proud of this totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor hokey drama zero logic and crap screenplay also beautifully anti climactic ending not to say it didn look intriguing when saw the previews so much for truth in advertising roland emmerich who later independence day would look like the 400 blows compared to this co writed and directed this inane sci fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens in useless opening sequence men find stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it it wouldn be till present day 94 till they would actually figure it out they re decipherer slightly neurotic scientist nice twist dr dan jackson james spader doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare who life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word why do they use him to decipher what no one else could so there is hokey ending duh he figures it out in about minute yea and then they get suicidal colonel or something jack neill kurt russel with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then flat top that would make howie long snap into fetal position why suicidal colonel for the ending you ll get the hang of this they open the stargate bunch of them go through it with bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad after an overdone special effects thing they re inside goddam pyramid so they went to egypt right wrong they re on another planet that was filmed in egypt they discover cilvilization ruled by ra the sun god the androginous jaye davidson with voice modifier to make him sound like barry beyaz with asthma and there are fights explosions and kiss between two people yea also melodrama stupidity hokey scenes and bizarre language an anti climactic ending ends with stupid lines say hello to king tut asswhole the quintessential line lemme tell ya and some convenient pesudo pseudo pseudo character development by the end you just wanna go home and watch don know the outer limits or something the script terrible the special effects are okay but nothing great the story so weak that it almost opaque the whole experience just isn worth it unless you re so bored that you consider watching full house marathon or this pick this obviously but still it just not fun at all and can wait for it to premier on mst3k
wonder if budget is at all criterion for whether or not movie can be considered an exploitation flick take the professional for example it boasts extremely glossy cinematography couple of recognizable name actors and couple of fairly impressive explosions it also basically about violence and cheap titilation and features central relationship between middle aged man and twelve year old girl with decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension the professional is all over the map and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant the professional of the title is new york hit man named leon jean reno brutally efficient but also very isolated one day he is forced to let someone into his life when girl from his apartment building knocks on his door her name is matilda natalie portman and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired agent norman stansfield gary oldman after matilda father tried to rip him off leon reluctantly takes matilda in then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother the two become closer which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much and sets out to eliminate them both writer director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita slick potboiler about female assassin there is no question that besson can make great looking film with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast he has created film chock full of moody close ups and evocative lighting but beneath the shiny wrapper there isn nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given character to develop leon is mostly collection of quirky traits all intended to show us that for hired killer he really not so bad guy he drinks lots of milk takes meticulous care of potted plant and enjoys gene kelly movies jean reno succeeds at giving leon haunted and desperate quality but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda natalie portman is all wrong for part that called for much grittier quality but she doesn have too much to work with either besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place as is scene where matilda shocks hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover character is thoroughly sacrificed for cheap gag gary oldman entire part is something of cheap gag wild eyed and way over the top but at least he is interesting to watch there isn real person to be found anywhere in the professional which isn always problem in an action thriller except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of twelve year old in really distasteful way there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda relationship confront it head on or ignore it entirely but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he going to show them forbidden love story while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching child to load 9mm pistol or the blood which is spilled aplenty great deal of the time the professional is just plain sleazy and all the soft filters in the world can disguise that fact
one of these days ll make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie king of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding and bad lieutenant is only fit for single emotive viewing his exploitation flicks have fallen into rut of hoary art house trappings it perfume drenched coke addled visit to the seedy pornography shop where beautiful models no hookers no courtesans usher you through the silk curtains ferrara only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again since walken can make good movie great and loathsome movie durable whenever he onscreen his minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal unwatchable and pretentious failure when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch there much needed dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair you know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know they re actually having fun the addiction is that movie walken sadly does not appear in the blackout the central role of matty junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction is played by matthew modine who takes what he can get after cutthroat island much like the protagonists of michelangelo antonioni terminally bored cultural elite matty is involved in bitter pill relationship with high fashioned model annie at least think she model matty lady is played by french actress atrice dalle arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout not that you needed to know that but it lends credence to the idea that ferrara entire oeuvre has been filmed in fucking blackout no kidding requiem for dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara movies and his controversial urban lifestyle matty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him no doubt he was off chasing the dragon in his despair matty indulges in chemical induced weekend of debauchery tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne dennis hopper in full dirty ol man mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs wider toward the end of the night they pick up teenage waitress also named annie sarah lassez start shooting hastily improvised sexual scene then matty thankfully blacks out something happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie and it exactly what you think it was suffice to say there some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two or anyone at all the blackout is typical ferrara no plot to speak of plenty of raunch and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing bottle of jack daniels and beer while wrapping himself in see through curtain in his hotel room by the sea by the sea by the beautiful sea cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docu style sleaze and we re back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits yeah yeah arrrghhh says mr hopper dirty old sod it compulsive viewing in tacky sort of way leading to ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny how that for cryptic never fear ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what he all about can picture it now take off yer clothes kid it essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist and you re his visual id you re the soul the heart the bloodstream of the picture take it off take it all off ha ha ha friggin vampire yeah you ferrara final word about matthew modine he actually fine actor when properly cast but there something too squeaky clean in his demeanor he ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the time bomb nebbish in short cuts who is every bit as superb as julianne moore in that famous scene though no one seems to notice him [he was in that scene ed here he asked to let it all hang out sporting three day stubble and oily bangs he throws around furniture like stanley kowalski but it somehow lacking modine lacks the feral intensity of brando entirely miscast in ferrara flesh fair better luck next time matt someday you ll be forgiven for cutthroat island which wasn really your fault in the first place maybe atom egoyan will find place for you somewhere and all will once again be well in your world
making your first feature film ain easy assemble decent if not strong cast as writer director robert moresco has done with one eyed king and you re already ahead of the game but rehash old plot lines tired dialogue and standard clich and well intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at second feature film how many more movies do we need about rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade filmmaker from making yet another but here we have it again five irish kids in nyc hell kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop with teary music and slow motion in the film first scene the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as good hearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah blah blah but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points he concerned about buddy jason gedrick heroin abuse he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin character sister he looks into who might be pushing the most moronic looking counterfeit cash ever made genuinely funny touch but none of this ever really amounts to anything it seems that moresco greater concern is to provide that intangible slice of life that flavor of the neighborhood that everyone been trying to evoke since scorsese early work so we get the drunk guys hugging and singing together at the local bar to prove to us that they really love each other do people actually do this we get lot of tough street talk usually mumbled for effect and whole lot of the word whether it sounds like it fits or not we also get handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose bruno kirby chazz palminteri you know guys you ve seen in movies just like this one before assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears and baldwin performance is adequate but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that it almost funny moresco theater guy and sometimes tv writer including the series falcone obviously labored over this one as anyone might first child but the content is probably too personal as result the movie style is heavy handed in need of considerable amount of toning down nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids moresco reminds us boy does he remind us with slow dissolves to the earlier scene running in slow motion complete with dialogue from the present just in case we don comprehend the link to the past moresco needs to either trust his audience intelligence or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it his next project should have little more personal distance and lot more subtlety if he actually gets that chance reviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage feature story coming soon
easely one of the worst films of the year with the millenium just around the corner hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil the result is somewhat predictable didn have high hopes about arnold much anticipated return to the big screen schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased action lovers won be bored and the catholic league will be angry everyone else will see end of days for what it is deliciously bad motion picture think of it as hollywood own y2k bug did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you ll get 999 as in 1999 yes you better believe it satan is here on earth working on his latest project the end of days this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and although not al pacino he is fun to behold he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker wreaking as they say havoc the way it works is he smirks and something explodes before the stroke of the new millennium he got to find and impregnate certain woman in order to climb out from under heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations only schwarzenegger cop attached to an anti terrorist unit can stop him films like this has one serious weakness logic no matter how you twist the plot you ll find it incredibly stupid even for schwartzenegger movie the incredible fact is that such directors never learn after thousands of headless productions this theme has become one big clich here the devil looks more like sex addicted maniac that has just got out of mental institution he is walking around blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in meter radius all he wants is the girl that is somehow special but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks he has hidden her in church where satan dare not enter so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information you can have your wife and daughter back can give you happiness that you can only dream of just give me the address indeed with script like that you could make wonderful parody but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously attempting to create provoking an dramatic thriller and for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger comeback will not be very satisfied we ve not seen him in while that because he didn have worthy opponent he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop so after all those fights what left for arnold schwarzenegger how about satan in my opinion he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron terminator and that is schwartzenegger strength muscles and no emotions here he tries to achieve an artistic level moving towards the oscar this is called an adult turn if successful and flop if unsuccessful make wild guess his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems this requires at least some acting skills regrettably the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles the rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters the movie is otherwise technically impressive with solid cinematography and fine lighting but the movie doesn serve neither as serious thriller because of its stupidity nor as comic entertainment because of its serious tone the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry the action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular so really have hard time recommending this film to somebody unless you are die hard schwartzenegger fan stay away as for schwarzenegger he ll be back
these days people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run 1970s nostalgia is already wearing off and now people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s few years in the future early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia however doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon loaded weapon that in many ways symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry lack of originality and ideas being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series this film pairs two policemen jack colt emilio estevez burn out alcoholic cop on the edge and wes luger samuel jackson by the book policeman days away from retirement two of them following the murder of luger ex partner must confront evil general mortars william shatner crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies the authors of this films whose director gene quintano worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects and that reflects in the lack plot characters and even original lines the plot or what goes for the plot in this movie is nothing more than series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years apart from lethal weapon series this film borrows its female lead from basic instinct the best gags are same as with many other similar movies shown in the trailers the rest simply doesn work only those who used to watch lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh others would probably wince at the lameness of humour some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in while but at the end spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of movie is simply not worth the effort the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of series that already had strong comic overtones the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon joke in their fourth sequel
paul verhoeven the dutch auteur who dragged his violent sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film has never been what consider thoughtful director though some of his films notably starship troopers have been lauded as artistic achievements but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who managed to no matter what the budget make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils starship troopers was essentially monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange great film that nearly impossible to find on video yet showgirls is everywhere in which he cast troop of stunningly attractive mannequins the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards who may actually be 45% silicone in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage it not completely successful film but as failure it certainly an interesting and mostly entertaining one my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores spetters dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange haven yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight believe his best hollywood film to be robocop bleak super hero satire with robotic hero that as touching as schwarzenegger in t2 that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics its violence seemed to be there for purpose namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience there jaw dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with cop before snuffing him he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim every fearful tic it startling moment of barbaric maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk noir in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays dog because it just won shut up he impales co worker drowns another and so on but why his character is introduced as smug genius the kind who always impeccably dressed and races sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear sort of like scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place though once the character becomes invisible this film has him pull 180 shift into psychotic movie monster the kind who just won die hollow man protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda elizabeth shue acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm and her lover hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who saddled with the film worst lines ve lost cohesion again they re typical aaron spelling couple good looking but as vacant as george bush republican national convention speech bush referring to clinton so much promise but to what end to what end this actually got applause suddenly warren beatty doesn look so absurd the rest of the film characters are all well past thirty though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with series of strained one liners is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood new character developing technique ahh what cynical time we live in as the picture opens we meet cain kevin bacon an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on top secret so top secret the government has only provided them with dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation project with the goal to make invisibility possibility for what purpose is never hinted at they ve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine in twist worthy of the film 1950 late show origins to impulsively experiment on himself caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead our mad scientist is turned invisible after several fx heavy complications then he inexplicably it hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures but this is never explored and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on human begins raping assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases always with lame wisecrack ready la freddy krueger it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it verhoeven films that have become hollow like the rest this one is cold heartless and full of contempt for humanity but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit insight and makes no statement other than audiences will pay for anything these days it an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level or even those hoping to spend saturday night with fun thrill minute ride verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick how can one not have good time at film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self couple weeks ago after seeing the trailer bunch of friends and got into long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa in serious manner to boot but oh yeah it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway verhoeven delivers the sleazy goods but not in watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner here it just feels icky and uncomfortable the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux psycho music strains in the background it plainly obvious that verhoeven isn exploring voyeurism like in the classic peeping tom but exploiting it and not even doing that very well it funny that with all the technology $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show woman naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks in fact it largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since by the end most of his potential victims don infer red glasses that track his body heat as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked the film only provides one moment that found genuinely creepy it happens when lab assistant kim dickens who looks like she stepped out of playboy in the middle of chit chat with an invisible bacon suddenly pauses are you looking at me she queries obviously haunted it little moment in big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to plot that should have run its course by 1982 the apex of the mad slasher craze those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or still know what you did last summer and they re the only reason to check out hollow man preferably as mid week bargain rental you ve been warned but you probably won listen will you tis pity
fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies but the quantity most of those movies were produced by cannon group company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman movie mentors of future hollywood legends unfortunately that didn happened and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal sadly for bronson that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead and lowering his own reputation in process on the other hand bronson could take comfort in fact that those movies were extremely popular especially among the audience or times younger than bronson himself one of such movies that seriously marred bronson reputation is death wish third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974 in the original movie bronson played paul kersey mild mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence that movie was far from masterpiece yet in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry unfortunately six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels even the presence of its original director didn stop the rapid decline of the quality death wish begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend living in the urban wasteland of east new york populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out before the reunion kersey friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker played by gavan herlihy probably the only noteworthy role in the film kersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade while the police inspector shriker ed lauter ants to use him as secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime bronson the main asset in this movie plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine although bronson charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities single man in his 60s and armed with single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower the lack of emotions or bronson own commitment could be seen in very few lines spoken in film the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness so they added romantic interest for their hero public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey crusade on the other hand emotions are much better played by confronting law abiding yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey unfortunately michael winner doesn know how to work out the plot and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations ends this movie with bang the big showdown at the end that turns east new york into the sarajevo like battle zone is probably the worst part of the movie because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget in short this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia special note for trekkies marina sirtis the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek the next generation could be spotted in small role of portorican wife
overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name based on shirley jackson novel the haunting of hill house stars lili taylor as one of three lab rats that participate in supposed insomnia study being initiated by liam neeson he is actually conducting study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it he drags the test subjects out to foreboding mansion where all types of creepy cgi effects scare the cast and try the audience patience know this question has been posed before but why do people keep remaking good movies the original was great psychological horror film this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary in fact feel it is downright impossible to make modern day pg 13 horror movie that is scary unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening then there nothing in this film that will raise hackles nearly fell asleep twice during the film and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didn seem to have such personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed it sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly owen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability catherine zeta jones always nice to look at is given the woefully underwritten role of bi sexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what going on as the rest of them do finally poor lili taylor the center of the film gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her apparently subplot involving tryst between zeta jones and taylor characters was filmed but removed that too bad because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative this is jan de bont second straight misfire speed cruise control being the first when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that one should not approach haunted house movie with twister mindset if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything it would have served to make the film terrifying what our mind fashions on it own can be thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything apparently yet another version of this story is being filmed under it original title certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bont version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had [pg 13]
tarzan and the lost city is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite while not only it is poorly written badly acted and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid unfortunately it not bad in the way great colossal misfires like heaven gate 1980 or ishtar 1987 were bad instead it literally drips off the screen like movie nobody wanted to be associated with which begs the question of why it was made in the first place with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un produced how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen of course tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history he has appeared in over forty films which have ranged from the very good 1984 greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes down to the really bad 1981 tarzan the ape man with bo derek most of these films were just cheapie movies made in the thirties and forties starring ex olympic athletes and lot of cutsie chimps therefore if another tarzan movie is to be made one might assume that it would have something new to offer different angle an original storyline anything to set it apart from all the others greystoke added never before seen level of realism to the pulpy tale and even tarzan the ape man at least had the mis guided audacity to sexualize the story as vehicle for bo derek bare breasts tarzan and the lost city on the other hand has absolutely nothing to offer but bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue the script by bayard johnson and anderson siyah is about as formulaic and generic as they come comic books have better plots than this the movie is so bad in fact that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer comedy george of the jungle didn the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established quick opening narration tells of tarzan casper van dien being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage when the movie starts in 1913 he is civilized english gentleman without an english accent and he is to marry jane jane march in less than week however when wicked archeologist grave robber named nigel ravens steve waddington begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar one of africa last great secrets the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle at first jane refuses to go pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape man once the film gets going in its own sluggish way it delves into series of jungle adventures as tarzan jane and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city most of the so called adventures are cheesy predictable and unexciting with no pace tension or action to speak of there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies ranging from raiders of the lost ark 1981 to the goonies 1985 when the movie is running short on action it includes few greenpeace friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals releasing baby elephant from trap and throwing ivory tusks into the river the movie is also lacking even remote hint of reality for instance when tarzan who was raised in the jungle is bit by cobra he doesn even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi experienced weekend backpacker would do instead he ties tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival of course one can help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is not to ruin the ending or anything but there is no lost city there is however lost pyramid which suppose is all the resource strapped fx department could come up with the special effects are not worthy of made for tv movie which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid when it sitting right out in the middle of an open field strictly speaking tarzan and the lost city isn even bad enough to have camp quality although casper van dien laughably stiff performance comes real close this movie proves what starship troopers only hinted at he cannot act but he sure looks well groomed even in the deepest heart of the african jungle van dien is much too much of pretty boy to be an effective tarzan he calvin klein model in loin cloth also wondered what the make up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa 1983 steve perry haircut waddington makes decent villain although he like charmless version of belloq from raiders of the lost ark as jane the ex model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan she does fire off gun at the evil treasure hunters time or two but whenever snake comes into the picture she is reduced to hysterical mess however amidst all this complaining do have one piece of good news tarzan and the lost city is so lacking in ideas both new and old that it is unable to fill even an hour and half of celluloid so we can say this much for it at least it had the decency to be short
everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence billy zane is wooden as the hero kristy swanson is given very little to do and does very little with it treat williams looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse is one of the worst villains have ever seen in movie only catherine zeta jones as one of williams cohorts turns in good performance she has energy and spunk which the movie needed much more of oh yeah the phantom also has secret identity but this is so poorly played out you won even care about the only things can recommend are good performance by jones and some colorful scenery however if youre looking for fun family movie go watch the underrated flipper this is not good movie
life less ordinary while the extremely peculiar life less ordinary does live up to its title more appropriate moniker would be movie more misguided for this confused confusing attempt at romantic comedy is most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle producer andrew macdonald and screenwriter john hodge at the core of this strange film is fairly basic and yes ordinary premise after robert boyle regular ewan mcgregor an aspiring writer of trashy novels is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation he kidnaps naville ian holm spoiled daughter celine cameron diaz and holds her for ransom the joke here is that celine is willing victim her father threatened to cut her off financially so she wants revenge and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme teaching the inept robert thing or two about kidnapping and ultimately didn we see this one coming love so far so mediocre but mediocre is better than dreadful which this film is thanks in no small part to the hodge contextual frame for the romance it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth so the chief of heaven police gabriel dan hedaya dispatches two angels reilly holly hunter and jackson delroy lindo to earth to hook up celine and robert or lose their angel status this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film as it stands it is simply waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand not that there is much of romance to begin with try as diaz and mcgregor may celine and robert are too one note to become very endearing characters celine is rich bitch robert is dullard as such it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two then again they never seem to really connect with each other when celine and robert start to overtly act on their feelings it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural but am not exactly sure if boyle and company point was romance honestly am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz but it remains just that energy not energy in service of story or even acting the cast seems lost especially hunter whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film some violent confrontations involving the angels who are not exactly angelic in fact they end up staging their own ransom scheme some mystical hokum in the climax and cutesy claymation epilogue watching much of life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell stockpiling quirks in the name of cool instead the film just gives quirky bad name my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic yes misspelling intended whimsy which comes through in only one scene an extended musical number where celine and robert sing beyond the sea at karaoke bar after verse or two the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos and engage in spirited dance routine on the counter the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard just relying on the innate charm of the leads allowing them to build romantic rapport alas not nearly enough is built for this moment comes to an abrupt end applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill life less ordinary certainly delivers something different but by the time the film was over was clamoring for life more ordinary can accept failure everyone fails at something but can accept not trying it doesn matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart michael jordan
how could rated disney film based on meg cabot novel the princess diaries be anything but cute harmless fun easy take all the cute harmless fun out of it and while you re at it make it borrr ring that what director garry marshall screenwriter gina wendkos and not to be outdone producer whitney houston have done with the rated disney film the princess diaries you couldn tell it from the audience though braintree mass of growing glowing pre pubescent girls and the odd parental popcorn perched about their persons who positively cheered when the end credits rolled ah the film had struck lovely nerve with them but not with fuddy duddy old me well might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over but that would have been too obvious too obvious is the least of the problems with marshall film garry made couple of other princess movies pretty woman and runaway bride but this one way without julia roberts so maybe that its problem in addition to being predictable as molasses the princess diaries has hardly got laugh in it it comedy could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long long stretches and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we haven even seen yet and probably never will except perhaps in the dvd edition marshall should take virtually all of the blame here since he been at this for some time and should know when scene or two isn working and hardly any of the princess diaries works works alas implies cleverness and there none of that here either newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall had bit of fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of the filmmakers go out of their way not to call it serbia which is pretty much what all miniscule european countries are called in the movies mark my words and now she mia is next in line to rule genovia hence the headphones tiara combo in the print ads julie andrews with the luminous factor cranked to 11 plays mia grandmother aka queen clarisse renaldi who shows up out of the royal mavi and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating talking and looking like princess department although mia big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of good laugh not really consuming corn dog is about the worst that it gets also on stereotypical hand are brainless jock an evil cheerleader dorky looking best friend welcome to the dollhouse heather matarazzo sensitive auto mechanic musician and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mia chauffeur driven limousine at every intersection non animated rated movie is rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts all the good stuff has been exorcised from the finished product lame labored and lamentable the princess diaries is recommended for eight and half year olds of the feminine persuasion only all others would do well to avoid it like potholes the plague and the perfect storm
the corruptor is big silly mess of an action movie complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence it not abhorrent or even blatantly unlikable but it doesn make shred of sense and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film james foley knows lot about characters and acting and those are the strengths of the corruptor but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense and the result is less like movie and more like derailed train at least we have chow yun fat in the lead role chow plays nick chen chinatown cop he good cop as the first few scenes establish and he very familiar with chinatown that probably why the powers that be decide to team him up with rookie named danny wallace mark wahlberg nick and danny begin by stepping on each other toes but finally end up liking each other once they both get chance to save the other one life what happens after that is kind of mystery to me fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons led by young chinese psycho named bobby vu byron mann also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ric young gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny although this makes for some ridiculous albeit unpredictable plot twists along the way there also an interesting subplot revolving around danny father brian cox but it doesn have much to do with the main story one of the problems as said is that the movie doesn make any sense don blame this entirely on foley because he obviously good director more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci script which doesn seem to be in tune to the way normal people act one scene early on had me particularly annoyed nick confronts his boss because he angry about his new beyaz partner he shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture and was thinking that would have fired him if he had done that to me in addition the film takes bite into race related issues and never develops them at all there are lot of scenes like this one and none of them are very coherent there also considerable language barrier given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents the plot itself never straightens out not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are or why henry lee is associated with them or what they do as group the corruptor is an action movie and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences the sequences aren bad but they re not new how many car chases through chinatown have you seen on that note how many chinatown cop movies have you seen one too many imagine foley strength is clearly in characterization and he does pretty good job here the scenes between nick and danny are very good and actually got feel for their characters bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together chow and wahlberg are both good actors chow is pro and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere but he still fun to watch also liked the subplot involving danny father brian cox performance is powerful and his character makes compelling moral compass for danny but the film ultimately fails mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly familiar action scenes complicated plot can be successful but the story needs to make sense when it over the corruptor never manages to make any sense it just keeps spinning out of control until finally there nothing left to hold on to
return to horror high wants to be couple different types of movies at once the film tells the story of low budget horror movie being filmed at the closed down crippen high school where group of serial murders took place five years before but what the cast and crew don know is that real killer maybe the same one that was never apprehended is going into action again on one level return to horror high is slasher movie and it is at this level that it works the best on watching the film which was made in 1987 couldn help but take notice that the killer costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in scream and scream on another level the film wants to be slapstick comedy and there are many hints of this throughout unfortunately most of these jokes fall flat and the last thing the film wants to be is behind the scenes look at an exploitation film being made the only problem is that while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made no cameras are shown filming it thus making it far more confusing than it had to be and to top it all off the twist ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous and plot holes you could drive winnebago through if you see the film or have seen it you ll know what mean the premise of return to horror high is admittedly pretty crafty and liked the atmosphere of the school which is where the whole thing takes place but director froehlich judging from this movie is an incompetent director except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene well come to think of it there is only one scene that is actually scary and it has to do with two actors being locked in room as the killer tries to break in but other than that two minute distraction return to horror high is certainly no great shake note look for george clooney in supporting role as one of the actors on the film and strangely enough he is the first character to get the ax literally
the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffany in which the audience is rooting for some sweet vulnerable irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo played by sook yin lee as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible alessa is young woman who happens to be brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild adam beach he sees that behind the facade that there is really sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating ben gets emotionally involved with alessa as alessa so delicately puts it we were bosom buddies now we re fuck buddies but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor the real problem with the film seems to be helen lee inability to decide what she wants to be saying she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa alessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients this appears to be high profile and well paid job we are supposed to care about alessa feelings but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father alessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint this is charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up double zero rate it on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale

for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking or what left of it in mainstream hollywood movie which are star vehicles are terrible things as rule the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of particular actor an actor might be chosen on the up and up to give him exposure or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him paycheck generally though the actor doesn matter and soldier the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers exemplifies this the picture lacks pizazz the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less russell plays todd human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought the movie lets us see this degenerate process but by the time the real plot starts we re into todd later years he about to be replaced by new breed of soldiers ones who instead of being trained from birth are genetically selected before birth the pride of this class caine 607 jason scott lee will be our villain and you know he the villain because he has staring contest with our hero near the movie start between the two leads less than full typed page of dialogue is spoken and it possible to imagine script which is ninety percent stage direction director paul anderson who helmed last year icy thriller event horizon doesn show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam todd upon being replaced is left to die on garbage planet but in order to stretch the running time out the villains return to the garbage planet on routine patrol and set the stage for the final firefight events are predictable from the time that the setups are made and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be todd fails to show physical superiority against caine in fact not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry it not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story and so the plot has very canned feeling about it the best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit and treat it as parody of typical action fare like universal soldier strict interpretation however reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style class or substance and by next year large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television
am continually amazed at movies like this that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on script as abysmal as this one is mind boggeling but it seems to happen lot nowadays wild wild west is beautifully filmed well acted and well directed piece of garbage and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault in short this movie is comedy without laughs so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal the high production values keep it from being total fiasco but it still pretty boring will smith stars as jim west an old western r&b variation of the james bond character west is teamed up with artemus gordon kevin kline and they re pretty much polar oppisites west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets gordon traditionally favors more pacifistic approach talk about deeply developed characters at any rate this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies none of which are funny the year is 1869 several top scientists have been abducted and the suspected culprit is disgruntled former confederate general bloodbath mcgrath ted levine president grant sends west and gordon to investigate there evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr arliss loveless kenneth branagh another disgruntled former confederate as it turns out loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon which he will use to conquer the united states go further with the plot but there isn any point this film narrative is little more than jumbled unfunny mess only laughed at couple of jokes and then only lightly there isn one truly uprorously funny moment in this film and that pretty disasterous when you consider that it primarily comedy as said the fault is totally that of the script when you consider their respective roles will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done the leads could ve been played samuel jackson and robert de niro and the film still would ve been awful no one and mean no one can make line like bye bye mr knife guy sound good still this film has lot going for it visually the set design is fantastic maybe even oscar worthy the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus who was also behind camera in martin scorsese brilliant goodfellas is absolutely stunning he lends the film much needed exciting comic bookish look won fault barry sonnenfeld either he does fine job of directing the proceedings but like the rest of the people involved with the film there really isn anything that he can do to correct its one major flaw despite being beautifully made wild wild west becomes quite boring after the half way point the appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does if wild wild west didn look so good it would be almost insufferable as it is it somewhat tolerable but not very entertaining it hurts to give such well made movie score this low but there isn anything much worse than an unfunny comedy
this talky terribly plotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux an ex new orleans cop who gets ensnared in murder mystery after light plane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat he and his wife annie kelly lynch rescue little salvadorian girl samantha lagpacan from the wreckage and that when the trouble begins the other major players include local drug lord eric roberts his scheming wife teri hatcher soused stripper mary stuart masterson and shady dea agent vondie curtis hall everyone knows everyone else and it makes for collective that curious but never compelling based on the book by james lee burke heaven prisoners is so badly plotted that entire scenes seem to be missing early on we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa later dave is reunited with drug abuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation huh the whole movie is like this perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf whatever the reason somebody should tell director phil joanou final analysis to recut this mess in its present form heaven prisoners runs only two hours plus change but it feels like four
spoiled rich kid kelley morse chris klein receives new mercedes for graduation present he and his buddies take it for joyride to small nearby town where he proceeds to torment the locals simply because he rich and they re not he ends up provoking jasper josh hartnett into race and as result the local gas station and diner are destroyed when they crash into it kelley is sentenced to rebuild the diner and has to live with jasper in spare room over his family barn jasper girlfriend sam leelee sobieski soon takes liking to kelley however despite the fact that it was her family diner that was destroyed and all kelley does is sit around sulk and smart off to the townspeople but when she sees him sweaty and shirtless that apparently all she needs to lose her feelings for jasper whose only fault seems to be perpetual case of hat hair so sobieski soon falls in love with kelley especially after the day she follows him through the woods and hears him giving his graduation speech which he was unable to deliver because he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people in the speech kelley quotes poem by robert frost which just so happens to be sam favorite poem as well awwwww soon they re frolicking around in the fields and for some reason waste no time letting people in town especially jasper best friend see them together kelley continues to make an ass of himself in town especially when he shows up at the town dance drunk and steaming because sam went with jasper kelley runs off and decides to leave town sam catches up to him at the bus station and he asks her to come to boston with him jasper shows up and tearfully confesses to sam just how much he loves her and sam without even breaking stride basically says see ya and takes off to boston with kelley here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from the start that by the time its fairly decent ending comes around its completely worthless chris klein and leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers and it because of their presence that watched this film in the first place however not long into the proceedings wanted to just reach into the film and strangle them both shouldn have such feelings towards people like but their characters are so infuriating that well trust me you ll feel the same way even though both of the lead male characters are usually in the wrong kelley is hands down the more unlikable of the two simply because his jerkish actions are calculated he intends to be jackass each and every time he does it jasper on the other hand only reacts to kelley provocations and afterwards comes across as being truly sorry for his impulsive actions but as in life nice guys finish last for the entire film we watch sam fall in love with the guy no one likes while the film only sympathetic character gets completely crushed then cancer subplot comes into play where things get even more infuriating if you can imagine that what things weren depressing enough for you mr screenwriter who greenlit this project who on earth thought this would entertain anyone perhaps if the film had been structured where kelley perhaps felt some remorse after he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people but even after he destroyed these people lives he continues to be snob to them and ruins one more for good measure here on earth is available on dvd from fox home entertainment it contains the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 85 and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions extras include jessica simpson music video for where you are commercial for the film soundtrack which by the way is the only good thing about the film the original theatrical trailer and five tv spots trailers for other fox releases anna and the king anywhere but here the beach drive me crazy ever after romeo juliet simply irresistible as well as that new fox promo touting their upcoming dvd releases that really enjoy the picture and sound quality on the disc are fine nothing that will challenge anyone audio video systems of course fans of this movie if any exist should enjoy the dvd release here on earth is not entertaining nor is it compelling no joy or entertainment value can be derived from any of the events of the film it is merely waste of time money and talent
all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos please raise your hands thank you for identifying yourselves now would you all please go away your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade and it shows no sign of abating any time soon it isn just the strobe light quality of your twenty cuts per minute editing or the numbing over use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised featuring the music of no it is kind of cynicism you have perfected banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of story if you include enough bells and whistles welcome to the club scott kalvert your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one dimensional serving only as the vehicle for performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as whole dicaprio stars as jim carroll the new york poet songwriter performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based as the film opens jim is budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey mark wahlberg pedro james madio and neutron patrick mcgaw one night jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine and shortly thereafter to heroin jim addiction to the drug starts him on downhill spiral as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach bruno kirby kicked out of his home by his mother lorraine bracco and drops out of school along with mickey and pedro jim becomes victim of the street living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as project for years but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as character was too unsympathetic and too much loner screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll posse resulting in jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic but now with equally unsympathetic friends as film the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as cautionary tale 100 minute long just say no public service announcement but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie jim is sort of jerk even before he becomes junkie but suppose that his pseudo sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be saw him simply as part of the bad crowd without character who changes in any appreciable way the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung out cohorts all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack director scott kalvert doesn have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work so he substitutes silly slow motion photography self consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing on only one occasion when steady pan around room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in are any of the gimmicks effective mostly they just draw attention to how hollow the story is they also don allow leonardo dicaprio performance to be as strong as it could have been for every impressive moment like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money there is scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors particularly fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex junkie who tries to help jim straighten out but kalvert won let character interaction define this story he wants to turn dicaprio into rock star shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting at isolate moments the basketball diaries is fine showcase for dicaprio talents far more frequently it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what long form velvet underground video might have looked like
depending on your degree of cinematic acumen last man standing is either prohibition era remake of akira kurosawa 1961 classic yojimbo prohibition era remake of sergio leone 1964 classic fistful of dollars prohibition era action drama with completely original story line new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category than in the other two combined much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself this time around the man with no name is played by bruce willis fellow with shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico by all appearances jericho is well on its way to becoming ghost town with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border one is headed by an irishman named doyle david patrick kelly the other is run by chicago connected italian mobster strozzi ned eisenberg calling himself john smith the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle side but smith allegiance is as uncertain as his name and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from plotting standpoint and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes cum bastardizations there is the happily ineffectual lawman bruce dern the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses affections karina lombard the barkeep who becomes our anti hero only friend william sanderson suspicious lieutenants christopher walken and michael imperioli to question the bosses trust in smith brutal beating and big fire director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids including pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity but at least he doesn try to turn the story into slasher film or buddy picture what he _does_ do is nearly as big mistake and that is to provide running voice over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard boiled style of pulp detective fiction yes that narration is full of cliches but those are are not particularly troubling the problem is that both yojimbo and fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters they were mystery to the other characters in the film and to the audience their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status with john smith voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought he becomes more mundane just another tough guy trying to stay alive it feels like hammett novel all right and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice but it simply doesn work the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence even if you walk into last man standing as blank slate can imagine it being much more than heavily armed minor distraction willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith but there is still level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else christopher walken plays doyle brutal henchman as slight variation on his gallery of soft spoken psychos and there isn another single character whom makes even the slightest impression with no compelling antagonist for smith there is no build up towards the expected showdown and when it does come that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about cinematographer lloyd ahern who also did the only noteworthy work on hill 1995 flop wild bill creates some nifty sunburned vistas but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter productive narration sometimes when someone sees lackluster remake of revered original they ll wonder what all the talk was about in the case of last man standing it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about
went to blair witch project book of shadows with the highest of hopes the original film released last summer was genuinely scary and terrifying hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor unfortunately my hopes were soon dashed as the movie opens the audience is shown pseudo documentary clips of burkittsville maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as result of the original blair witch project movie it mostly humorous self aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film during this segment we are introduced to the protagonist young man who sells blair witch related memorabilia from his website the movie then cuts to title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia but now he is confined in mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies we see him having some sort of disgusting beyaz goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while cigarette smoking doctor luridly leers above him we see him throwing himself wildly around padded room we see him cowering naked in shower stall as fire hose is turned on him no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution in fact these scenes are barely referred to again had sinking feeling during these opening scenes generally hospital scene that is set with poor lighting filthy interiors and evil doctors is sure sign that you are in the throes of truly horrible movie the movie cuts again this time to the present the young man whose name is jeffrey played by jeffrey donovan as in the first movie the character names are identical to the actors names although this movie admits up front that it is fictional so there no reason for the practice this time around is rounding up group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the blair witch hunt which is promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website we meet tristen and steven young couple who are writing book about the blair witch experience steven is skeptic believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria tristen on the other hand believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence she is wan and soft spoken she complains that the radio is playing too loudly she also complains that she feels nauseated knew immediately that the character was pregnant and my intuition was confirmed few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out how did know because in bad movies nauseated women are always pregnant the fourth member of their party is erica wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was good witch not evil they pick up the fifth and final team member in cemetery kim is dressed completely in siyah has extreme goth style makeup on and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect it never explained the party of five heads off into the woods as promised they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr house and set up camp complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night events there is brief encounter with rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well but after few words are exchanged the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere the movie veers off at this point to spend many long long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down sexual innuendoes are tossed around much hard liquor beer and pot is consumed and nothing much else happens this would be great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary the next day the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed and that steven and tristen manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds like snow the videotapes are missing but thanks to psychic intuition from kim they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house right where the original blair witch tapes were found ooh spooky the team goes back to jeffrey house creepy old civil war era warehouse in the heart of the woods to regroup and review the tapes they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night wacky hijinks ensue tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch everybody starts finding these weird rune like burn marks on their bodies steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations and everything pretty much goes to hell in handbasket throughout the entire ordeal jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps eventually tristen wanders in mutters something about reverse and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards when they do this they discover what really happened during the five lost hours one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes okay if the videotapes were being buried then how were they recording themselves oh nevermind this movie was awful simply awful the characters are broadly drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development erica is the nature loving wiccan tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman steven is the overbearing asshole kim is the antisocial goth girl old tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic because she pregnant how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl because she wears lot of eye makeup how do we know the local sheriff is bad guy because he has jagged teeth and talks like he straight out of deliverance this is weak storytelling at its worst rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic the writer chose to give each one few stereotypical characteristics in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action it didn work on top of being poorly developed most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid honey you just had miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at hospital that looks like it belongs in bad slasher movie let get on plane home no am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and want to find out what going on ok frankly by the end of the movie was rooting for the witch also felt that there was simply too much blood gore in this film the first movie worked by never showing us the horror the witch was palpable presence in that movie but we never saw it we never saw anything in fact the horror was all off screen and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be this is the hallmark of truly creepy and disturbing horror movie blair witch dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross out this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing beyaz goo down jeffrey throat and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be ritual massacre of some sort knives plunge into flesh bloody fingers trail off into the darkness and none of it is explained until the very end when it was too late for me to care this movie didn stop with showing us the gore either it went for broke and showed us everything by the end of the movie there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours it is all explained in fact it is all shown on screen in loving detail confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster or see only brief glimpses mere suggestions of what the monster is it is not because find the monster so terrifying but because find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no monster that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind found this to be miserably poor explanation if it was in fact the director intent then he needs to have some words with the writer because it was not made clear at all know lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds none of them has ever gone on murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with group of other people for the next week or so and if there was no witch then what about the vanishing tree the snowfall of manuscript paper hm blair witch book of shadows was horrible movie from the poorly written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross out shots it was bad effort through and through
giving this stinker normally the worst that would ever rate movie would be but the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive helped me come to the big goose egg not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing or if he was even thinking at all maybe in mel little mind horse being knocked unconscious because of punch to the face is funny in mine it not or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking because only the self righteous lee uses the word more often in his films than brooks did in this one at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it wrong mel would call you boob mel but that insults breasts everywhere this idiotic attempt at comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governor harvey korman attempts to clear out town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out but the town appeals to the governor mel brooks in one of many uninspired and unfunny roles to send them new sheriff to protect them the governor pawns the task off to korman character hedley lamarr can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name lamarr decides to send the town siyah sheriff gasp in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of siyah man living among them that they will all just leave hold on ve got to stop while these gales of laughter pass it just too funny racism passing as humor gosh why didn anybody ever think of that one before oh wait think somebody might have they are called the kkk not calling brooks racist but am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldn know what was funny if it hit him over the head but digress anyway the siyah sheriff rides into town amid flurry of townsfolk using the word golly will the hilarity just never end he ends up joining forces with drunk gene wilder who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west together they save the day from evil not one person in this movie gives decent performance wilder looks like he is recovering from head injury for most of the movie and korman looks embarrassed to be part of the movie ok he really didn but he should have the films star cleavon little goes along with the siyah jokes as if they were discussing the time of day did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience admit to starting to snicker on couple of occasions actually the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise but alas it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever mel brooks would be doing the world favor if he burned every last copy of this film
days in the valley is more or less pulp fiction knock off it basically involves how bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways not going into much greater detail than that since it would take forever to explain and quite frankly not willing to spend any more time on it than the hours that ve already wasted while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction days in the valley falls way short this is quite condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello james spader and jeff daniels while the story isn much and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better days in the valley does have couple of bright spots james spader character while not much better than the rest is at least fun to watch in sick sort of way and we do get to see nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron in her first role you know movie isn that good when the highlight is brawl between two women even if they are both gorgeous will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted but marveling at that ingenuity is far cry from actually enjoying the result while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that really cared absolutely nothing about if were to put number on it only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch this is the sort of movie that only huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent and even then prepare for disappointment not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again or at least not all of it anyway
what would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in movie better question what would inspire studio to produce said movie if you have an answer let me know foolish the new movie written by and starring master is jaw droppingly horrible film one with no redeeming value socially cinematically or otherwise comedically it has some potential but only in its stand up comedy moments which can turn on comedy central for master stars as fifty dollah beat that as mobster think who is trying to start comedy club act with his little brother foolish eddie griffin but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss played by andrew dice clay for the very first time entertaining stubborn club owner and family problems the latter in foolish is perfect example of roger ebert idiot plot if everyone here wasn an idiot there would be no problem so what does foolish have to offer beside bunch of idiotic character names not hell of lot as have mentioned master cannot act or write he acts like the rapper that he is the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro as for his script well suppose he delivers what one would expect from musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience if you haven yet figured it out that is not saying much co star eddie griffin really the star of the show is quite different story the fact of the matter is that griffin whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network is an extremely talented comedian stand up and otherwise he has much in common with chris tucker rush hour money talks in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity to the extent which that can be done and while hope that does not become his trademark it works in few scenes in this movie and indeed laughed at few stand up scenes here but from feature length movie expect more foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either stupid joke in scene where tension escalates between the two brothers foolish blurts out towards his jewelry sporting sibling you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be altin rush or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car to which said bit too loudly for the occasion huh after getting slightly upset with his wife believe me when say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard earned $8 you ll get more laughs from watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you don have cable eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative although offensive yarn but everyone else should stay the hell away &#137
synopsis novelist struggling with his latest work buys weird brain with protruding eyeball encased in jar the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary while his wife disapproves meanwhile loan shark in need of shave tries to leave his profession comments why is this movie called possessed by the night it hard to speculate most of this film takes place during the day and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky pulsating bubbling brain thingie in jar in case you haven picked up on this yet possessed by the night is bottom of the barrel thriller use the term thriller loosely here which is really cheap and bad the plot which sounds like cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s actually serves one purpose to exploit nude women as often as possible writing movie review for film like this proves oddly challenging there really not much to say the acting is lousy although occasionally the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner chuckle or two from the audience most humorous is frank sivero who plays murray the novelist agent he is so horrible in this role that one can help but be amused the plot sucks nearly half the film is devoted to loser loan shark who wants out of the profession even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as whole the dialogue stinks loan shark for instance tells another how much he loves bimbos which is something the audience really doesn need to know everything about possessed by the night is second rate even the film credits as the names of the not so talented film crew scrolled by at the end joseph scales came up credited as being assistsant to foley artist someone could have used an editor to be honest the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes playboy playmate shannon tweed after all is the star here suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing he would like this movie why did give this turkey two stars and not one as bad movie it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night however recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else
okay okay maybe wasn in the mood to watch mindless action movie am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii even while admitting that it wasn as good as the others howewer the latest segal picture didn look that bad and since none of my friends would go see woody allen movie even if paid them went to see it expecting mild die hard rehash boy was wrong in the first half of the movie we are already assaulted with segal acting he is not simply wooden he is like wall gratuitous violence an incredible plot sexist and even more gratuitous nudity and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes by the end it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense of course in movies like these there must be sidekick and love interest in these one we are given two for one package in the form of playboy model in the movie which only functions as supposed comic relief by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie oh of course she appears naked from the waist up and of course segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship they did not even seem to be interested in each other have never seen so little chemistry between two people in movie often the villain saves the movie unfortunately the villains here are cartoonish stupid and unfunny unmenacing how many movies have psycho ex special forces bad guys too many was able to predict the action all throughout the movie including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him the scene where we are shown the hero superiors are stupid the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand etc simply said this is movie making by the numbers boring and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience my recommendation if you go see it bring watch you ll be looking at it for most of the movie my rent die hard read book stare at the sky do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid the real sad thing is that there are lot of movies out that would rather have seen once again dragged in by my friends which by the way liked the movie halfheartedly they probably like wrestling too

there re so many things to criticize about don know where to start recommendation turn off your brain don be like me decreasing the rating everyday because think about it too much comet is about to strike earth causing catastrophe similar to the extinction level event that wiped out the dinosaurs what follows is the story of president bid to think for the good of his people rising reporter the love story of two teenagers one of whom discovered the comet and team of astronauts on the ship `messiah to save the world firstly there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film nor is there anything outstandingly good about it but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid to be honest was more moved by the trailer than the film itself which isn saying much mimi leder follow up to `the peacemaker is equally incompetent with all the big stars wasted perhaps just annoyed that the release of `the peacemaker in the us overshadowed far superior thriller `the assignment it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives however the film simply fails on that note the effects are worn out the substandard screenplay limited the acting and the director continued her sad run in terms of good film making credentials she still making good money though leoni unfortunate character the news reporter is the foundation of the story and of the cast but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored robert duvall aging astronaut is lifeless and morgan freeman president is restricted to well righteous president which means he not interesting at all leoni character is the only appealing one and is played with reasonable conviction but rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters warning spoilers included but lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway plot holes plot holes plot holes now is threatening to exterminate more than 99% of the human race and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there where the logic leder could have at least made it plausible with 20 and then it turns out that only few percent of the world population actually perish and those less selfish ones the ones that stayed at home were the victims the film was almost mocking them telling them they had died for nothing also fail to see how two teenagers carrying baby would be the first to climb up the mountain hill even with motorbike for head start it unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle but that doesn really matter building caves was strategy mentioned in `dr strangelove which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years now that is more practical use for caves what is the point of living in caves there is no unlike `dr strangelove any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure how do plants grow if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves there no reason why they can do it in the open the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves obviously this means that the other countries were informed long time ago and you can be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media in an important mission like that of the `messiah for that matter any mission it is impossible that isn sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres needless to say tens of kilometres this is not deep impact it frivolous cheap impact but even with all that some overacting and rating it still watchable just don think about it okay
don let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare no one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work and this movie makes vain attempt at that any moves to glamorise his life which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness this movie about his life although well written puts too much make up on man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes rather than lobster and champagne oh well let fantasise onwards an assume that he was bit of flirtatious play write who falls in love with beautiful woman gwyneth paltrow and from her inspiration several plays develop romeo and juliet and the twelfth night it is easier for me to believe that he had wet dream and that how all his plays develop but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama but guess my version probably wouldn draw crowd or make dollar on screen so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul think not as for the oscars were they deserved by this movie think not in many aspects private ryan and life is beautiful were far superior movies but one should never assume that this should be criteria for winning an oscar as time and again for reasons unexplained an undeserving movie will win the accolade another sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead over more polished cate but guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised people will start feeling sorry for you
it good thing most animated sci fi movies come from japan because titan is proof that hollywood doesn have clue how to do it don know what this film is supposed to be about from what can tell it about young man named kale who one of the last survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and re generating what is left of the human race that fine premise for an action packed sci fi animated movie but there no payoff the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for legendary ship that the evil dredge aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason so in the process we get lot of spaceship fights fistfights blaster fights and more double crosses than you can shake stick at there so much pointless sci fi banter it too much to take the galaxy here is total rip off of the star wars universe the creators don bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring despite the fantastic animation and special effects it just not an interesting movie

writing screenplay for thriller is hard harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun harder than building bridge over troubled waters and incidentally whole heck of lot harder than writing movie review thrillers are all variations on theme you have smart resourceful and powerful bad guy who has goal he has to meet you have noble and brave good guy who has to protect the innocent kill the bad guy and not get killed himself in the process the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest high noon or silence of the lambs or big summer blockbusters like men in siyah the fugitive or air force one or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds event horizon kull the conqueror is anyone else getting depressed here point is it not enough to follow the formula you ve got to throw in something extra something good and new and better than the last version something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals this is hard thing to do but it is absolutely necessary in every way without that something extra whether it great plot or well written screenplay or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs the movie fails that why the jackal with all its starpower with all its budget with all its hype gets big fat bruce willis is the bad guy the jackal legendary killer for hire richard gere is the good guy former ira assassin with vendetta against the jackal the jackal is trying to kill someone gere is trying to stop him will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal ll give you three guesses and the first two don count there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal no moment when you say to yourself wonder what happens next the script for the jackal isn ripped straight from today headlines it ripped off straight from an episode of millennium throughout the movie we learn what the jackal plans are and how he intends to accomplish them no surprise the fun of movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal plan is and developing clever plan to foil the bad guy instead we get two count em two scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackal plan just as if he frank siyah or more likely just as if he been handed copy of the script and we never get more than superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight it like gere character is psychic but neither he nor the fbi or the screenwriters seem to know it and just like in millennium the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about whether or not they are important to what he trying to do or not what more in the last half of the movie the jackal supposedly super smart professional terrorist who never makes mistake comes down with major case of the stupids as for the performances bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without wisecrack which is major achievement but not enough reason to see the movie his disguises are good but not as good or as interesting as val kilmer in the saint richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in overwhelmingly disappointing movie not that his performance is bad or anything it not but it is sad that hollywood won use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent shoot to kill sneakers writing good plot and good screenplay like said is hard but it can be done it wasn done here it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones do not go see this movie you ll only encourage the producers to make more just like it instead stay home and rent day of the jackal or in the line of fire or fire safety video for crying out loud anything other than the jackal which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other better movies
all right all right we get the point despite all similarities to the best selling story speechless is not based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin in fact the script was in development well before 1992 still the comparisons are inevitable until one realizes critical difference no it not that the speechless twosome are speech writers not campaign managers it that carville and matalin story is actually interesting speechless is limp poorly structured would be romantic comedy speechless is set during new mexico senatorial campaign where kevin vallick michael keaton and julia mann geena davis meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign kevin is sit com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate speeches while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship but eventually they let down their guard and become closer but there are plent of obstacles in the way including julia stud reporter fiance christopher reeve and series of stunts which continue to prove that all fair in love and politics the standard formula for movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they re crazy about each other screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each other arms in the first fifteen minutes then developing the antagonism it noble attempt to shake things up but unfortunately it just doesn work part of the fun of watching sparring in romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do but in speechless they already know they re attracted to each other and we re left with waiting for the campaign to end so they ll admit that they love each other already there is such herky jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king sharp dialogue can prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton and with those performances most of their scenes together the problems begin with their initial courtship which does virtually nothing to establish julia character and merely establishes that kevin is wise ass davis is radiantly beautiful and keaton is generally entertaining but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit in couple of scenes like quiet moment sitting at fountain they actually achieve some measure of connection for the most part however they re just actors spouting lines you keep waiting for little spark and it never happens perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless politics the setting seems perfect for high energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix but that never the tone that underwood is going for he wants warm fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman flute and wind musical score and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background it might as well have been story about rival grocers and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king previous screenplay the dana carvey flop clean slate so had some hopes for speechless but while there is wit in the words this is script which was probably much better on paper on screen it still paper thin
teenagers have lot of power in hollywood every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights wallets in hand the formula is very simple you make film with big name young actor or actress with sex appeal you add high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds and then very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes the typical teenage attention span the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any film set in an environment they can relate to and most importantly they don92t care to judge films=92 quality so any piece of trash will due that is just what never been kissed the latest film from director raja gosnell is trash josie geller drew barrymore is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times she has her own personal assistant unlimited supplies and her own office but she is very much dismayed with her position in life there is nothing she wants more than to be reporter and go out into the field where she can play more active role in the chicago media so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere she jumps at it with elation constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita molly shannon and her amicable superior gus john reilly the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment as they both deem her to be an office worker and not reporter however since this film is aimed at teenage audience with little patience for character conflict this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes and josie is headed for the field obviously the field assignment involves high school specifically she is to become an undercover reporter at high school by enrolling in the senior class and becoming one of them don92t think that need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring so won92t the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of dork she truly was and she appears to be heading down that road again fortunately for this lame production other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting they include the predictable love stories between both student jeremy jordan and teacher michael vartan to show that josie is really two people in one body also her younger brother and opposite rob david arquette comes into her new found life and even causes rare scene that is mildly provocative the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing typical for teenage films it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor one scene in particular features certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy but those still don92t recover for the total lack of quality in this movie following this trend of high school movie rules comes the general acting it is even worse than the trend of overplaying scenario from film to film in this case drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch she is required to play her character on two levels having some very siyah and beyaz transitions and although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on ferris wheel and is expected to him on an adult level since he is one her teacher but she never seems to get out of the gray area and in doing so she makes mockery out of his otherwise good performance following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon saturday night live she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic it is these qualities that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film david arquette scream takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic and not have his brilliant acting ruined and as central character he gets to take on his own mini plot which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed in dazzling cherry on the sundae type piece of work he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit risky business never been kissed is mediocre film at best the predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood that it is sickening to watch time and again and this film is no exception the acting is just as bad but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light unfortunately the bottom line is that the movie will be success because teenagers will pay to see any trash
walken stars as mobster who is kidnapped and held for ransom by four bratty rich kids it seems that woman has also been kidnapped she is the sister of one of them henry thomas and the girlfriend of another flannery and the asking price is $2 million which said snots are unable to cough up alone they even cut off walken finger to show they mean business because they are desperate to save the woman life suicide kings is terrible film walken aside there isn single appealing cast member fallon creates characters that are functional types without any resonance in an amusingly unironic scene walken plays poker with the foursome and describes each of their personalities to tee it as if he was reading the summary sheet for casting director the plot is another issue entirely fallon is someone whom betting has seen reservoir dogs and the usual suspects too many times for not only does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence they never return do we really need the scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father with toaster which is entirely unrelated to both the story and leary character or the numerous anecdotal sequences but the central plot itself is serpentine mess filled with crosses and double crosses and triple crosses by the fourth big revelation twist had completely tuned out wondering what on earth attracted these actors to the material recently peer fellow young filmmaker informed me that he had an idea for movie about four guys the mob and the fbi it occurred to me then what wrong with indies like suicide kings suspect fallon has never met mobster is not rich man doesn deliver endless clever monologues to his friends about his favourite types of boots in short these guys are just riffing on other movies and in doing that making the same film over and over and over again tarantino found his niche and now hundreds of genxers with movie cameras are trying to find tarantino niche instead of carving their own reviewed at the toronto international film festival
well there goes another one sadly this like other movies this year wasn good this one being almost as bad as the omega code but not quite from the opening credits had good feeling this would be bad and well guess was right with bad excuses for acting horrible screenplay and straight out bad direction the bachelor is terribly unfunny movie that doesn work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give good performance the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best the movie is troubled from the start because chris donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date here is the stupid plot chris donnell plays jimmie shelton man who has just broken up with his girlfriend he meets anne rene zellwegar they instantly hit it off and are together for three years jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship little bit up he really doesn realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her what he wants never did catch so he proposes in really bad way and she shoots him down and is very mad he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars as long as he marries before the next day at 05 pm now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her or get married to someone else to get the money itself leading to an un funny and predictable ending that leaves bad taste in our mouths ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest cliched silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs even the supporting roles of artie lange hal holbrook and ed anser aren even good the plot was good idea but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by five year old the choppy dialogue and bad directing don help things any even though chris donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies he does not give even remotely good or funny performance here and wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him rene zelweggar is different story and gave charming sweet and likable performance as usual and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being total huge washout her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen brooke shields showed up in funny little performance as big headed mogul who after while became routine and old one really can help but think that we have seen this stuff before it not like this is an original idea and in the end everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness the bachelor works on no good levels and in fact doesn work at all ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career chris donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying great deal he seems held back and really doesn get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un nerving why the filmmakers would want to waste such cast in such bad movie with such bad acting and dialogue is question only they will know maybe they thought it would become hit or critical success and sometimes don agree with other critics on movies even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts its based on the 1925 silent film seven chances which am sure is very better than this mess even though some may think of this as good date movie most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back besides being terrible movie the bachelor is well terrible movie it has nothing worth recommending therefore really can recommend this movie did not have good time and laughed only three times the running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes parts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time being one of the worst movies of the year we can be sure that hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies and if they do they give up on filmmakers
my inner flag was at half mast last year when nick at nite pulled dragnet reruns off the air sure seen them all at least once but could always count on at least few inadvertent laughs from ultra serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv even though dragnet is out of circulation at the moment we webb anti fans still have the 50 propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous mavi boy episode of dragnet for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb rapid fire speeches and straight faced seriousness think of the as what would happen if sgt joe friday ever enlisted because he plays exactly the same character here no nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long winded melodramatic speeches on any topic in this election year more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb office door and enters he gives each one different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up the produced and directed by jack webb card pretty much goes without saying this is his movie all the way and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason was wondering if there would even be plot certainly would have been entertained by an hour and half of trademark webb rants but the gives us more much more webb mission is to make man out of private owens the local screw up the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or the captain will personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself whether the lace panties part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered this of course gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens life living hell for those of you who haven been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching here reprint of typical monologue of his can duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper but the words should at least partially convey what talking about now you listen to me youngster someday you ll wake up fighting on beach and you ll pray to god somebody doesn get killed because of your foolishness ve got headline for you every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours you re gonna turn around and ll be standing right there couldn write down all the reprintable dialogue from the nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame but tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines like one from the scene where webb unwinds from hard day work by going to the local bar where he orders tomato juice he meets woman who coincidentally also orders tomato juice but walks away from typically stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch rival another marine webb marches over to the table gets up in her face and says just what kind of dame do you think you are bogart he ain the other gets one of the few memorable non webb lines when he confesses to the girl he damn good guess just little jealous join the club we re all jealous of jack webb way with women which is showcased even more amusingly in later scene as webb finds his way to the woman place of employment lingerie store and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display you expect me to talk to you in _here_ he exclaims no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras the woman goes off to help customer leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen little girl spots him in the store and demands what are you doing in here you re man aren you he doesn reply but you know he thinking in his head what an odd species of human so small must be one of those children everyone been talking about this poor girl scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb would later swear off the male gender entirely just one of the many lesbian conversions he responsible for the movie doesn focus too closely on webb romance it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for flea owens killed during one of their drills after two privates hatch scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea webb asks owens was that flea you killed male or female owens replies male sir webb yells to the platoon this ain the one that such scene along with the rest of the movie was intended to be taken seriously defies comment but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the but for iwo jima guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie with the exception of owens were played by actual marines someone wanting to parody this movie couldn do more comical job than webb did it makes it all the more ironic like raeeyain on your wedding day that the man had no sense of humor himself there scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter webb bursts in the room and shouts what did tell you about laughing to which the private replies sir only nine year old girls laugh sir and let me tell you was as happy as nine year old girl while watching this movie

there only one presidential election every four years but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as _the_ thriller of the year in 1997 we ve had absolute power air force one shadow conspiracy and murder at 1600 this one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford trying to bring us complex plot of cover up and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys here what happens this time it night at the beyaz house secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with cute butt the next day she dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in how do we know he hotshot we ve seen the traditional action flick opener the clever hostage negotiation scene it not so clever this time consisting of snipes disarming suicidal ex government employee holding gun to his head in the middle of the street snipes is off to the beyaz house where he finds the secret service head the shiny bald head of daniel benzali won cooperate with him at all in fact if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda snipes wouldn have been allowed in the beyaz house at all alda helps snipes out further assigning sexy secret service agent diane lane to act as his liaison very dangerous liaison well not really just wanted to say that almost immediately suspect is found an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos snipes doesn buy it and launches into an independent investigation of his own one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the president son snipes partner an always wisecracking dennis miller calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane who at first doesn believe snipes eventually and predictably comes around and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information for the first hour or so murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting sure we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that but the whole murder in the beyaz house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon snipes and lane don make for bad action team but with nothing to work with they re just cogs in the bad movie machine dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie they waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than they did in bordello of blood and that saying lot when you get to the last half hour the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into wet sewer busting out the old break into the building underground climax and when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why you ll wish you never sat through this movie at all the 1600 in the movie title doesn represent an address it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide serving the world for nearly 25th of century
ah and 1999 was going along so well too she all that has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie ve seen so far this year and quite frankly doubt ll see anything equally bad at least hope don see anything equally bad she all that tells the story of the most popular guy in school played by freddie prinze jr who accepts bet to transform the geekiest girl in school rachel leigh cook into the most popular that right there is problem #1 how many times have we seen this storyline as cook comments near the end of the film it kind of like pretty woman except without the prostitution of course had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material the well worn storyline would have been device to propell the movie forward as it is though she all that relies completely on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead there not one original or interesting character in the film either and if that wasn bad enough there not one good performance featured the star of the movie rachel leigh cook is simply horrible usually don like to get so personal but in this case think it needs to be said cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable time as was was never convinced that she was nerd and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary the movie seems to be saying it better to be popular than to be who you are as for freddie prinze jr an actor ordinarily enjoy he too is quite bad here he coasts through the film on so called charm and never establishes real character kieren culkin is here too as the brother of cook and for some indiscernable reason he got hearing aids no explanation is given and they re never brought up were we supposed to feel sorry for him just because he wore hearing aids don think so that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things ve seen in movie in long time she all that sucks that what it boils down to it not entertaining and it not even good time passer the hour and half running time goes by slower than minute hair removal system informercial and what worse it sends out bad message to teens it appears to be telling them hey it doesn matter if you re happy the way you are that unimportant if you want to truly be happy dress in the latest fashions and act like bubble headed moron ugh
michael robbins hardball is quite the cinematic achievement in about two hours we get glancing examination of ghetto life funeral with heartfelt eulogy speeches about never giving up cache of cute kids including fat one with asthma hard luck gambler who finds salvation in good woman and climactic big game where the underdogs prove to have bigger bite than anyone ever imagined all that needed is guy getting hit in the nuts and food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich can wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd obviously hardball is strikeout of movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball it stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam out of solutions he begs his successful corporate friend the always welcome mike mcglone to lend him $5 000 instead mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach youth baseball team from the projects for nice weekly stipend reeves who wants to keep his fingers accepts the offer but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely the drowsy voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in life of absentee parents and merciless gangs and maybe just maybe they ll play in the big championship game one of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins summer catch adapted from daniel coyle non fiction book is that there aren any the movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like zombie that wouldn be so bad if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them most of the kids time is spent yelling at each other talking in slang and acting surprised there little that naturally amusing about them as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling the worst of the lot is tough talking younger player dewayne warren whose sole purpose as the movie unfolds is being an emotional pawn tactic so utterly despicable can find the right words to express myself the adults also don fare well reeves is impressively uninspiring as the down on his luck loser the character is poorly written but reeves gives another charisma free performance every time he speaks he sounds like he just got up from long nap and is gradually waking up kids are supposed to rally around this guy diane lane who co stars as reeves obligatory love interest remains glowing screen presence see my dog skip for better proof it too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like these kids trust you and they don trust anyone then there sweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters you ve seen before and hope never to see again wanted hardball to be good robbins varsity blues was funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved haven seen robbins goofy ready to rumble in its entirety but am intrigued that macho man randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions robbins obviously needs to go back to his forte making sports movies for guys and not cutesy cuddly pap such as hardball which also manages to annoy and insult the audience here hoping that happens in the immediate future
you know something christmas is not about presents it about over hyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tie ins at least that would seem to be the message of the grinch which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season you know the plot there this evil furry green guy called the grinch jim carrey who lives on mountain overlooking whoville down below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas the movie is of course live action version of the beloved children book which was previously adapted into 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones it rare that big budget hollywood release is shamed by thirty year old half hour cartoon but that the case when jones version is compared to ron howard the tv grinch hit all the right notes boris karloff soft deep narration thurl ravenscroft singing mr grinch max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head and the grinch wide toothless grin by contrast the movie hits one sour note after another first there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into 105 minute movie young wide eyed cindy lou who taylor momsen is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents bill irwin and molly shannon during the holiday season she begins to sympathize with the grinch who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class martha may whovier played as an adult by christine baranski are we expected to like the grinch hate the whos and want him to steal christmas the grinch isn even the villain here that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville jeffrey tambor who was the grinch rival for martha affection not only are the characters needlessly complex but the once simple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought the casting choices aren any better than the screenwriting decisions jim carrey seems woefully miscast while his face is so supple that the rubber make up seems superfluous carrey brings nothing else to the role his accent keeps changing assume he was shooting for karloff but he ends up sounding like weird slurry of richard nixon sean connery and cartman from south park not knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinch home carrey falls back on his stand up comedy and clowns around ace ventura style needless to say his wise cracking antics don quite fit the character of the grinch who is an embittered loner filled with hate little taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and cute smile she would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story finding santa in her living room stealing the tree however the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch and momsen is not up to the challenge bottom line when you re stealing christmas movies leave this one behind
in the mid 1980s following the splendid debut in hugh hudson greystoke and relative success of first highlander film it looked like christopher lambert acting career might go somewhere but it wasn meant to be which became obvious following highlander ii in this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality very often such films were science fiction which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert whether it was because of real lack of talent terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn important the end result was almost always horrible the same can be said for fortress 1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond the movie is set in 2018 for some undisclosed reason usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child jake christopher lambert and karen brennick lori laughlin broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border sentenced to 31 years in prison they are both thrown into fortress privately owned correctional facility equiped with state of the art futuristic technology and run by computer called zed although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates lives and make any escape impossible prison authorities often use violence jake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape such escape should become necessity because the warden poe kurtwood smith begins showing unhealthy interest in karen after rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity the reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich and situations that are painfully predictable by the time brennick begins his escape from fortress those situations not only begin to look predictable but utterly implausible too of course film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultra expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society the initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters played by not too interested or talented actors lori laughlin although physically attractive shows the acting ability of sequoia kurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired capable of solid yet forgettable performance lambert performance is also good but even the bigger talent couldn help this film destined to end in oblivion
susan granger review of the musketeer universal pictures hollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this $50 million adaptation of alexandre dumas novel that strong on action but weak on drama fusing hong kong martial arts with 17th century swordplay the story chronicles the adventures of the dashing artagnan justin chambers as he leaves his village of gascogne headed for paris to join king louis xiii elite guard the royal musketeers and to search for the man who killed his parents 14 years earlier this puts him in conflict with the formidable febre tim roth vicious henchman for conniving cardinal richelieu stephen rea the traditional musketeer trio aramis nick moran athos jan gregor kremp and porthos steve speirs don offer much help so he turns to the feisty francesca mena suvari chambermaid to the queen of france catherine deneuve scripter gene quintano and director cinematographer peter hyams are primarily interested in the derring do as evidenced by choreographer xin xin xiong elaborate but not original stunts including fast paced stagecoach chase tavern brawl on rolling barrels high wire acrobatics with the combatants dangling from ropes and ladder fight sequence filmed in southern france the scenery sets and costumes are spectacular but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy restless mtv ish cuts as the swashbuckling artagnan bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing totally lacking on screen charisma not to mention acting skill mena suvari so impressive in american beauty seems like contemporary interloper in the royal court on the granger movie gauge of to 10 the musketeer is cinematic but shallow all for one and one for all not this time round
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned at the end of the day those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for gala premiere this highly anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening where it would have gone head to head against the rival studios heavy hitters its eventual demotion to less potent mid august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio lack of confidence with the picture and with good reason this is joyless exercise of film held together by barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement thrills or wit remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving the avengers is catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year case study in style over substance joel schumacher much loathed batman robin indeed both films even feature appalling ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes uma thurman who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit clad karate chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster imbuing her poison ivy with dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage unfortunately the same can be said here where she and cohort ralph fiennes our new john steed taking over for patrick macnee demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they re on board sinking ship at this rate usually splendid actor mr fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days the duo look the part and admittedly the avengers is more than most heavily dependent upon style but they re no fun to watch and found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture caper esque plot when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs peel no not kate beckinsale although the notion now intrigues me but gwyneth paltrow who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle spot on english accent if nothing else it at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt the story such as it is involves the ever bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter sean connery an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate controlling contraption they also sip lot of tea overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists superiors it sounds far better than it plays and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post production tinkering it clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds the avengers was never about gripping drama and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac it all decidedly uncompelling mr connery who onscreen barely long enough to register an impression approaches the role like man fulfilling contractual obligation simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest at least it all looks good this is genuinely handsome production with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt in particular the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain there are handful of striking visual moments in the film including an attack by swarm of giant robotic bees and nice shot of steed and peel finding way to walk on water but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates by the time the film climax had arrived my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain but with the quickest escape route from the theatre not coincidentally the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie remarkable trailer savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year it everything that the avengers is not saucy clever engaging and entertaining crushing disappointment the film is one of the worst outings of the year too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad too polished to overlook its deficiencies there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers but sure hope not
stallone attempts to act in this cop drama the film is set in neighbourhood pratically built by kietal who nephew played by michael rappaport is involved in car crash and killing of two siyah youths keital dosen really want to get involved in anything gets rid of rappaport and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on this film should be brilliant it sounds like great plot the actors are first grade and the supporting cast is good aswell and stallone is attempting to deliver good performance however it can hold up although the acting is fantastic even stallone isn bad the directing and story is dull and long winded some scenes go on for too long with nothing really happening in them in fact the only scenes that do work are action scenes which suspect stallone was trying to avoid in this film serious means dull the dialogue is warbling and basically just repeats the same points over and over no matter who is delivering them the plot which has potential is wasted again just being cliched after while in fact the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro both delivering their usual good performances however stallone although not given much to say gives good performance however it not all that bad as said above the action scenes are well done theres also very good ending which uses the cinemas sound system well in fact the last 10 minutes of this hour film are one of the best endings of 1997 if only the rest of the film was as good as the ending cop land then turns out not to be power house film but rather dull and not every exciting film hugely disappointing and can really recommend it
the first species was moderately successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects few well paced action sequences and frequent views of model turned actress natasha henstridge sans clothing however it was definitely not movie that cried out for sequel and considering the quality of species it obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead the only thing that distinguishes species is how awful it is if you throw away the plot which is characterized by blatant disregard for intelligence logic coherence and consistency species actually has few things to recommend it to select audience of course that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys who at least in theory shouldn be able to get into an rated film and connoisseurs of bad movies there enough blood gore simulated sex and bare flesh in species to prevent it from ever becoming boring this is grade exploitation flick that ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment somewhere someplace recall hearing species described as erotic would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie because he or she has peculiar notion of eroticism sure there lot of sex and nudity but it almost always accompanied by the ripping open of woman abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free splattering blood and gore in all directions anyone turned on by that is not someone would care to be sitting next to in theater suppose the main attraction in species is natasha henstridge and to get the obvious question out of the way yes she does remove her top but only once and only briefly although the character she played in the original species is dead government scientists still have the dna and out of what can only be described as suicidal impulse they decide to create another clone this creature dubbed eve by its creator dr laura baker played by marg helgenberger reprising her role is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile meanwhile man has finally set foot on mars team of three led by patrick ross justin lazard has traveled to the kirmizi planet but when they return to earth they bring something with them ross has become half human half alien hybrid and he soon mating like crazy collecting the blood soaked children that are the result of each sex session his intention is obviously world domination standing in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film preston lennox michael madsen and one of patrick fellow astronauts dennis gamble mykelti williamson but when patrick learns about eve female of his kind there no damping his ardor not sure what the budget for species was but significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors as opposed to being diverted into the special effects michael madsen and marg helgenberger both back for second round are clearly on hand to do as little as they can grab the money and run ditto for james cromwell who plays patrick father underused is too kind word to describe his involvement invisible would be more like it george dzundza gets to do little scenery chewing as an angry but inept general meanwhile justin lazard performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge limited abilities look good by comparison the only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson who is cast in the part of the wisecracking siyah sidekick complete with cheesy special effects bare breasts around every narrative corner and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter species has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics director peter medak journeyman film maker with significant list of mediocre movies on his resume has added another forgettable title but at least he appears to have had fun doing it which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even scintilla of seriousness do recommend the movie absolutely not but will admit that species is dopey enough that it didn try my patience to the degree that some pseudo intellectual bad movies do here hoping there no species
number of critics have decided that it open season on freddie prize jr slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound alike disposable teen fluff like head over heels boys and girls down to you and she all that while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend his talent is not first saw him in the independent dark comedy the house of yes where he gave subtle impressive performance as the younger brother in one of america freakiest families prinze has the acting chops he just needs to take few supporting roles in some grown up movies to show the non believers that he has what it takes summer catch certainly won help his case inoffensive but utterly generic the baseball related romantic comedy does little more than kill time the story deals with the love affair between tenley jessica biel wealthy cape cod girl and ryan prinze local boy from working class family who dreams of becoming big time baseball star ryan preoccupation with his new honey bunny drives her elitist father bruce davison crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with cape cod summer league team it wonder the kid has any time to pitch as his time is occupied with making out with tenley fighting with her dad bonding with his own dad fred ward who deserves better than this fighting with his brother jason gedrick and carousing at neighborhood bar with his teammates the filmmakers desperately want to make quirky character heavy baseball movie like bull durham but haven got clue how to get there and so they glide from one clich to the next for 108 minutes the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in minor role as center fielder from texas in an early barroom scene blucas best known as demon fighting riley finn from buffy the vampire slayer hears young woman compliment guy on his ass then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states he does have nice ass bubble butt when lillard gives him an are you insane look blucas calmly says it nothing sexual then goes on to evaluate the hind ends of some other players including lillard speaking of asses prinze does not bare his in the movie the actor has no nudity clause in his contract so two stunt butts were employed for couple of semi nude shots blucas whose character secretly dates large woman throughout the story gets another unique moment late in the film sick of hearing teammates make fat chick jokes he climbs on top of table and loudly declares his love of amply sized ladies while his speech still ends up objectifying women it remains nice change of pace in numbingly ordinary movie trivial tidbit summer catch marks scooby doo summit marc blucas appears in jay and silent bob strike back as fred from the scooby doo gang while freddie prinze jr plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon
everybody in this film thinking of alicia no this is not documentary on those of us after we first saw the cryin video this is one of those erotic thrillers but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed first off there zero sex almost no nudity and it not as well plotted as one of those tweed flicks well anyway the plot alicia plays well the babysitter who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents walsh and lee garlington go out to party the film trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers shows every characters thoughts except alicia the thing is alicia in most of them in most cases and the thoughts aren too kosher first off there her boyfriend jeremy london who gave one of the all time lousy performances in mallrats and is only notch better here who dorky kid who hangs out with kind of bully played by nicky katt from suburbia who shows he got that quiet creepiness down pat once again they decide they want to crash her babysitting job looking for the typical babysitting hanky panky somethine like that the film intercuts between the subplots alicia babysitting nicky and jeremy the party and each characters thoughts we get to see jeremy and nicky dreams of doing little threeway with alicia thinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub she has it all covered up the little tease and worst of all lee garlington dreaming of that hunk george segal it even shows them in bed together yea so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed though guess used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in flirting with disaster the ending is some kind of big tragedy thing but come on like we care about any of the characters the only interesting one is alicia mainly because she alicia and we mostly see her in the fantasies so guess she some kind of mystery or something but she is never explored further so basically this film is just series of mastabatory images sometimes featuring non nude alicia once again sadly sometimes featuring scantily clad george segal once again sadly watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night and let me tell you it is the only way to watch this film mean there reason they put these kinds of films on late at night they re just as good as sleeping pills and this one is one big fat waste of time even for an alicia film
star wars episode the phantom menace 1999 director george lucas cast liam neeson ewan mcgregor natalie portman jake lloyd ian mcdiarmid samuel jackson oliver ford davies terence stamp pernilla august frank oz ahmed best kenny baker anthony daniels screenplay george lucas producers rick mccallum runtime 131 min us distribution 20th century fox rated pg mild violence thematic elements copyright 1999 nathaniel atcheson fellow critic once stated his belief that reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review ve attempted to obey this rule in recent months but to do so would be impossible in this case the fact is nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people for me they calibrated my creativity as child they are masterful original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time and they still hold up pretty darn well am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release but that doesn make me any less dedicated to it on the contrary the star wars trilogy and the empire strikes back in particular are three items on very short list of why love movies when heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine film series got exited when first saw screenshots from the film well over year ago embarked on year long drool of anticipation and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving was ready to see the film but then there was the hype the insane marketing campaign and lucasfilm secretive snobbery over the picture in the last weeks before the picture opened while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater was tired of hearing about it was tired of seeing cardboard cut outs of the characters whenever went to kfc or taco bell just wanted to see the movie reader do not misunderstand did not have an anti hype reaction the hype was unavoidable understand and accept the hype it just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released five minutes into the phantom menace knew there was problem who are these jedi knights asked why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine gun rapidity why aren these characters being developed before their adventures why is there special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film these were just some of my questions early on later asked where the magic of the first three films and why am looking at my watch every fifteen minutes by the end of the film was tired maddened and depressed george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into pointless mindless summer blockbuster the phantom menace is no star wars film take away the title and the jedi talk and the force and you re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time it an embarrassment looked desperately for scene in which character is explored or new theme is examined or special effects shot isn used there are few of each but they re all token attempts the fact is george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for movie and pretty good showcase for digital effects this is not what wanted to see didn want to leave the phantom menace with headache and bitter taste in my mouth but did the story centers mostly around qui gon jinn liam neeson looking lost and confused and his apprentice obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor who scarcely has line in the film and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo naboo is the victim of bureaucratic war with the trade federation their contact on naboo is queen amidala natalie portman the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people after picking up jar jar binks completely cgi character voiced by ahmed best they head to tatooine where they meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his mother pernilla august qui gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters there isn anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form the way lucas has handled it however it unsatisfactory first of all we don learn one single thing about qui gon jinn not one thing what was his life like before this film well imagine he didn have one that why he feels like plot device this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role and why he recently retired from film don blame him honestly obi wan character was really looking forward to learning more about is even less interesting mcgregor has just few lines so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in great performance is urged to look elsewhere since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace lucas has served us big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed out character in the film and lloyd does thoughtful job with the role was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting and when anakin says goodbye to his mother found it moving also fairly good is portman and she manages to give little depth to character where no depth has been written jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters ve ever had to endure but he more interesting than most of the humans as soon as the relatively brief segment on tatooine is over it back to the mind numbing special effects and depthless action scenes ve seen many movies that qualify as special effects extravaganzas but the phantom menace is the first one ve seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie the reason is obvious george lucas has no restraint can say that didn find the effects original because did the final battle between darth maul obi wan and qui gon is visually exceptional as is most of the film but also found the effects deadening and tiresome my breaking point was near the end of the picture as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters in the background we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through digital sky and wanted that to go away can we have one stinking scene that isn bursting at the seems with special effects shot got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that really just wanted to go outside and look at physical landscape for few hours and then there the question of magic what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi have feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel john williams familiar score is no help nor is lucas direction think it comes right down to characters there are none here longed for the magnetic presence of han luke and leia but got no such thing and what about the ridiculous expectations mine weren that high simply wanted film that showed me the roots of the films that grew up loving story that had few characters and few great special effects instead got two hours and fifteen minutes of lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show don hate the phantom menace as much as resent it like to forget that it exists and yet can it here to stay can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them because if they don then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series
the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is fascinating topic finding an all star cast for such film is stroke of genius combining all that with three time oscar winning director robert benton of kramer vs kramer and creating decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment in yet another noir mystery set in hollywood how many of these have we seen during the past few years the atmosphere is moody the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere over 70 harry ross paul newman is washed up cop turned private eye turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life he screwed up things pretty well had wife and daughter now drunk and is at crossroads couple of years ago he traveled to mexico to bring back mel reese witherspoon the under age daughter of jack gene hackman and catherine susan sarandon ames and now lives with them the ames are former movie stars past their prime and the three have become fast friends one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up to fill his time he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine jack is in even worse shape than harry he dying of cancer with only year to live things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off sealed manila envelope for him instead of the routine errand that ross expects he walks into barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex cop who is himself full of bloody holes this unsettling event gives the former detective project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine first husband 20 years before through series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder blackmail guns mel mexico traveling partner and his parole officer ross former cop buddies ex lover and would be sidekick the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to it film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario by the time they show you it doesn matter the storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross relationship with rubin giancarlo esposito partner wannabe these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief however they are neither rubin and ross have some past relationship but either it not explained or didn care enough at that point to remember running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform it also not funny doesn connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course on the positive side it often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen the three leads all have well deserved academy awards and turn in accomplished if not extraordinary jobs newman is grand actor but doesn seem quite suited to the dark film style he is bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out hackman also low key is believable but lacks sparkle sarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is one dimensional the actors do what they can with lame dialog but they can pull the film out of the hole it dug for itself james garner who plays ross old buddy ex cop raymond hope is always treat but even he half heartedly struggles through lines like glad they didn shoot your pecker off the best part of the film is the look at old friends how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make the genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen the film doesn run very long before the audience realizes that it hopeless the only reason for watching is the actors it reminds me of disaster movies such as towering inferno where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the film problems in better world there would have been second rate actors in this second rate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better of course we don live in that better world but you could make yours little nicer by choosing different movie
martial arts master steven seagal not to mention director has built career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights talks in hushed tone and squints at any sign of danger he also the most consistent individual in hollywood today since all his movies suck they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art that is martial art sure the guy good and he seems like nice guy on talk shows although tad haughty but these movies he makes are all the same guy who is basically indestructable is maybe wounded supposedly mortally then comes back with vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses although kinda liked under siege of course this one as change has message that is drilled into our mind of course after he blows up lot of stuff and kills bunch of people so why do watch his crap usually don will never and you can hold me to this will never pay to see this man movies unless and only unless he in supporting role executive decision and definitely pay if he dies executive decision but this one has special place in my heart this doesn mean it good or that even liked it this was the last movie watched with my deceased uncle and we had one hell of time ripping it apart la mystery science theatre 3000 and this was couple years before had heard of mystery science theatre 3000 in this one seagal plays worker for mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased up typical shallow villain this time played by an oscar winner to give the movie some more clout michael caine it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land around the 20 30 minute point seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs what with his new fire down below another message film and caine has him bumped off or does he seagal is rescued by some inuits and falls in love with one of them played by joan chen who can act hypothetically but for some reason not here one of caine cliched henchmen played here with lot of overacting by john mcginley shoots the cheif of the inuit clan and chen and seagal go on voyage to take down the oil factory literally of course at one point seagal gives wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn have any options but blow stuff up he even goes as far as to say don want to kill someone and in the same breath he asks some guy where the arsenal is have no problem with violence huge john woo fan but he paints his films with suspense skill style depth characterization and just plain cool violence in the films of seagal the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly and him either wounding or killing them at some points they use the cliche of the talking villain where the villain has the advantage can shoot seagal but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan or saying corny line to which seagal says something hokey back and has had enough time to devise of way to do away with them and does this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn take itself seriously at all like in the case of this summer con air but seagal is serious about his skill and of course his message wouldn mind if this was message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence but seagal has no idea how to present film where the message is subtle not pounded into the viewer mind the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish thus we can take him and his motives seriously and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment he also goes ahead and blows up square mile of rig and kills some workers who were just doing his job then at the end he spends good 10 minutes giving speech just in case you didn get the message from the trailers what seagal doesn realize is that no one takes his films seriously although maybe couple do and any message he has is no only redundant but doesn comfortably fit in his film which is filled to the brim with hokey violence crap suspense stupid melodrama and characters who have about as much emotional depth as petri dish as far as seagal and his acting he rather boring he squints he kills period nothing else oh yeah there corny one liners gonna reach out and touch someone of course he the star and we re supposed to root for him and all so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and bunch of jerks michael caine who great actor is just supposed to yell and look cold he does it well guess but this is no alfie of coure no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him his big henchman john mcginley is kinda boring as well but is not horrible and we even get small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid lee ermey from full metal jacket as hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is just for the movie trailers and for seagal ego and also look for billy bob thornton as one of ermey assasins anyway to conclude this all to judge one of seagal movies is to judge all of them except for under siege and executive decision though the latter is not really seagal movie they all have this same formula they all have the same action same villain same plot but this one has that message which makes it more excrucitating to watch mean if you do rent it and don reccomend you do make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes but have to put it to seagal for creating film so bad that the last film viewed with my uncle was pleasurable one my extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock
arye cross and courteney cox star as pair of bostonians who meet in bar go to the movies fall in love move in together etc review ====== well if you haven seen when harry met sally or he said she said or if you don watch love war on television you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages however if you ve seen any of these than you have seen most of this film this of course doesn mean its bad some of it is amusing but overall just had to ask what the point arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love kevin pollack is the stereotypical female fearing best friend who make lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes most if which weren very funny couteney cox is the stereotypical career minded woman who falls in love julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical this film uses lot of formula the plot is basically known from the opening credits so what is good about the movie well as said there are few amusing moments surprisingly julie brown who usually find just plain goofy was the best thing in the film also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual gee this is really short not much to say about the film really it is just kind of there watching it on video might not be complete waste of time but wouldn recommend hiring baby sitter or spending lot of money to see it at the theatre
_soldier_ is hands down one of the worst movies person could ever have to sit through that doesn have jean claude van damme in it could liken it to the sci fi cheese that was the hollywood product of choice back in the early 80s but that would be too much of compliment if there is movie theater in hell this film is playing there 24 hours day the story such that there is revolves around todd kurt russell an automaton of man who has been raised from birth to be merciless soldier in not too distant ultra conservative future is there any other kind after years of desensitization at military academy full of other boys just like him todd becomes ground fighter in series of wars all over the galaxy who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesn matter because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash yes folks there more we see todd as buff scarred adult now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break sweat there new wrinkle though todd and his brethren are declared obsolete and new batch of soldiers takes their place after losing sanctioned battle with _dragon_ jason scott lee the seemingly dead todd is dumped by flying ice cube tray well that what is looked like on remote garbage planet if you predict that todd meets bunch of outcast settlers on this planet and that they band together to fight bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them you re way ahead of the game the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half expect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute it surprising that _soldier_ is the brain child of _blade runner_ co writer david webb peoples unlike that mind twisting classic this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three double spaced pages add into the mix the _mortal kombat_ paul anderson inept direction and it easy to see how _soldier_ turned out so bad and the special effects remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars gary busey is in this movie nuff said _soldier_ is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all now if you ll excuse me have to go weep for the future
it sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it such is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film _the last samurai_ though the blurb alludes to jungle filled with political intrigue uneasy alliances and murderous enemies at every turn the story of the movie is actually quite simple and prosaic middle aged japanese businessman named endo played by john fujioka and his assistant both of whom have samurai aspirations travel to africa in search of his ancestor who went to bring buddhism to africa he hires the services of down at the heels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo the redoubtable lance henriksen and his girlfriend arabella holzbog and travels to the camp of an arms merchant cum safari host cum islamic missionary john saxon and his wife lisa eilbacher they are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witch doctor aspirations to conceal pre arranged arms deal which subsequently falls through congo escapes finds endo ancestor sword and comes back guns blazing to free the rest of them and endo kills the revolutionary with the sword the end _the last samurai_ is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoyable it is merely _there_ the murky plot is filled with subtexts that are never elaborated subplots that are never explained and many scenes that make very little sense at all the film is shot through with all the tired old inscrutable japanese samurai and zen stereotypes that are to be expected from an american movie it is quite slow paced with only bit of action near the end and the final duel between endo and the terrorist is quite anticlimactic most of the acting is fair with the possible exception of congo girlfriend lance henriksen is his usual scene chewing self and is one of few possible reasons anyone might conceivably have for seeing this movie the only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery paid $3 for this film from the discount rack at best buy and halfway suspect overpaid for it if you are in the mood for samurai read clavell novel or watch kurusawa movie skip _the last samurai_ unless you are die hard henriksen fan
birthdays often cause individuals to access their lives are we doing what we want to be doing what happened to our dreams with the new millennium our collective big birthday just around the corner some people are sensing certain dissatisfaction with their existence the old standbys of traditional religion and science aren doing it for many anymore and they re looking for something else we ll be seeing more and more films with metaphysical theme over the next few years ricky hayman jeff goldblum is having career crisis the programming director for the good buy home shopping network he going to be fired unless sales increase dramatically new producer kate newell kelly preston is supposed to whip things into shape when the two are fixing flat they almost run down new age pilgrim murphy wanders onto the television set and connects with the viewers by telling them that they don really want all that commercial crap in some unexplained manner this causes sales to sour ricky is saved the movie tries to be too much at once and fails at it all it not an over the top comedy or heart warming message of humanity it _is_ mish mosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog am willing to put up with preaching from film but the messages here are old hat you should take time to smell the roses selling your soul for cash is bad idea golly glad saw the movie never would have thought of these the opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed when takes chainsaw to the set there an obvious chance for murphy to be hilarious it doesn happen the bits are so subdued and overly long that there only hint of laughter from the audience murphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better there are hints of promise in this one the only time the film picks up even little is when his shaved headed character in the long flowing beyaz caftan shows up on screen the others are horrendous goldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career but here he seems to have been replaced with lifeless pod from his invasion of the body snatchers his relationship with kate makes no sense they move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen preston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be somewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value an attempt to satirize stupid television we get self parody instead
the sequel to mission impossible is james bond wannabe film but it fails to even come close to that film in wit humor and entertainment value it tries to be spy romance movie but without any suspense the film just looks like it an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses it is film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human the coolest thing about this movie was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols the film plays as if it was wet fantasy dream about techie violence except for the choreographed action sequences the film was dull for three quarters of its time filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed as for the action scenes they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films but their advertisement for sadistic responses is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen opens and closes with fast paced action scenes but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue the film looks as if it had been invaded by computer virus at that point the only thing that kept me awake was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way it mega buck film adapted from popular high tech gadgetry tv series but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it and it failed to produce story that had any substance john woo broken arrow face off is good at doing car chases choreographed fights with midair flips and kung fu kicks slo mo shots of two guns blazing and of fire explosions but he just can seem to handle dialogue and suspense the star of the film and co producer tom cruise and his romantic interest thandie newton are miscast cruise is no james bond and looks more like yuppie than superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile as he tries to carry off this macho role while thandie is not an action film girl and seems like fish out of water in this one their romance didn work not only was it tepid and not sexy but it wasn convincing the film opens with dizzying speed perhaps with the hope that befuddled audience is its best bet for success we will be in three different locations instantaneously sydney the american southwest and seville first we are in sydney australia where scientist with muffled russian accent dr nekhorvich rade mentions that he created deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it he also mentions that every hero needs worthy villain which explains the film mythic theme as we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil the one who played the villain dougray scott does so in one dimensional gruff tone which did not distinguish him in that role at least if the film got the villain part right it might have had some fun with this nonsense soon the diabolical scientist is on plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains before they crash the plane and parachute out of it the one who was posing as dimitri turns out to be sean ambrose scott rogue member of the imf which is cia like clone he steals the package with the antidote peels off latex mask which is replica of the hero of the story ethan hunt cruise who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face off and in the original mission impossible which as convoluted plot as that film had it was still superior film to this sequel woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground as it is used so often in this film by both sides so much so that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense next we are in mountain range in the american southwest and ethan is on vacation hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool when helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard delivers via rocket launcher pair of talking sunglasses hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help billy baird john polson and luther stickell ving rhames with luther running high gadget computer but he also must get jewel thief named nyah hall thandie to join his team he is told as an incentive to recruit her all her criminal charges will be dropped hopkins then signs off with the tag line this message will self destruct in five seconds actually with the departure of hopkins it was this disposable film that actually self destructed at this point in seville hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of jewel heist and subsequent car chase where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of mountain road he also falls for her when this was only supposed to be business deal and learns that she is valuable because her ex boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to ck her the imf team then inject location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go ck him as she leads them to his hide out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort the south african hugh stamp richard roxburgh robert towne the screenwriter who contributed to the first mission who is noted for doing chinatown writes colorless pedestrian script one that fails even to be funny in camp way the terrorists who aim to rule the world are interested in owning 51 percent in biotech company and in getting stock options as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote insuring that they will make billions on the stock ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah with his only conflict being who is more important to save first ethan does this rescue against all odds as he finds way to penetrate security tight biotech company fight it out with sean and the other terrorists and rescue nyah who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean getting it as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on motorcycle using kick boxing winning shootout throwing full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists making some more use out of that peeling mask bit and by being completely fearless and larger than life while he kick everyone ass if was only entertained by this could have lived with it but this film was so badly made that it was like watching highlight film of basketball game seeing only the slam dunks but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast in any case this is critic proof film and will in all probability do well in the box office as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into
ex universal soldier luc has to battle group of newer model engineered fighters gone bad the review jean claude van damme has one liner early on in universal soldier the return his latest attempt to remain relevant that sums up this entire movie he says been there done that no film critic could possibly sum up van damme recent film choices any better while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him martial arts and guns this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world with legionnaire never seeing the inside of multiplex he joins fellow martial artist action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away universal soldier the return is truly poor the plot is complete copy of several action films from this decade specifically terminator judgement day and the similarly named soldier soldier kurt russell was an older model super soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors for the good of planet schwarzenegger terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from newer model killing machine the 1000 and jean claude former universal soldier has to save the planet from the rampage of group of you guessed it newer model soldiers considering the poor box office performance of soldier it amazing that this project was ever given the go ahead luc devereaux van damme was the sole remaining universal soldier or unisol for short until he was returned to normal if muscular human form in this sequel technically the fourth film in the series following two straight to video duds that were ignored here plot wise luc is now human trainer consultant of sorts for the unisol program working with dylan cotner xander berkeley who interestingly also appeared in t2 the unisol program has engineered tougher fiercer fighting force with the help of super computer seth unfortunately upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government seth takes control of his soldiers killing everyone in the building except for luc his partner maggie his daughter hillary and erin reporter trapped inside the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive while beating up group of near indestructible soldiers most notably romeo popular wrestler goldberg there are lots of fights gun battles lame plot developments and noticeable lack of plausibility there are so many clich in this film that it is almost painful to watch luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on and in the course of single night they go from bickering to falling for each other to kissing erin is pathetically written character people are getting brutally gunned down all around her and yet not only does this not seem to frighten her but she finds time to remind luc that she isn leaving without her story whatever other laughable moments include luc going to strip club to get internet access what and group of rangers who after having been given good advice luc tells them that their weapons are useless and shows them specific gun which should work better choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway guess who wins the battle not one single scene in universal soldier the return has any originality to it when fuelled by don davis loud driving music score the film many fights become almost passable but mostly are full of the same ol jean claude moves director mic rodgers former stunt co ordinator keeps the action coming at rapid pace with only few token serious moments to be found his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion if only jean claude weren getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li rodgers could probably have made decent action film to place the blame squarely at van damme feet however is an injustice not sure that anyone not even robert deniro or edward norton could make writers william malone and john fasano script sound good one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access he cringes looks down and mutters uh uhm they all do saw it on 60 minutes eh he he he the script and indeed the entire film only saving grace is goldberg he chews up every scene he is in obviously enjoying his role immensely he even gives the film few laughs as he mutters things like really don like that guy every time he fails to kill luc sadly his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier the return into anything better than below average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight to video
starring william baldwin cindy crawford steven berkoff all right the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role not that cindy does that bad it just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy extraordinary acting skills but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty but sure that that is just coincidence no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet well that just happy coincidence sure william baldwin isn bad actor unfortunately he just doesn demonstrate it at all in this movie not sure if that because most of his lines were just so hokey or if he was trying to make cindy acting look good if it was the latter it worked cindy does surprisingly good job here in her first movie which is not to say that she doesn have room for improvement although to be fair to cindy her lines were kinda cheesy in places so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet chose for her foray into the world of cinema well glad you asked that question cindy plays lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes target for former elite kgb agents why woud they target someone as likable as cindy you ask by the end of the movie you won care the story is so contrived it isn funny anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house without getting so much as scratch might add she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin who character max kilpatric police detective seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal early films the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin characters of the run from these killer russians isn all that bad of an idea it just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes if was baldwin hope this film disappears as for crawford she may indeed have some acting ability unfortunately any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks it too bad they hadn spent more time on half decent plot since ms crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much unless you are huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is movie that will only disappoint you
take look at the following equation christmas carol+ghostbusters=scrooged yes scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether scrooged is alternatively sick gross funny and then sickly soppy bill murray plays frank cross executive with horrible personality he evil to secretary actors crew everyone except the station boss of course played by the late robert mitchum however he is then visited by very dead exec who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts past present and future who is called the ghost of yet to come for some reason sure enough they arrive show cross how much of he is and he changes his way however throughout this simple plot we ve got to suffer outlandish special effects poor comedy and an very very mean performance from bill murray frank cross isn funny mean he just mean he also isn very good at emotional scenes and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is and how he has changed however the supporting cast are ok with good performances from mitchum allen who plays his girlfriend and john glover who plays cross partner the ghost of christmas past isn that bad either sadly though the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of home alone style violence from the ghost of christmas present played by carol kane whoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with toaster was funny should be fired straight away and the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait the guy with the annoying voice in police academy if remeber correctly who thankfully dosen say much the script is horrendous michael donaghue churns out terrible bad taste jokes which guess is the whole point really then changes direction completely to emotional scenes and he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes which are awful the special effects look nice but do nothing for the film there some impressive make up effects also the music is also good which is scored by danny elfman but great effects and make up don make great film scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience seeing as the first hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech why didn cross just look out his exec window and ask young boy to buy goose for him overall then you have much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided perhaps plague
synopsis maniac crazed by virulent microphage slaughters more than twenty people including street gang and heavily armed troops with small knife even with handgun however he can take out the two cops who are after him despite having shot one of them total of seven times comments the most notable aspect of adrenalin fear the rush is that it marks striking career move for natasha henstridge not only does she manage to keep all her clothes on her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans but welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles though admit it doesn show in this mess henstridge just like every other actor in the film delivers wooden performance in this monumental turkey the cast also includes christopher lambert who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films how on earth this movie got two big name stars to appear in it is beyond me adrenalin fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future 2007 boston has changed dramatically in those ten years it is now home to bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with policia printed on their doors some guy has really bad virus and he killing people because of it so the brave good guys lambert and henstridge go after him that it 76 minutes never seemed so long this is drawn out chase scene through dimly lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie the plot development is nil we learn absolutely nothing about lambert character and very little about henstridge character the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor tunnel airduct next and who will carry the flashlight subplot does exist involving henstridge character illegal attempt to get her son out of boston in her opening monologue monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure fake passport for her son twenty minutes into the film wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot in defining scene of the movie however changed my mind this fake passport drops to the ground lambert cop immediately recognizes it as fraud from six feet away must not have been good fake this emphasizes another fault with the film things just defy common sense lambert cop for instance is shot seven times yet he is still able to talk and slide about adrenalin fear the rush ends in trite manner that doesn seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for found myself rather bored with this film which will disappoint both sci fi horror fans and fans of henstridge and lambert don fear the rush fear the movie watch something else
post chasing amy slew of love triangle movies this month we have kissing fool co starring amy own lee and april brings us the object of my affection which may as well be titled chasing allan for it is the story of woman who falls in love with her gay roommate to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon about it that film stars schwimmer friend jennifer aniston if only kevin smith could write them all schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max who falls in love with his best friend jay lee book editor samantha avital mere twenty four hours after meeting her they are soon engaged and max because of his own raging libido grows suspicious of samantha fidelity he convinces jay to flirt with samantha during the development of his book to test her the trouble is jay might be secretly in love with her to stretch this flat sitcom premise to feature length the plot is framed by climactic wedding at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular tale the events leading up to the nuptials to an annoying fat man and his silly girlfriend hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue and lee poor lee is miscast so hysterically funny in chasing amy here he is forced to repress his comic instincts to swear to yell to talk about oral sex the script idea of character trait is to stress that jay is sensitive man and then show him drinking pepto bismol when he stewing over his girl trouble as for avital an israeli actress she is warm and sweet but we don know anything about her character other than that it takes her an incredibly long time to realize the most obvious things she also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer who plays schwimmer assistant and personal temptress turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on vertigo there are handful smattering of good scenes in kissing fool enjoyed moment in comedy club during which jay gets up and asks has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wanted to kill her over and over until he booted off stage there are also few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything that on the page kissing fool is never as clever as the thursday night joke machine friends that spawned schwimmer movie career so save yourself eight dollars and watch three episodes of that series back to back
yet another brainless teen flick this one is about surprise drugs and sex stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn look more bored their characters are cardboard cut outs of every cliched teenager out there one thing you need to know is really hated this movie everything about it annoyed the hell out of me the acting and script the plot and ending the director of the fluke hit swingers could have very well directed bunch of no name actors and had watchabe film the big stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality felt like was watching dawson creek episode 200 although the film still would have stayed at kirmizi despite its cast the surprise ending was sooo predictable since when is male character sudden outing of the closet considered surprise in hollywood anymore go is dawson creek varsity blues she all that go home and watch something else
set in harlem during the great depression rival gangster families go to war over control of the numbers an illegal gambling lottery runners take bets from potential lottery winners and deliver them to private locations for drawings the undisputed leader of the harlem numbers is the madame queen cicely tyson who is challenged by dutch schulz tim roth ruthless hoodlum by turning against the queen dutch defies his partner the infamous lucky luciano andy garcia who wishes to respect the queen and keep the peace the queens army strengthens when an acquaintance ellsworth bumpy johnson lawrence fishburne is released from prison and becomes bodyguard for her he proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt on himself and the queen and later takes control of the queens army when she is jailed for tax evasion bumpy reign is not as restrained and subdued as the queen and he declares all out war on dutch bloody gang warfare ensues bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign his new army questions his methods his girlfriend vanessa williams and the queen disagree with his violent solutions most importantly in his eyes dutch has become more formidable foe than he imagined and seeks help from lucky luciano to assassinate him there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it this movie is not original at all in fact was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and arguably the best gangster movie of all time the godfather if you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit why not borrow from lesser known movie say millers crossing how could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself here are just some of the major similarities stopped counting at 10 crooked cop assaults blood relative of the leader gang extracts revenge on crooked cop wife or girlfriend questions her partners murderous activities and leaves him high ranking officer betrays the leader blood relative of the leader murdered war erupting between the families high ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of other family members new leader runs family differently from previous leader large meeting with all families involved the setup in this movie is done rather well enjoyed the portrayal of the network of runners sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery this was the way of life in harlem and most people involved with the queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and put food on the table number running was the only way for the harlem population to find work also enjoyed the interaction between the angry violent dutch and the calm patient lucky after about the 30 40 minute mark all of the similarities with the godfather start appearing one after the other and in short order it was huge distraction and an insult to my intelligence who was the screenwriter kidding here some of the individual performances were well done andy garcia was very convincing as lucky unfortunately his screen time is reduced to supporting role tim roth effectively plays the cocky villain much like his roles in the cook the thief his wife and her lover and rob roy the good performances and convincing setup during the first third of the movie do not make up for the lackluster story that follows couple of coincidences is one thing over dozen is an insult directed by bill duke ellsworth bumpy johnson lawrence fishburne dutch schultz tim roth lucky luciano andy garcia the queen cicely tyson francine hughes vanessa williams illinois gordon chi mcbride written by randy turgeon january 22 1998
at first glance thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise its plotline goes like this the evil king cromwell desiring to take over the world resurrects an evil ancient sorceror xusia for power he attacks the kingdom of eh dan and kills young prince talon parents given triple bladed sword which can shoot bad guys like gun by his dying father talon vows for revenge eleven years later when he established his own army the mercaneries he vows to take back his kingdom along the way he meets up with alana whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell talon vows to help and after series of minor escapades eventually ends up rescuing alana brother and several other prisoners only to be captured himself in other words put on cross to be crucified fortunately he frees himself rescues alana from marrying cromwell defeats xusia and then cromwell all with his triple bladed sword during the final battle the blade breaks but talon finishes cromwell off by using hidden dagger in the blade then everything ends happily unfortunately the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds what would have been great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping bad acting and gruesomely gory bloody scenes never once does the story seem to connect together it just jumps around repeatedly this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia after telling him that he needs his help he leads the warlock out into daylight but then stabs him and sends him careening off cliff afterwards wait minute didn the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh dan which he cannot do by military force if that is the case why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him and why does he manage to take over eh dan anyway these questions are just never no never answered in the film another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana wedding to cromwell and finally at the end instead of settling down with alana he just tells her to wait and then he just rides off in addition to the extremely bloody scenes this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been great fantasy adventure even some attempts to make it exciting few fire scenes battle scenes don work it just completely fails altogether miserably the only good thing about this film is its musical score contributed by david whittaker who had an extremely short music composing career the score is boomy and adventurous powerful and billion times better than this film is my suggestion steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead if you can find it ironically though before the film credits roll there is message indicating that sequel tales of the ancient empire would follow to my relief and delight it never got into production because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office grossing only $39 million critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer all right leonard maltin rightfully called it second rate in scripting and acting and at glance film reviews called it confusing stupid unimaginative unengaging bloodfilled bore totally agree with these reviews all right and hope that this piece of #$% will be forgotten about there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer hope you get good laugh out of this review but am not laughing in fact my insults don even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time
this movie stinks although it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss knew was in for trouble when during the opening establishment shots we see detailed close up of warrant officer paul brenner john travolta military identification card and it is the wrong color this might seem like minor detail but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow and what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is recruit on his first day of training or what about when brenner tells suspect that because he is in the military he doesn have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision how hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts now details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through for example at the beginning of the film paul brenner an undercover army investigator gets into gun and knife battle at his off post houseboat and winds up killing an arms dealer he had been investigating the local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing but instead of arresting him or at least take him into custody for further questioning they release him duh ultimately brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding general daughter young captain also assigned to the post when brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the general daughter does he use them to generate suspect list and begin grilling suspects no his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing eventually brenner discovers that this murder is related to violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier won even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the army suppression of this horrendous crime will just mention one final flaw brenner is investigating crime that occurred in georgia the rape occurred in west point which is in new york he is under very tight and totally implausible 36 hour deadline to solve this case he needs to discuss the rape with psychiatrist at west point does he phone the doctor no he travels via some unexplained very fast transport to new york to question the psychiatrist in person and then he returns to georgia again by the miracle transport without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline you have been warned stay away from this one
it was not scary these are the first words that came to mind after it was over when movie is called _vampires_ not scary aren words that should be associated with it but that wasn my only gripe john carpenter is name associated with cutting edge cinema as in the intense scares of _halloween_ _the thing_ and _the prince of darkness_ or the offbeat action of _they live_ and _escape from new york_ unfortunately the only thing that is cutting edge about _vampires_ is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach with an anemic plot and not quite kosher special effects _john carpenter vampires_ has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan the film is at first concerned with group of roaming vampire slayers led by james woods of all people like some sort of holy team they even have their own souped up van the bunch invade and wipe out nest of vampires in new mexico shack their method is amusingly innovative the blood suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks to commemorate their victory the loutish band decorates motel room with hookers and parties the night away their celebration is short lived however as master vampire named valek ambushes and single handedly destroys most of the team woods jack crow and buddy montoya daniel baldwin escape with their lives along with woman named katrina sheryl lee although the woman has been bitten montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire the rest of the movie is concerned with the boys hunt for valek thomas ian griffith freaky marilyn manson type who on mission that dates back 600 years along the way they pick up priest named guiteau tim guinee character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl upham in _saving private ryan_ some stuff happens in the middle of the movie but can remember most of it because often found twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen _vampires_ finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix as crow guiteau and montoya assault an abandoned prison turned vampire nest only then does the film begin to even resemble carpenter flick but it too little too late we get the inevitable final confrontation but it seems tacked on and rather anti climactic come on we re dealing with _the_ master vampire here interestingly last summer vampire actioner _blade_ was derived from comic book and _vampires_ from novel yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former more deliberate superhero flick woods jack crow spouts glib off the cuff one liners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that oh so cool stride and his motive for killing vampires take wild guess hint ______ killed his _____ when he was just _____ at least _blade_ had decent action and slick stylishness _vampires_ lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer thin plot to make up for this the movie resorts to other shocks such as its generally condescending attitude towards women crow slaps them around for the fun of it and an overplayed contempt for religion crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to getting woodies it can be argued that maybe wanted too much from this movie if not scary and gory wanted tense relentless and exhausting _john carpenter vampires_ is none of these can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan for the rest of you looking for good scare beware _vampires_ is film with no teeth
perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with this is the fake news norm macdonald at times could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi offensive phrases in his raspy voice coated with condescending attitude his shtick was marked by crassness in this movie for example when his girlfriend says that she kicking him out because he been fired from 14 different jobs over the last months he tries to calm the situation by saying maybe you ll feel better after we have some dirty sex this kind of humor can only go so far but certainly can go the distance in full length feature dirty work is nothing more than sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically emotionally they ve never outgrown their pubescent years which is somewhat amusingly explored in beginning flashback although having no apparent real world skills the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people if the meter maid was unjust in giving you ticket then dump bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart mitch norm macdonald and sam artie lange need to come up with $50 000 in period of two weeks so that sam dad jack warden can have heart operation their idea is to start revenge for hire business where they ll do your dirty work in the funniest scene and possibly the only funny scene of the movie they take advantage of live television shoot at nearby used car lot their presence is established but when less than honorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge by default dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots but it delivers jerky boys level material except for the bit at the used car lot and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as prank phone call already weak on material it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs broads and also includes very unfunny chevy chase as bumbling doctor with gambling addiction but what really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying note to self note to self learn to fight he says after getting beat up note to self there always beer he says after hitting rock bottom etc we feel like we re just watching an elongated rehash of his not so glorious days on saturday night live much like the television show for 90 minutes we get one or two funny bits the rest of the story is just dead space
summer movies are by nature dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money wild wild west the latest will smith affair follows much the same formula except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies will smith plays jim west siyah sheriff with nice line in sunglasses he is called by president grant kline to go on mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon kline again and the two track the missing scientists to legless mastermind named dr loveless branagh with zany moustache before pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair ll give it chance with the positives there nice credit sequence the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye and the special effects are decent enough there also pleasant soundtrack buried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes and salma hayek pops up as the female interest which is always nice to see apart from these factors though nothing else in wild wild west works firstly there little chemistry between smith and kline who appears to be in it purely for the money one would expect zingers passing between the two none arise both of them plod through the below standard plot knowing that there is pay cheque waiting at the end not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment although he is over the top the material doesn present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy therefore he just comes across as loud as obnoxious the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek who is given so little screen time it embarrassing she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body and be ogled at by kline and smith her character also changes at whim to fit the mechanics of the script and there is no sense of realism about the character the humour in the film is also very off will smith put little spin to his daft lines in men in siyah here not even smith could save the humour on display the script largely boils down to insults that aren very funny and one liners that barely raise smirk it also somewhat racist although it doesn intend to be with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of lynching and actually says slavery is good to save himself it not funny scene and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably the film also makes the tragic mistake that man in this case kline in dress is automatically unfunny it isn but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness there also problems with the plot jim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying and rely purely on luck rather than audience pleasing skill plot elements are introduced into the film and then thrown away just as quickly the main piece of the story 80 foot mechanical steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive but there no particular reason why it should be built why not loveless build great big tank instead of an ungainly fragile piece of machinery that just begging to be blown up director barry sonnenfeld always has breezy look to them with some nice camera tricks but even this is missing from this stilted affair wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing but not much of it is evident making this film drag out even more it sad thing when _four_ credited screenwriters talented director and willing star can make film work and eventually wild wild west collapses under it sexist mildly racist unfunny weight
what were they thinking nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough but do we really need an eighties film robbie hart adam sandler used to want to be rock and roll star but in 1985 he singing at weddings and having good time romantic at heart he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his high school sweetie when she leaves him waiting at the altar his tune changes to love stinks he meets waitress julia drew barrymore who is engaged to junk bonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together in fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role but there is no spark barrymore doesn seem to be able to convey anything other than pretty face with nothing behind it beauty but no attitude both characters are just there bit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show the eighties are shoved in our face references to deloreans madonna dallas ivana and donald burt and loni and miami vice get old fast the filmmakers must have realized that there wasn much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions they re not funny and it doesn work with change on all fronts accelerating more and more nostalgia appears to have great appeal but don you think we could have more than 14 years before we yearn for the past maybe we can look forward to film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be
and just when you thought joblo was getting little soft around the corners not rating anything lower than your standard this movie sucks along comes this cinematic atrocity and he forced to take out his secret weapon and spray it with stench so thick even the bravest movie goer would think twice about seeing this waste of time yes despite being third sequel to successful original movie the latest highlander doesn seem to have anything going for it oh stinky movie let me count thee ways plot from what understood really bad highlander dude comes to the present looking to whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain their power and become the mightiest immortal or something along those lines critique complete and utter mess disjointed incoherent boring corny filled with bad dialogue and that just the first thirty minutes this film doesn seem to know what to do with itself it confusing to anyone who doesn know the series include myself in that group and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series include die hard highlander fan the arrow in that group the film doesn explain anything about itself it just goes from one inexplicable situation to another one moment they re in the present time the next moment they re in italy in the 1600s why who knows what are they talking about no idea flashbacks mixed in with the present mixed in with few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now and again and even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene hullo confused yet was and basically stopped giving crap about anyone in the film when realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of story random swordplay mad max like dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 1800s or were they in the present at that time who knows and to be honest who seriously cares this series should have been shot in the head and put out of its own misery long time ago but sadly someone at the studio decided that it still had little life left in it please please for the love of god and all that is holy in the world of movie making and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film put this series to bed and end it even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one the director also tries to do the best he can with the muddled material but all he could come up with is plenty of slo mo action some fast motion fight scenes and lots of smoke everywhere and is there anything spectacular about the sword play or fight scenes nope and think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face close ups yipes the man is not aging gracefully is he oh boy and haven even gotten around to the greatest piece of over acting that ve seen in years the man who plays kell in this movie bruce payne should get ham trophy for literally chewing up every piece of scenery that he gets near overacting is not hobby for this guy it living he also very funny not purposely though all in all the movie stinks nuff said
`bats is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan to pull something like this off you need to have sense of wit and style with heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines something like the underground worm thriller `tremors had just the perfect mixture of these elements and in return the film was tremendous fun with the notable exception of wisecracking supporting player `bats mainly plays it premise for straight arrow horror judging by the ridiculous premise this was not exactly wise move the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock `the birds but fails miserably done right it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema unfortunately `bats is prime example of formula movie done terribly terribly wrong the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be will recite the following paragraph in manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats is aimed toward those guys in hollywood have made movie about bats these bats are not very nice because they eat lot of people boy are these bats ugly they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super duper smart they ve got big claws and kirmizi eyes and they are not very friendly at all whole bunch of people in texas get killed so sheriff guy and scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with but the bats are pretty smart so it sorta hard to do the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good but no `bats is probably too violent for pre schoolers the film directed by louis morneau should have ventured straight into video stores on the small screen perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward although at few moments it becomes guilty pleasure the film is poorly written poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude even the bats themselves are cheesy and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey lou diamond phillips who embodies every pathetic stereotype small town authority figure usually portrays he chomps on cigar struts contentedly in his boots etc the scientist is dr sheila casper dina meyer who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her field meyer uses lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable but everything about dr casper is recycled beyond recognition her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `jaws everything revolving around `bats is tired drivel which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw with voices dubbed in later in fact that may have worked out better in the end take one glance at casper bat loathing sidekick jimmy leon and you ll have immediate deja vu he the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie constructed specifically for timed comic relief unfortunately none of his comic interludes are funny in the role of deranged mad scientist dr mccabe the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch mccabe `accidentally released two experimental test subjects and the virus spread to other bats the entire town of gallup texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else something like `when is the damn movie going to be over just want my money the bats are ugly must say there the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing but mainly the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been but by the absurdly stupid climax it way too late in the game for decent recovery characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire let explore the logic there is this really very efficient way to decrease the bat population you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one and after that there are only 18 000 more of them this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind `bats
the most interesting part of can hardly wait just happens to be not only the most human but for many of us the one part that many of us can easily relate to that is the character of denise lauren ambrose the film sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film and at one point sits down on couch and looks totally bored the film wisely holds over this moment nicely showing her alienation in the midst of large high school party almost too nicely for some members of the audience read me this is basically mirror of what going on with them watching this film we sit there wondering why we ve even bothered to see film about long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this after all this film is filled with bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which went to high school with everyone here the jock the homecoming queen the nerd and his dominions of trekkies and philes the alienated wannabe writer the school spirit girl the pothead the wigger etc etc etc and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial lame and basically as bunch of losers except for denise who rolls her eyes at everything and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks her yearbook entry something which is done for each main character quotes oscar wilde definite pointers there unfortunately the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film the film as said portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything however instead of sticking with this perhaps even going bit further with it they let this lie and actually make these characters into our heroes we follow several of them all bunch of moronic stereotypes with only shread of humanity and realism and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and or identified with them and if we did we certainly don want to revisit that state of being here quick low down it graduation and we follow bunch of seniors on the last night otherwise known as the american grafitti or to lesser extent the dazed and confused cliche the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly the latter did little bit of that and featured big outdoor keg party can hardly wait just opts for big indoor keg party and little bit of aimless driving albeit of the whining because can get girl want brand we follow many people around but mostly we trail preston ethan embry of that thing you do the alienated writer who been pining over the homcoming queen amanda the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared moment their freshman year over freaking pop tart now that she broken up with her football player boyfriend mike peter facinelli he decides to go to the party with note he written declaring his love for her in the hopes he ll build up the guts to give it to her even though he leaving for multi week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut okay the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson since that plot is incredibly lame and track record of what goes on with it wouldn be able to carry commercial let alone feature film and because it party there are some more main characters such as william charlie korsmo finally surfacing after dick tracy the nerd and his dominions who has come up with ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike who humiliated him for years but gets too caught up in drinking to do it kenny seth green the wigger who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid uh huh and denise the only exceptional character who unfortunately gets stuck in bathroom don ask with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point to point with nary bit of characterization involved after awhile ugh the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not american grafitti or dazed and confused two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers not to mention were extremely entertaining but to john hughes films of the 80s most notably sixteen candles the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion this film forgets to satirize its characters and ultimately tells story about bunch of uninteresting stereotypes and then says that it all okay we can take this film seriously nor can we take this as fun so really what good is it but will tell you some things did like liked the direction except for couple too over the top features like way too glossy jump cuts it like an oxymoron and other obscurities generally though elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement and even manage to capture an altman esque feel to their film from time to time thing with note though is too hokey to really be admirable actually did like seth green for once in about decade when he played very young woody allen in radio days his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable almost and of course lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise the one character we could have used some more of even though it would have changed the entirety of the film however the character of denise really doesn work with the film when really thought about she far too witty and realized at least for the first half to belong in this film and whenever she appears she automatically gives everything delightfully satirical tone she not just the cynic or the intellectual she just very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters she may ruin the film more but at least when she on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves well at least we ll be entertained couple other things that just don work mike character who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general the aimless bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda give me break and perhaps the one thing that just doesn work at all jenna eflman uncredited cameo as an angel just didn work but nice try basically the worst thing about this film the real reason giving this such low rating is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we do we don feel for these characters because for most of us we aren stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots the acid test for high school movies is does it at all capture the feel of what it portraying the answer for this film is no nice try though
alcohol and drugs bad not alcohol and drugs good got it just when you though you ve seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen be that insanity or alcoholism hollywood releases yet another one of those deep emotional stories about finding yourself 28 days is practically visualization of the usual meaningful true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa meetings gwennie sandra bullock is young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol for her life was big party with no beginning and no end this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper dominic west borrowed her sister elizabeth perkins wedding limo and crashed it into someone house this time she had to pay with 28 day stay in court ordered rehab here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption willpower and commitment most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just big party the film itself feels like rehab program whining and moaning about things that have been said and written million times it is classic cautionary tale an echo big fat and expensive clich shadow of last year girl interrupted which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like the cuckoo nest and trainspotting director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film drama comedy jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues alienation despair terror confusion loneliness and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean isn that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place even the transition process itself seems like walk in the park betty thomas idea of hell is cozy homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke drink or watch tv after 11 it is simply too light simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story all you need to do is just say no says dr cornell steve buscemi as if was the revelation of the century and that how simple it is in fact would rather watch lost in space once again than return to 28 days as for acting it acceptable but hardly anything else for sandra bullock it an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than speed she handles her part with surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being complete flop dominic west shines as the source of gwenie devilish temptations but elizabeth perkins and steve buscemi great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters although intellectually girl interrupted was greater achievement 28 days is superior in its visual aspect there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor the most important thing is that we ve seen it before and it was lot better clean and sober only when laugh when man loves woman leaving las vegas and many other stronger films were made about the same issues so what the point in other words 28 days doesn contribute to the moviemaking business on any level if you re caught in snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you re standing in front of the movie theatre you might as well go in and watch 28 days under all other circumstances stay away because this film equals $8 and 103 minutes lost
capsule combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark dash of jackie chan movie sans jackie two teaspoons of gun and swordplay and dollop of cgi simmer for 100 minutes yields zilch the phantom is depressing and tired retread of so many earlier better movies that after the fifteen minute mark started cataloguing them out loud it hard to make good action adventure movie that doesn simply recycle its predecessors and ve seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully the phantom allegedly based on the long running comic of the same name doesn even bother to be graceful it stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list but ll try the film opens up with prelude sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given heavy voice over to compensate for whatever got thrown out we go from there to jungle sequence that swear to god recycles the truck chase scene from raiders of the lost ark note for note possibly even shot for shot right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush and then goes on to rip off the rope bridge scene from sorcerer as well sorcerer as you may well remember was remake of french movie the wages of fear in which bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain both versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick but ve got my job to do so back to the salt mines we go anyway the cinematic theft doesn stop there or at least the lack of inspiration there isn single thing here we haven seen and it not given to us in way that remotely evokes our interest we have where my list bad girl tough good girl secret cave hideaway which seems inspired more by dr no than anything else boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality magical artifacts of terrible power and cary hiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear fu manchu mustache and sneer lot and generally humiliate himself what else is there the plot is waste of time the sets alternate between big but hokey and tiny and still hokey there are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked and sure once mike and the bots get the cash they ll stick it on their sked the only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane he good actor and he tries very hard even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of scene after another all can say is that pray this isn the beginning of the end for him although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comic book super hero movie
new entry in the revisionist history genre of filmmaking dick suggests that two not too bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation biggest presidential scandal kirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene who while trying to deliver fan letter from arlene watergate hotel room accidentally stumble across gordon liddy played dead on by harry shearer and the infamous break in when they recognize liddy later on during beyaz house field trip they are ushered into conference room questioned as to what they know and leave as official presidential dog walkers the girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with when they discover that nixon another dead on performance by dan hedaya who actually favors nixon slightly unlike anthony hopkins has been abusive to checkers the presidential dog thanks to the conversations that he always recorded they quit and become disillusioned during prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president resignation this film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king type talk show featuring cameo by french stewart about revealing the identity of deep throat from there we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad dick joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy at one point the girls are having to scream over high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial the band manages to stop right as dunst screams you have to stop letting dick run your life much to the horror of everyone standing within earshot several other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film if this movie had been smarter would have been less likely to fault it juvenile bathroom humor but it not the film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience throat in the least subtle way possible don recall oliver stone nixon having to pander to it audience but of course that film wasn comedy aimed squarely at 13 20 year old film going audience the only redeeming thing about this movie is it remarkable supporting cast wanted to see more of ferrell and mcculloch woodward and bernstein those two characters are the sole basis for my rating wish they had been given more screen time but unfortunately they are only relegated to the final half hour their constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are major highlight especially mcculloch constant thwarting of ferrell attempts to gather information from the girls who in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat so named thanks to an ill planned trip to porno theater by betsy brother the other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters but are given nothing to work with like to see the same cast portray these characters in script more suited towards their comedic abilities as for the two leads dunst and williams can definitely do better they come off as what could best be described as romy and michele the early years in this particular film highly dubious distinction at best stay through the first half of the end credits though to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie an excellent idea marred by poor execution dick could have been great movie less of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes could have made this film wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds as it stands though dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as dick and poopie jokes and that to me does not make funny movie [pg 13]
words thought never write the sequel to urban legend lacks the grace wit and power of the original put the gun to my head pull the trigger and put me out of my misery better yet put the horror genre out of its misery when you ve finished watching urban legends final cut you ll share my same grim point of view thanks to the horrible acting terrible script and ridiculous directing which has become all too common today urban legends final cut is smorgasbord of stolen movie ideas mainly from the blair witch project and scream fabulous people with perfect teeth and skin one creepy film school and dog eating freshly removed kidney from one of the movie hapless victims urban legends delivers story about bunch of film students working on their thesis films to win the coveted hitchcock award which guarantees the winner director deal in hollywood one female filmmaker jennifer morrison the freaky dead girl from stir of echoes writes fiction script based on serial killer who kills his victims according to urban legend tales suddenly her entire crew starts getting bumped off with urban legendary homicides but the bodies are always missing and she is often the only witness to the killings the killer wears fencing mask and long siyah overcoat looking like scorned olympian out to avenge his defeat in sydney why this is scary is never explained of course the golden rule of sequels is that there must be least one recurring character for continuity sake urban legends has one minor recurring character from the original who we never cared about anyway the security guard of all people the other central problem is that this character has already seen the urban legend killings once before but she utterly clueless about what going on around her call it suspension of disbelief this film is also prime example of how horror films are now completely dead in the water the last decent horror film was the blair witch project and that seemed more like snuff film than fiction the stalking killer with crazy motivation has become tired clich as everyone seems to have forgotten real horror is not about what is seen but about what is unknown
godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the who cares about plot summer movie loose remake of the 1954 classic japanese monster movie godzilla king of the monsters which is itself pretty thin in the story department roland emmerich and dean devlin big budget lizard stomps manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind the script isn just dumbed down it lobotomized godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone presumably the primary target group for this film is teenage boys the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster instigated carnage that not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction they re just not as readily susceptible this is the third straight movie in row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that mastery of computer generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors stargate was financial success independence day was runaway hit and with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie ins before it even opens it virtually guaranteed at least $100 million nice numbers for film that could have been penned by not too precocious grade school kid godzilla isn completely without merit although it is close there certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan but it wears off quickly frankly while the special effects are competent they re not all that stunning there nothing new here it jurassic park meets aliens with little independence day thrown in for bad measure maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer generated visuals to the next level godzilla never really pushes the envelope preferring to remain within comfort zone the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by crass formulaic approach which disallows creativity how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival worst of all godzilla isn even exciting with the possible exception of mildly enjoyable car chase near the end there isn sequence in this film that raises the pulse even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn provoking independence day may have been dumb but it was full of adrenaline moments capable of getting the audience involved in the action in this aspect of its production as in so many others godzilla is lacking actually part of the problem is that we re never sure who we re supposed to be rooting for the green monster with an attitude or the paper thin humans trying to stop him the plot such as it is can be summed up rather simply after sinking few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands godzilla shows up in the big apple he does some of the usual tourist things stops by madison square garden visits the chrysler building goes on walk through central park and takes the subway in the process he knocks over few buildings and steps on countless cabs but he never has trouble with traffic jams on hand to stop him is an elite army unit led by slightly less arrogant than usual military man kevin dunn and biologist named nick tatopoulos who has theory about godzilla in his opinion the big guy is actually lizard grown to enormous proportions as result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific in nick words godzilla is mutated aberration an incipient creature the first of its kind as luck would have it nick old girlfriend audrey maria pitillo is reporter based at new york tv station along with her cameraman friend animal hank azaria she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla then just when the military has rejected nick theory about why godzilla is in new york member of the french secret service jean reno recruits him for special assignment instead of stomping around tokyo this time godzilla has chosen new york city unfortunately manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies independence day deep impact armageddon that it becoming boring the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall he could climb the empire state building at ten times that height godzilla would be more likely to knock it over godzilla contains few lame attempts at humor there an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit com material an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick last name properly and rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film ebert the mayor of new york is played by michael lerner and gene lorry goldman is his campaign manager ebert re election slogan is not surprisingly thumbs up for new york the siskel ebert stuff is amusing the first time it used but after while it grows tiresome and although the characters don serve any real purpose they keep popping up godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast this is largely because emmerich doesn want to risk human performance upstaging his lizard that not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren capable of good performances both have done their share of solid acting in the past but they aren list names then again considering the quality of the writing even pacino and deniro would have been hard pressed to shine maria pitillo dear god plays the love interest and hank azaria great expectations is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief ultimately it doesn really matter what or any other critic for that matter have to say about the movie tristar has assumed that godzilla like all self proclaimed summer event motion pictures is pretty much critic proof it may also be word of mouth proof those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what write or their friends say so when go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time it like spitting into the wind emmerich and devlin are master illusionists waving

in times of crisis people are driven to desperate measures of course what constitutes crisis differs from person to person what may be disastrous situation for one may be seen as challenge to another as deepak chopra is known to say it not the ride it the rider unfortunately clear thinking is not always the reaction to problems wall street wheeler dealer steven taylor michael douglas is man with troubles he sunk his money in illegal financial activities and it blown up in his face in matter of days he will lose it all his wife emily gwyneth paltrow is highly placed un interpreter and is not happy with her life either her marriage is cold and unfulfilling unknown to her her new lover david shaw viggo mortensen is not only painter but an ex con with history of bilking wealthy women of their money emily is prime target she worth over $100 million steven solution to his predicament is to offer david half million to kill his wife the artist accepts and the movie is underway drawing from frederick knott play and loosely based on hitchcock dial for murder this is all too typical of summer releases all style and no substance and there really not much style director andrew davis the accomplished witness and best forgotten other films has made exactly the wrong choices at almost every turn douglas and paltrow have both shown us that they are skillful actors in previous films mortensen showed promise in the past here all three are walking uninterestingly through their roles with oddly waxen faces the only person who shows any sense of life is david suchet as new york detective mohamed karaman he only on screen long enough to make you think that there might be likable person in the film and then he disappears the first concern of suspense film is to create suspense surprises are important in this movie the audience keeps waiting for something to happen and nothing ever does nearly every event is telegraphed in advance close up on this object or that action and it easy to guess what going to happen as the film plods towards its inevitable conclusion you keep expecting plot twist to make the movie worthwhile it hopeless quest the story doesn make much sense steven wife is loaded even with unfriendly relations you think that he could have talked to her about his difficulty rather than deciding to kill her when he does decide on the dire plan he makes an unreasonable choice if you were going to hire someone to kill your wife would your first choice be her lover no matter how sleazy he is would think there might be chance that he would turn down the opportunity why would steven plan the murder as break in in their apartment why not just take her out as she was walking to david loft in bad neighborhood while deciding among the numerous summer films you might do well to skip this one you ll find more suspense than this movie offers by watching the weather channel
virus is monster movie without monster any movie with hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise sadly virus does not deliver on any level the movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something we never find out what to big boat with lots of satellites on it sudddenly wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space and winds up destroying mir and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat cut to seven days later we meet donald sutherland and his band of seafaring vultures see they spend all their time sailing around looking for dead in the water ships to rescue and then collect the reward money at least think that what they do along with many other things in the film their reason for being out in the middle of the ocean isn really explained so they stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites on it and decide to haul it back to russian waters the only problem is the crew starts disappearing one by one and turning into borg yes borg complete with the kirmizi laser beam in place of an eye apparently this alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical so it creates make shift machines and uses humans for spare parts blah blah blah could go on forever describing the ludicrous so called plot but won suffice it to say the most original thing about this movie is having donald sutherland play an irish man everything else in this movie has been taken from other better movies for example many of the machines resemble those found in the little seen japanese movie tetsuo the iron man and the plot is right out of aliens the funny thing is was actually expecting to enjoy this movie have soft spot for cheesy monster movies like last years under appreciated deep rising but virus as mentioned earlier doesn even have monster it just has big pile of circuits and wires and expects the audience to fear this ridiculous looking contraption virus is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it besides the lame monster it chock full of dialogue that no real person would ever say and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into for example there is scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to negotiate with the alien now don know about you but if came upon lifeform that viewed mankind as virus to be eliminated doubt that would attempt to reason with it that makes about as much sense as baby squirrel calmly asking fierce predator to spare his life finally virus isn scary the least the filmmakers could have done was to make the movie just little scary as it is it about as frightening as box of cookies skip virus if it cool monster movie you want rent the far superior and the granddaddy of this genre aliens

barb wire pamela anderson lee first foray into films highlights the fact that her only talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets being the only notable member of the cast the camera lingers lustily her body at every opportunity making her character catch line don call me babe sound very ironic indeed from the very opening of the movie we are treated to striptease routine from anderson ending in her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes of lusty male who happened to call her babe throughout the movie there is ample footage of enormous breasts and cleavage if not of anderson then at least of the female extras this alone is enough to retitle the movie babe wire for plot barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline it is 2017 the middle of the second american civil war and barb wire former resistance fighter runs joint in steel harbour called hammerhead known for attracting resistance fighters an characters of all sorts the bar attracts the attention of the government forces who appear dressed in nazi style uniforms in between bashing up helpless males and showing off her trademark breasts barb wire has to help former lover and his wife get to the airport on the other side of the town past the government controlled areas and to freedom even the airport looks like the one in casablanca except that the plane in the background is modern private jet there are hardly any significant moments in this film and one gets the impression that it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version of barb wire if anything one leaves the film with the confirmation that anderson di not do her own stunts who could fight and jump in skimpy strapless leather top and yet keep her breasts from spilling out only stuntwoman not pamela anderson lee
humanities quest for knowledge never ends so team of scientists and film makers travel to the amazon to search for legendary indian tribe the party consists of anthropologist steven cale eric stoltz and the camera team consisting of terri flores jennifer lopez danny rich ice cube gary dixon owen wilson denise kahlberg kari wuhrer and warren westridge jonathan hyde early on their journey they meet paul sarone jon voight whose boat is stuck on the shore they agree to give him ride to the next village he claims to know the area well and can be useful locating the native tribe very soon their friendliness backfires on the group because sarone turns out to be snake hunter without scruples who only wants to catch giant anaconda and sell it to zoo we don have to wait too long for the giant snake she just had panther hors oevre and now is looking for the main course our heroes paddle around in the amazonas as if it were the pool in their own backyard no wonder giant animals mistake their splashing for dinner bell our anaconda is polite one and swallows the first victim in one big gulp enjoy so much for the first attempt to catch her but who would want to catch giant snake with fishing pole our villain sarone shows his soft side when he stops terri from shooting the snake too bad that anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition one by one she goes after the others eric stoltz is stung by giant wasp right in the beginning and is mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure the rest of the crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not the way the makers of the movie had planned however the scenes without the anaconda are rather boring whenever the leading lady shows up we re in for laugh the snake reminds us of favorite character of famous animated movie even if she should be an awe inspiring monster her attacks always follow the same plan one last hypnotic look she looking at you kid then she speedily wraps herself around her victim and starts to gush it down mostly we don see the act of devouring but she looks nice when she wiggles away with her bulging middle part whoever did the special effects on this movie may have wanted to go to zoo first and study some real snakes maybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real the animatronics are somewhat more believable but that didn work for the strangling scenes don go see the movie for the they are everything but up to date the viewer who likes to watch the end credits will see to his her surprise that snake expert was consultant for the team we may doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work well known american science magazine is also mentioned in the credits but will refrain from naming it here to avoid further damage to its reputation the majority of viewer will have left the theater as soon as the credits start rolling anyway what kind of audience is the target group for this movie hard to say this can be serious horror movie or can it see for yourself
absolute power the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood attempts to be thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff it is about as thrilling as lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence continually underestimating the audience the film gives us information we already know or dont even need details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night vision goggles in their car oddly enough the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities masterful jewel thief played by clint eastwood witnesses the murder of the wife of powerful millionaire played by marshall while robbing one of marshalls mansions he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault there through two way mirror he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay their game of love quickly turns into violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman in self defense the woman grabs letter opener and stabs the man in the elbow she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men the man he is the president of the united states of america where does the film go wrong it cannot be the acting clint eastwood ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type cast but decent performances the cinematography is sufficient wild and erratic during action sequences dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller suspense genre the fault clearly lies in the screenplay and the screenplay alone while setting up story about misuse of power about the true possessors of that power and about intrigue and double crossing it does not resolve it not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax rather the tense situations are left dangling at the end giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness an example of this is very promising and tense buildup of scene in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood the police have set up trap at small restaurant police officers are everywhere incognito of course at the same time not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives all three parties are unaware of each others presence this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood who might suspect this is trap will get himself out of this difficult position he will probably have brilliant plan involving ingenious preparations however when he arrives at the trap both hit men miss how convenient and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap the scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter the daughter blames her father for never being there for her because he was either in jail or robbing house somewhere of course their relationship takes turn for the better during the adventure and they end up happy family again it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for dramatic subplot however trying is simply not enough the second story line should be subtle original and preferably unpredictable everything this film is not how could screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced how could eastwood who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven ever believe in project like this one am sad to say that my respect for the actor director producer has diminished substantially due to this film director quentin tarantino once said can make good movie out of any bad script director clint eastwood obviously cannot

book should have remained in shadows book of shadows blair witch film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman certain things in our lives are inevitable death sorrow love heartbreak pain joy we expect these events we know they re going to happen and some we even look forward to it part of the human condition we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society as we near the fall election several of them are hitting us in the face politicians exaggerate their own importance our side is always right theirs is always wrong in the end voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if film makes big money there will be sequel even if the original story doesn merit one even if the first film is complete in itself even if success is fluke the blair witch project was made with budget of $1 75 and exploded on the screen raking in huge profits the concept was brilliant the filmmakers created remarkable buzz that the story might be real the film itself was even more convincing the movie _must_ be authentic why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen the first film caught lightning in bottle the sequel proves you can pour that old lightning into new bottle you have to give this effort some credit it would have been easy to have made the same movie again with new group of kids it would have been easy but of course it wouldn have worked instead book of shadows acknowledges the first film as movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release it great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do sequel unfortunately it doesn work either five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives even weirder stuff happens some people die there blood and knives and none of the characters have lick of common sense while supposedly doing serious research the group sets up circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to stay alert all night awaiting visitation then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud very obnoxious heavy metal music it bad plan the cast shows some early promise couple is doing research on blair witch book the tour guide is former mental patient turned ebay aficionado goth amazon princess adds bit of comedic relief the obligatory hot babe is the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick the cute wiccan chick the first film unaccomplished actors came across as real people in real situation because hours and hours of video were shot during days in the woods this time these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors there not one character you care about when they start shouting for no reason although what passes for plot starts out with solid idea it ruined by poor execution the follow up to one of the most successful horror films ever is nothing more than bad slasher movie they re trapped in an old big weird house they stupidly separate into various rooms there are strange noises they see scary apparitions and people disappear ever see this movie seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better the film features mostly cheap tricks and unnecessary gore for storyline filled with surprises it oddly predicable the blair witch project was rare triumph of style over substance the book of shadows is triumph of tedium over promise
the crown jewel of 1970 irwin allen disaster movies the poseidon adventure features an all star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on cruise ship the story begins on the poseidon big new year cruise where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive let see there the new age preacher hackman who advises people to pray to that part of god within yourself there the ex cop borgnine who busted hooker stella stevens six times then married her there the hippie singer there got to be morning after who turns to the company of lonely man kirmizi buttons once her brother is killed and to round out the group the elderly couple jack albertson and shelley winters who live aboard the ship the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall we get to know these people little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure before straight faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship everyone in the giant ballroom at the time shortly past midnight of the new year when the ship turns first on its side then completely upside down the second in command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on quest to the top of the ship in this case because the ship is overturned the top is the bottom or is the bottom the top either way we get to see lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and in the ballroom scene christmas trees thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors through burning rooms etc while the ship slowly fills with water behind them it race against the clock which is only mildly interesting the poseidon adventure works more as bad movie to laugh at with all the melodrama that comes in between the non thrilling action scenes the one note in borgnine one note performance is to be cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love although since there isn sex scene we never find out if his buttons really are kirmizi and albertson and winters wonder if they ll live to see their grandson birth shelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in scene toward the end where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with rope for the rest of them to pull along winters who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie stevens even not so affectionately calls her fatass in one scene finally finds her purpose was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when was seventeen she brags and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years she swimming through the water her skirt billowing up around her hips showing off her cellulite or do you call it shellulite ridden thighs it not so much funny as innately disgusting which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as whole
while watching loser it occurred to me that amy heckerling true genius as film maker is casting in fast times at ridgemont high she gave us sean penn jeff spicoli in look who talking she turned bruce willis into wise cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival in clueless she found star vehicle for the adorableness that is or was alicia silverstone she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws unfortunately she may also be starting to understand that she understands giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies giving appealing actors script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser naturally heckerling makes her protagonist an all around swell guy paul tannek jason biggs is small town boy who gets scholarship to nyu then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold hearted big city paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman his roommates adam zak orth chris tom sadoski and noah jimmi simpson are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar in this case the lovely dora diamond mena suvari dora has problems of her own including shortage of funds to pay her tuition and relationship with professor edward alcott greg kinnear that more than slightly one sided they re two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people so clearly they belong together even if paul is loser must confess that for while was suckered in by heckerling casting jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace suvari is coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence they re pleasant enough to watch and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren then it gradually becomes clear that there virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort in theory loser is romantic comedy but there is scarcely laugh to be found in the entire film notable exception cameo by scene stealing comic actor as video store clerk instead of taking any time to make the characters situations funny heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters situations pathetic she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless nor any of that film interest in lively plotting not surprisingly since clueless plot came via jane austen emma she simply turns the film into pity party since loser is film composed almost entirely of establishing character you might think that those characters would be interesting or at least slightly complicated instead you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there no reason to watch them paul isn just nice guy he flawless consequently he central character who does absolutely no growing his roommates aren just inconsiderate they re actively evil blackmailing professor alcott drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity bad name and professor alcott isn just manipulative he turns dora into his house slave dora unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser and even that isn explored in sufficient detail there more ambiguity in the 30 second snippet from alan cumming broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations it another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow don know comic still spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora that hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkel scarborough fair canticle instead of giving the sequence knowing wink reference to the graduate hint that paul is becoming an overly sensitive clich heckerling plays it deadly straight even in the scenes that scream for light comic touch and bit of poke at her protagonist foibles she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint clueless cher had her self absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness in loser amy heckerling shows leaden hand with material that demands friskiness her one show of wit involves naming paul dorm hunt hall after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall her gift with casting proved to be her curse loser may be crashing bore but gee aren those two kids swell
capsule john the baptist is sent from heaven to see is the world is worth saving he must find some sign of hope in the people of newfoundland this is little more than tv skit in movie form it is watchable and apparently will be released to theaters in canada but it is unlikely to be seen on the international market it is diverting but hardly serious piece of cinema to +4 minor spoilers in this review written and directed by john doyle john the baptist sent to st john newfoundland gets an invitation to live with family that extraordinary hospitality for some reason does not count as reason for hope script has lot of holes friend who adopts john is surprisingly militant and is planning actions to destabilize wall street john does look middle eastern but somehow one expects john the baptist to be more dramatic there is conspiracy in the vatican riding on the result of the visit though that result seems small compared to the end of the world big yucks like seeing nun give the pope pedicure and evil pope aid praying to mendes goat in large part satire of life in newfoundland taking licks at things like the poor produce the one good tomato in grocery by virtue of miracle must have fallen off the truck to toronto based on 20 minute short film
the disney stick to what you do best rule states that disney animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their hand at live action kids entertainment they will fail miserably this goes double for occasions when they try to make live action adaptation of popular cartoon remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations still trying to forget that rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget an insulting despicable and worst of all expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as viable children film it will bore anyone over five and should prove unbearable for adults even at its relatively skinny running time of 80 minutes it films like this that make me want to go to my local blockbuster and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects just as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor yet his career takes nosedive to hell with his role as john brown depressed security guard with big heart who hopes that one day he can become real policemen and help the people around him he dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush dr brenda bradford joely fisher but after few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer john breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr brenda father dr brenda has been working on gadget project which would make half man half machine super policeman to fight crime feeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject realizing his dream of becoming policeman now when he says go go gadget [insert name of gizmo here] he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks bang up bandits and mangle murderers in the meantime the evil claw rupert everett the man responsible for the murder of the good doctor father is building gadget of his own carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john brown worst nemesis claw has plans of world domination which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile voice of hughley to save humanity from his wrath state of the art effects fly at mad pace in this $90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up convincing atmosphere had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect what we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of meal all of the expensive amounts to nothing part of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie can kids really admire hero so goody two shoes that he screams hey you ran stop sign while hanging off the back bumper of quickly moving vehicle think that today children will respond better to somebody dashing someone ultra cool they probably receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see father figure kick butt in addition to the more complex complaints above there also the simple stuff inspector gadget is boring formulaic and achingly implausible there no feeling that the director really cares about his story more than any other film ve seen this year this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line there popular commercial for sprite but that irrelevant running in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects it consists of studio suits discussing fictitious thank god movie called death slug each executive gleefully presents different merchandise tie in slug taco slug on stick at the end one of them asks what about the movie another answers well we don have script yet but we can bang one out by friday they probably could have replaced death slug with inspector gadget this film contains the sort of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script it no coincidence that most good children entertainment these days comes from animation animated features take so long to maker that it becomes labor of love for the filmmakers and they put care and pride into their work these kinds of films are banged out quicker and good percentage turn out worthless sloppy and impersonal the studios are becoming factories and films their assembled products 1999 eugene novikov&#137
as the twin surfer dudes stew and phil deedle lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother yanking out his iv he uses it like water pistol to soak his brother face this bit of lame physical humor is typical of disney meet the deedles movie more to be endured that watched stopped looking at my wife during the screening since every time did she start sticking her finger in her throat and she right it is that bad directed without any imagination by steve boyum whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction the film limps along at best boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts stunts and more stunts amazingly for someone with his background he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones and we have car go off the road five different times maybe more but who counting and then there is the script by james herzfeld whose only other film tapeheads from decade ago was so awful that it is considered cult classic meet the deedles however is painfully bad rather than laughably bad it will probably be in and out of the theaters like tornado and is in no danger of becoming classic anything herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes your geyser geezer and like to put deedle in her haystack as the movie opens the twins who at one point describe themselves modestly as walking kodak moment are celebrating their 18th birthday as they ride parasail high above the waters of waikiki truant officer pursues them on his jet ski as heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid back beach bums into men as they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone they ve got their surfboards skateboards and hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire their camp has gone out of business but they are mistaken for new park rangers the rest of the movie has them fighting the park overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as deranged ex ranger played by dennis hopper who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration scheduled for later in the week hopper who has made some wonderful movies carried away being recent favorite does have propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material this isn his worst acting but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he ever been in steve van wormer and paul walker as stew and phil give lifeless performances the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is cute little prairie dog named petey even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull to add insult to injury hennings is fond of inappropriate close ups which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog put ten foot pair of lips on the screen and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said although boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie stunt of lying on your back on skateboard while negotiating busy and twisting mountain road they make it look like so much fun that sure many will try some variation of the stunt how could this possibly be worst asks phil just when you suspect it can the movie takes turn further downhill its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag after phil girlfriend digs up big mount of moist soil they suck in long worm like the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp their lips finally meet in kiss as they pull back their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested meet the deedles runs about an hour and half it is rated pg for little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around and up my son jeffrey and his friend nickolas both almost gave the show they both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives jeep and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo
bicentennial man is family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment chris columbus the director who gave you mrs doubtfire plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point based on the short story by isaac asimov it is supposed to be science fiction story about robot who wants to be human which as you can imagine is very difficult starting in not too distant future the film concentrates on wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children soon this robot called andrew robin williams shows abilities that makes his owner mr martin sam neill very curious andrew is interested in art and music he enjoys making clocks which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions it shows out that because of small failure in the electrical circuits and positronic brain andrew has accidentally gained soul this makes him unique and his evil creators worried then mr martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn programmed to do soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom destiny and love this film can be described as disney version of blade runner film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction ever since that film the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy what makes us human the thoughts the emotions is it possible to become human at what point can we say to robot now you are one of us these are very tough questions that require serious and thurral approach it is obvious that columbus didn take them very seriously when you think about it this film is not really meditating on the question when is robot no longer machine but human being but tells story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as human being and only the society has troubles with it in other words it is as far from reality as from the academy awards further more there are other annoying problems to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now this has not been done for obvious reasons because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such difficult task columbus is the first to have crossed that line the result is as you might imagine primitive unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort the world is simply frozen in time neither the society fashion culture or values have changed over 200 years mom is still working at the kitchen doing the dishes when you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today you ll see slightly bigger difference am not saying that everything should change it is unlikely that the human rights will change but it even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science technology and fashion suppose it possible to watch this as some sort of bizarre fairytale but it really hard robin williams is hidden behind and speaking in robotic way as always he does decent job as does sam neill but it doesn really matter it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into tiresome experience pretty much like last year meet joe siyah this is primitive and unresolved story which is presented with splendor and professionalism that it doesn deserve great actors and talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten when isaac asimov wrote this story the future seemed far away and magical everything seemed possible now is the future of asimov time and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed long time ago for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne 20 000 leagues under the sea so can we accept this story as potential reality let us hope that next year will be more rewarding
in the continuation of warner brother franchise joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow what makes this film such grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film avika goldsman screenplay is such cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another this coming on the heals of such marvelously written project as the client is such shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was fluke situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone batgirl who just happens to be alfred niece the story of dr victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought while working on cure for tragic decease contracted by his wife dr freeze is injured during cryogenic procedure and becomes man who can only survive in sub zero environment now of course he has become terrorist intent on turning the world into frozen planet where only he can live now the logic of that little sub plot escapes me if mr freeze wanted to find cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death why would he want to have her live in world with no warmth this is indeed cold hearted man the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory she wants to breed form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal she joins with mr freeze in his plan to start new ice age destroying all animal life therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them the characters have no logic batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward robin bruce wayne is trying to be father figure constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships while at the same time not really having any george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him to say that his performance is workman like is to be generous his best performances are still on bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend played by elle macpherson that it brings into question bruce latent homosexuality there is no spark and no passion as there was for nicole kidman psychologist in batman forever between bruce and anyone other than alfred and even that relationship is very reserved robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series now he just spoiled kid in batman forever burt ward wanted to be batman partner and friend now robin is suffering from ego deficiency robin attraction for poison ivy is not believable except for boy around the age of 15 his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest even though they are not related in traditional sense chris donnell once considered rising star successfully burns up on reentry with this performance his robin needs nothing more than good spanking the less said about alicia silverstone performance the better this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of dubbing actor for godzilla film she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it this brings us to the villains arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday the most rediculous scene is during mr freeze imprisonment the guards are at least foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film it almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as gang member umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part showing growing discomfort with her sex symbol status her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in sextette 1978 the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film without going through the intricacies of the plot there is one question that always comes to mind with this series except for the first batman and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel mr freeze is introduced with team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video every villain even the minor ones have to have look no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume with this film warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to it tv incarnation the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows gwaaaa and clang associated with the old series you almost wonder if william dozier producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film the special effects by john dykstra and production design by barbara ling are the primary stars of this film and it is case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing every set from ivy lair the batcave to freeze hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film everything is set for maximum exposure the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on the time machine the growing plant scene but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series master shots pepper the action scenes destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had mr schumacher is good director one just has to look back on the films the lost boys cousins an underrated film and the client to know that but batman and robin comes off as mated made for tv movie the film has no style of individuality it is the cinematic equivalent to jell pretty to look at but empty it is unfortunate that this film even with it surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warner thought tim burton would do with the franchise kill it joel schumacher batman robin is loud colorful action packed and ultimately boring stars
long ago films were constructed of strong dialogue original characters memorable plot points and solid acting one of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is this opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic and mean tragic life of novalee nation natalie portman hitting the road with her hick guitar playing boyfriend in rusted out gm novalee dreams of the mavi skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath plastic umbrella with her unborn baby due in month stopping off at nearby wal mart for quick rest novalee boyfriend decides to take off and leaves her there novalee then decides to secretly hole up in the wal mart because she not the brightest bulb in the stagelights wacky librarian keith david comes to her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store then the she moves in with family befriends everyone in town including ashley judd character who has five kids and still can work part time as nurse fights off religious freaks survives tornado breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her receives an inheritance builds martha stewart esque house becomes an award winning photographer and manages to always look like she stepped out of cosmo shoot all while not once doing anything with her kid this film is terrible the directing is awful it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every one of them over and over and over again we get pathetic and ugly acting by natalie portman who can do good work disjointed pacing of key scenes and time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the wal mart parking lot an embarrassing display of emotions by the characters making the audience ill taking two great comedic screenwriters babaloo mandel and lowell ganz and forcing them to write drama on par with oprah book club altogether it has the feeling of being trapped at home watching very bad television mini series and wishing it to end only the remote is broken however the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up where is the heart no one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk
stars armand assante mike hammer barbara carrera dr charlotte bennett laurene landon velda alan king charles kalecki geoffrey lewis joe butler paul sorvino detective pat chambers judson scott charles hendricks barry snider romero julia barr norma childs mpaa rating review in the 1982 updating of mickey spillane 1947 novel the jury hard boiled detective mike hammer is vietnam vet who drives shiny bronze trans am dresses like don johnson in miami vice with less pastels and has sworn off alcohol however he still smokes his lucky strikes detests all forms of authority and kills at whim beyond that the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page turner by spillane probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers the movie starts off with bang howler of an opening credits sequence that is cheap steal from the james bond series complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti rocky after that the movie and the book begin the same with the murder of jack williams frederick downs one armed detective and hammer best friend hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack death and with the help of his devoted secretary the blond and shapely velda laurene landon and the alternately friendly antagonistic police chief pat chambers paul sorvino he is immediately on the killer trail here the movie splits completely from the book and dives into convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia the cia one of hammer vietnam vet buddies and kinky sex clinic many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie but they take on slightly different roles for instance charles kalecki alan king numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book turns into suave mob boss and more importantly hammer suspicious love interest charlotte bennett barbara carrera morphs from run of the mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic the jury is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane books including 1953 version which was made in but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood production code although this takes the 1982 version of the jury closer to the core of the original subject matter it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book rest assured the movie not only includes great deal of nudity but it is thoroughly violent especially toward women it features one woman having her neck slashed set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia judson scott and another woman shot point blank in the belly by hammer himself no one would deny that spillane writing has definite misogynistic nature but the movie seems to take it step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment its constant equation of sex and violence much of which is played with the intention of being erotic is quite unsettling it no surprise that the movie like the book fades to siyah with dead woman on the floor the jury had troubled production and was not well supported by the studio that made it which is one explanation why it didn do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made the script was written by larry cohen who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies like it alive 1974 and its two sequels 1981 and the stuff 1985 cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well but he was yanked from the director chair after only week worth of shooting because he was already $100 000 over budget he was quickly replaced by richard heffron who has worked for the last three decades on handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently it shows in the final product cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer but heffron has none he shot the movie quickly and clumsily and although some scenes ring true most of them are flat trite and invariably dull the movie features numerous car chases shoot outs and stunts but heffron background in television is the dominant tone despite the graphic violence and full frontal nudity the jury takes on the air of made for tv quickie with no real punch or depth but the problems in the jury run deeper than the technical the central fault in this updating is mike hammer whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person hammer character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona we never really get that impression in the movie there is no first person voice over narration and some scenes don have hammer in them at all consequently great deal of the texture of spillane storytelling is lost the period updating turns out to be detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer moral code is thrown to the wind despite his characterization as hard nosed violent misogynistic killer hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code the title itself the jury refers to his anti establishment notion of being his own law unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment in this way he can be seen as above the law but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct his own morality the movie forgoes that aspect of his character and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society terms but in any terms especially his own if anything hammer always had his professionalism but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful maybe the scene was intended for laughs but it only cheapens hammer character and is by all accounts lousy way to start the movie the blame for hammer character can be laid on assante shoulders because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon like mumbling he delivers fine performance spillane never once described hammer physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared so any actor could conceivably portray him of course because of the lack of written description those who have read spillane books will have strong personal notion of what hammer looks like and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations spillane who played the character himself in 1963 the girl hunters is generally considered the best of the film hammers the rest of actors are most un noteworthy with the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino everyone who appeared in the jury were up and comers who basically went nowhere many of them ended up working in television like carrera who had short stint on dallas in the mid eighties which only adds to the made for tv atmosphere of the film maybe someday someone will manage to get the right elements together and make an effective film rendition of spillane book but this is certainly not it
nostalgia for the 70s continues as we see revival of one of the decade greatest achievements the marijuana comedy however half baked doesn quite run with all its brain cells and will make you appreciate the questionable talents of cheech and chong all the more the plot follows the misadventures of four ne er do well stoners there the group unofficial leader thurgood david chappelle scarface guillermo diaz brian jim breuer and kenny harland williams kenny gets into trouble when while on munchie run feeds his snack foods to diabetic police horse when the animal keels over he finds himself accused of killing police officer and facing $1 000 000 bail his friends promise to raise money for 10% bail bond but have no idea how that is until thurgood stumbles upon stash of pharmaceutical marijuana being tested at the company where he works as janitor soon the three guys are dealing dope to raise funds while avoiding the cops and rival dealer sampson simpson clarence williams iii for comedy the film is pretty humorless not that it doesn try it just that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat the four leads are nearly all playing the same character only williams stands out while still performing on the level of his humor free comedy rocket man but that is because he imprisoned throughout most of the film giving much needed change of pace but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another to help out the film is packed full of cameos steven wright tommy chong janeane garofalo willie nelson snoop doggy dogg and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another none of them work beyond the simple hey that _____ level in fact the funniest work in the film comes from chappelle not as his bland pothead lead but in his second role as pot obsessed rapper sir smokealot granted it pretty much one joke role and there aren ton of laughs but this film needs every one it can scrape up to top it off and in move contrasting with the tone of the rest of the film thurgood is given love interest mary jane rachel true her role is that of the public service announcement to inform us why doing drugs including pot is wrong her character seems fabricated merely as defense to the your film promotes the use of drugs camp the film would have been better off by sticking with the rebel tone it so eagerly tries to claim yet in the end it doesn really matter watching the film clean and sober you are bound to recognize how truly awful it is

robin hood men in tights is another mel brooks produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit unfortunately robin hood men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles none of the fun acting of young frankenstein is devoid of the charm of spaceballs and is even lacking the good solid dialogue of history of the world it is in short one of the worst movies have seen mel brooks or anybody else produce the plot borrows heavily from the well received kevin costner movie of last year robin hood prince of thieves this is not surprising in and of itself and could have been used to great comic effect mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie mel brooks does not take advantage of this however and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air none of which connect and none of which are explained later on the movie scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice cary elwes of princess bride fame plays robin of loxley man who was captured in the crusades fighting with king richard he escapes and joining with man named achoo am sure you can see the obvious joke fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard which has been captured by evil prince john played by funny comic richard lewis he also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil sheriff of rottingham good adventure plot that is sadly unused elwes and lewis are both excellent comics but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating neither actor has any good words to work with and the lines simply aren funny nor believable perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter man playing macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone this particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas that really felt like leaving the theatre much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout and some left the theatre chuckles were few and far between and they mostly dealt with visual jokes such as an old beaten up horse from rent wreck then from any dialogue whatsoever scenes that could have been classics such as the archery contest are ruined by poor acting perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive the basic plot that robin has received key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian is not witty nor funny mel brooks as circumcision giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience not all jewish either the movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails the addition of blind man who stumbles around falling off cliffs walking into ledges and being general buffoon could have had some humorous potential but is also made terribly offensive the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard he is well worth waiting for if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue excruciating visual humor old puns ancient jokes and bad acting if you can don even bother watching this miserable film
director luis mandoki last film was the superb serious 1994 drama when man loves woman but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture message in bottle which is the worst type of romance movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before and much better so there an absence of suspense and the film ultimately moves at such very very deliberate pace as if it is trying to make great meaningful statements and plot developments that it just becomes tedious bore to sit through message in bottle begins with theresa osborne robin wright penn single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune whom finds bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to mystery woman named catherine and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and to her objection finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper soon heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and ship logo on the top of the typed message and after it is traced to man named garrett blake theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks boating town in north carolina to find out the specifics of the message of course garrett turns out to be handsome rugged man around theresa age and played by kevin costner she is immediately charmed by him but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there and finds that catherine was garrett late wife who died few years earlier do you think you know where this is headed most likely you do and wouldn call it giving away anything to say that by the picture end the movie has fallen into deep artificial melodrama that didn buy for second if there are any positive things to say about message in bottle it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman as garrett stubborn but loving father are far above par to be in such wasteful shaggy dog love story and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast and paints chicago as an equally alluring city meanwhile costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less than stellar films that he has made recently it seems that with such bad luck he wouldn want to make another movie set near water but here he is again with one of the main and most ridiculous centerpieces set on storm swept sea the other actors are all sadly wasted including illeana douglas an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the friend roles here playing penn confidante and co worker at the tribune the first half of message in bottle plays like hum drum trite television movie for the lifetime channel as theresa spends great deal of time getting to know garrett with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining usually am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships but here it all rang with resounding falseness since the dialogue felt written and not as if people were really talking when the main characters of film have very little of interest to say to each other and are not particularly interesting themselves you know immediately that you are in trouble swear that while watching message in bottle felt as if had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater heck in actuality not even familiar to the novel this is based on by nicholas sparks always one step ahead of the characters the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried and true hollywood melodrama the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa secret and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after this same exact problem occurred in last year very very similar watch this and you will realize just how similar mean meg ryan nicolas cage romantic drama city of angels although theresa is deeply touched by the heartfelt letter that she finds in the bottle perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding message in bottle of their own preferably before filming began it should have read memo to screenwriters use you brain
remember really enjoying this movie when saw it years ago guess my memory really sucks there is very very little that is funny in caddyshack the laughs are few and far between and what there are really aren that great caddyshack as the name implies more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club michael keefe plays said caddy why they cast this unknown fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me the movie doesn seem to have real plot just series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera the only real story if you can call it that was subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper bill murray who is having his own private little war against gopher who is ruining the course most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera with painfully limited success bill murray is slightly amusing in places but fairly wasted the biggest waste of all is chevy chase who didn even crack smile on my face with his character lame zen like approach to golfing there are few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie guess that what you get for basing story around an unknown kid not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of but really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper nothing about this movie works it wouldn have taken genius to figure out that this thing wasn going to fly most of the scenes just couldn possibly be funny it as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny in reality they were painfully embarrassing to watch there is scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the hot babe of the movie walking by in her bikini olive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl everything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned maybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny but for the rest of us stay the hell away from caddyshack
tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse the fugitive not quite this is the plot for double jeopardy another fugitive copycat without the action excitement and good acting that the original had there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good this time tommy lee jones plays parole officer not us marshall clever huh oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband bruce greenwood who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not one armed man both movies are on video make the wise choice and pick the fugitive there are so many flaws in double jeopardy it is laughable while serving time in prison libby parsons judd discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice learning that her husband is still alive she decides to serve her time in prison find him retrieve her son and kill her husband if necessary when the strict parole officer travis lehman jones stands in her way libby decides to break the rules who knows why and continue her plan despite the fact that if she gets caught she going back to jail director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son every other scene we are given shot of libby staring and crying at his picture in an action movie like this valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something all that is needed in this type of movie is short scene in which libby tells herself or friend miss my son nothing more nothing less dr kimble of the fugitive didn look at one picture of his dead wife his primary concern was to save himself libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this they will be typecast for the rest of their careers kind of like their doomed co star tommy lee jones winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his do my job whether they are innocent or guilty roles people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so guess he was right though don think he will win another oscar again the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count burglary assault grand theft auto are some of libby slipups the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you re innocent of the major crime hopefully criminals won use double jeopardy as reference in court for why they are innocent that would just be plain stupid
while am not fond of any writer use of cheap easy puns am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it witness my review of _pecker_ from couple of issues ago so here goes the juvenile college set siyah comedy _dead_man_on_campus_ is dead on arrival strait laced med student josh tom everett scott who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout blemish free academic record breaks out into fs thanks to the influence of his ever partying roommate cooper mark paul gosselaar who introduces josh to the sex and booze filled nights that come with university life with the threat of losing an academic scholarship josh and life cleaning toilets for his dad looming cooper what are two good hearted slackers to do easy look for loophole which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if student or students roommate commits suicide the surviving student shall receive straight as so instead of studying josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there move him into their dorm room and drive him to suicide before the semester ends director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike beyaz working from story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper diabolical plot until then the usual boring cliches of college life booze sex more booze fill the time which is made to feel longer by _saved_by_the_bell_ alumnus gosselaar sitcom bred mugging that said once cohn and company do build some comic momentum they mishandle it the introduction of the manic psychotic cliff lochlyn munro potential roommate for josh and cooper brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates paranoid nerd buckley randy pearlstein and british death rocker matt corey page one wishes that cliff would reappear but as they say be careful what you wish for not surprisingly he does resurface and it then becomes clear that this is character that is best taken in small dose almost immediately his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty the same can be said about all of _dead_man_on_campus_ whatever morbid appeal the far fetched premise has quickly evaporates and the self absorbed characters especially cooper pretty much grate from the get go _dead_man_ doesn grow tiresome it already _is_ once the clever opening titles are through as it slogs along to cheesy happy for all parties conclusion _dead_man_ lives up to its title and then some not only does the movie grow even more tired and die it still insists on going on like zombie
boy what great movie keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together the director of the fugitive andrew davis back again to give us another thriller and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot how could this not be blockbuster all die hard keanu reeves fans read on ol much ado about nothing plays eddie kasalivich machinist studying at the university of chicago to help pay for the rent he takes on this job making the machinery for hydrogen project being conducted by the university by happy coincidence he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics this project holds great promise taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in potential solution to the earth energy problems without the pollution cost surely nobody could have any problems with that morgan freeman is paul shannon the project sponsor he works for very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly so he murders the project leader blows up the project great but short scene here sort of like mini id4 city devastation thing and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hi tech hush hush location unfortunately our intrepid machinist and an english physicist weisz manage to get away and now follows fugitive like chase using not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script this movie is just dying for comparison with the fugitive both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesn change much guess we can really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward credit to them but we aren really given much of chance to empathise with the characters where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves character is never given the time to develop it might have been better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences which frankly get quite boring after while harrison ford was the man against the world he was alone in world where he didn know who to trust and it came across real well in chain reaction keanu reeves isn alone now that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia vulnerability and confusion we don get this we get him thinking he still in speed only now our sandra bullock has an english accent probably doesn drive bus and hardly contributes anything to the movie the producers here probably thought hey what if keanu and rachel don hit it off too well let rope in that morgan to help us out well keanu and rachel didn hit it off well on the screen and most unfortunately morgan freeman doesn help much either the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has full load of cigars in his cigar holder it not really his fault once again andrew davis just doesn take the time to build his characters someone must have convinced him that this time round cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like headless chicken the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling hapless straight man from the hysterical naked gun films crack an immediate smile and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he committed himself to starring in since the wavering movie spoofs however are less forgivable to be fair wrongfully accused the send up in question and nielsen third parody since the last gun isn quite as excruciatingly humorless as his dracula dead and loving it or spy hard which is mighty good thing nielsen is still in tip top comedic form able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns but he really needs screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them and he needs one very soon wrongfully accused meshes together the premises of the fugitive and patriot games casting its always game star as ryan harrison get it master violinist who is drawn into an affair with married temptress kelly le brock she however sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband michael york crime actually committed by one armed one legged one eyed man aaron pearl harrison is arrested found guilty and sentenced to death but escapes from prison bus of course and then is pursued by determined marshal named fergus falls richard crenna unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones already smirky oscar winning role there also mystery brunette melinda mcgraw and an assassination subplot involving the secretary general but like any of it matters wrongfully accused gets off to an assured start with an in concert nielsen touted lord of the violin by bare chested posters pulling jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo clad mosh in front of the stage nice touch most of the scenes that follow however never top the opener hysterical exceptions the mentos and baywatch goofs movie parodies are crammed in at an almost subliminal rate but most are empty when giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches cast member la anaconda or baseball players disappear into field of dreams esque cornfield there really nothing to laugh at other moments like an interlude in fishing shop are so unfocused that you re not sure what you re supposed to be laughing at there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send ups here so it possible that director writer pat proft by bombarding the viewer with careless mixture of the two guarantees something is sure to stick and what does stick sticks well particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks and hard boiled dialogue what those naked gun which proft collaborated on did great these bits are so on target that they allow you to remember wrongfully accused as an almost halfway there spoof instead of lame brained failure the movie might have been cursed to begin with opening fast on the heels of mafia from proft colleague jim abrahams and baseketball from proft colleague david zucker but it strong possibility that nobody is going to be accusing wrongfully accused of being nielsen funniest
please don mind this windbag letting off bit of steam just want to warn all of all not to waste your hard earned $$$ on anaconda it not even worth 99 cent video rental don listen to ebert on this one he has no clue what he talking about btw accompanied my friend to this one because she was required to watch it on assignment she reviews movies for local paper now ll actually back up my huffing and puffing here goes movie anaconda rydain bottom line wait for it to come on usa up all night even then doubt it worth the price of jolt to help you stay up that late why do hate anaconda let me count the ways first of all this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong as an ophiophile snake lover can tell you that anacondas would never reach length of 40 feet they re scared of people cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in snake mouth and constrictor snakes don kill what they can eat people can outrun snakes with no trouble especially heavy ones like anacondas if an anaconda did eat human it would need at least months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal therefore it couldn run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast and snakes have no vocal cords so they can make funny squealing noises whew was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it unfortunately anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel my friend and even successfully predicted who would live at the end anybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually that was pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and didn give up and fall asleep he was the most likable character in the movie who wouldn enjoy somebody who looks like deranged walt whitman anaconda did have its cute moments arguments between ice cube character and the british guy for instance however those small flashes of wit were not worth the other hour and twenty eight minutes of boring schlock the writers had and blew multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines was quite disappointed with scene where young guy tells young lady that the jungle makes him horny did she retort with clever ego withering comeback of course not trying to work gee that even dumber than the crap comebacks come up with she could have told him to go find knothole or something but will admit there was just one scene where was surprised at the outcome hint it involves the evil guy and miss crap comebacks as for the plot still trying to find one this movie was basically an excuse to get boatload of people into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous computer generated anacondas with the eyes and fangs of vipers and the faster than gravity downward acceleration of harrier jet harrier snake not to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims the writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist should call it plot knot because it made no sense in which the sick guy friend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him that was about as clear and understandable as mission impossible if someone could explain that movie to me be most grateful all the old guy double agents looked the same wasn inspired by the acting save for the evil dude can blame the actors though it not their fault they had cruddy script to work with this concludes rydain diatribe on shameless exploitation and perpetuation of public fear of snakes comments flames anyone rydain the atomic cheese fresh from chernobyl dairies
this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be one of the hottest writers in hollywood he wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream 10 then added the successful know what you did last summer 10 script to his mix and also created the popular tv series dawson creek so when he asked to direct his first movie based on his first ever script written everyone and their grandma said sure go for it uhhm my question is did anyone bother reading this stupid script plot ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west mrs tingle and set to lose her scholarship to college when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story they end up tying her up and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman critique it not so much that this is bad movie than the fact that it sucks this movie is chock full of one dimensional characters contains no actual humor that was able to zone in on zero tension or thrills plot holes the size of my big ass lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie and molly ringwald vivica fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery 10 and to but unfortunately for williamson he went nowhere with the bright foundation making references to the exorcist and dr zhivago which doubt many in his target market will appreciate he also forgot about suspense with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue sure katie holmes is cute and her co star marisa coughlan did reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist worth two points out of my three on ten but how can we forgive the biggest one dimensional character in any film holmes rival in the film mrs tingle complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays and transparent romance between holmes and some long haired dude hired to be the poor man version of skeet ulrich who himself is poor man version of johnny depp all in all this movie was laughable for me provided me with no insight into anything demonstrated williamson genuine lack of directorial skills alongside juvenile script and provided helen mirren with great role to chew into unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability humanity or capacity to comprehend no hip lines no cheap thrills just dull time at the movie theater if you want to see funny teenage movie go see detroit rock city 10 and thank my drunken sorry ass in the morning little known facts about this film and its stars kevin williamson father was fisherman kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in know what you did last summer 10 he is also huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally so is dawson leery on tv dawson creek show kevin created he was once an aspiring actor in fact he even landed bit part on tv another world also williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs tingle which is also loosely based on the book killing mr griffin by the writer of know what you did last summer 10 lois duncan he has also come out and said that he is gay man helen mirren was born in london england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff she is married to director taylor hackford whose works include devil advocate 10 and an officer and gentleman 10 this film was originally titled killing mrs tingle but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident actress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called wasteland this is actor barry watson first full feature film he has played the character of seth on tv malibu shores several times
in typical cinematic high school the football jocks have sex with the girls and then dump them but not before the boys scores are dutifully recorded in their little siyah books as the sexual acts take place the other guys hang out nearby guzzling beer and grunting like pigs in the rage carrie robert mandel terminally bland sequel to carrie there isn single original moment only amy irving returns from carrie and the talent of the rest of the sequel cast is impossible to determine given the stupefying mediocrity of rafael moreu script as rachel the horror story lead emily bergl gives one of the least scary performances in recent memory but it isn exactly her fault the director asks for little from his actors which is precisely what he gets sporadically in this lame and lifeless movie rachel will cause school lockers and windows to fly open but generally she just mopes around looking like victim her fellow students delight in tormenting her of course she will get her revenge in the obligatory ending bloodbath in which she will decapitate and castrate the boys and crush the girls with burning timbers as the movie marks time until its big finale it throws in some repugnant scenes hoping to turn audience stomachs rachel girlfriend commits horrible and realistic suicide after the boy who made love to her the night before spurns her he gets major points in his siyah book for this but his buddies say he would have gotten more if he had had sex with her after her death even helpless puppy is run over and we see his poor little body flipping over and over under truck the teenagers in the movie are completely blas about it all doesn it offend you that some girl offed herself yesterday asks one of the few kids with conscience why responds his nonplussed girlfriend she wasn anybody remarkably devoid of any energy especially for horror flick the movie makes one yearn for fast forward button on the theater armrest with material this bad the film only hope is to go for parody but it isn smart enough to realize it even the mandatory epilogue is as pointless and predictable as the rest of the movie the rage carrie runs 45 it is rated for graphic violence teen alcohol abuse sex nudity and profanity and would be acceptable only for older teenagers
man this was one wierd movie similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn decide which genre it is the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship the last half hour this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided screw it let just kill everybody from then on forget sci fi this movie becomes 100% horror what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to scare this movie just uses loud noises sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore yawn everyone seen it all before and knows when to expect it the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed but what did this then finally after being painfully restored the new crew views the video the acting isn too bad at all considering what the actors had to work with anyway as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space this movie could have been so much better it had good experienced cast who deserved more to work with there was just nothing new here that any of us haven seen before in aliens or hellraiser
the king and warner brothers animated musical feature recycles the classic story of woman who challenges the heart of king with obvious results when anna miranda richardson british schoolteacher travels to saim to educate the king martin vidnovic children she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly and must say something to the greedy ruler meanwhile the king prime minister ian richardson the stereotypical villain plots to overthrow the king taking the throne the last and most predictable main subplot deals with the king son allen hong and his love for servant tuptim armi arabe and how he conflicts with his feelings and the ancient laws of saim not even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent as the king and problems could fill the blank pages of journal will only note the major difficulties for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail the screenplay written by arthur rankin peter bakalian jacqeline feather and david seidler which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein has some of the worst dialogue written in film within recent memory as every time the obnoxious king would shout etc etc etc would cringe literally speaking of cringing did quite bit of this during the rather short film which is classic display of terrible filmmaking besides the repetitive dialogue from the king on the whole the songs seem out of place and unlike the lyrics are unmagical the sole song which is used cleverly is getting to know you which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors which they have never been exposed to unlike disney animated features the king and songs don add to the film and are as uneffective as could be take the following scenario as an example as the sheer horror of the king and music is at its worst you re being hunted by dragon what do you do sing happy song martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion you hear the saying two negatives don make positive believe it with the terrible dialogue that the king has along with his awful voice track the king is completely unbelievable only shows mild signs of any personality and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says etc etc etc more and more as the film progresses no personality at the beginning of the movie none at the end and where does this character personality change hey thought anna was supposed to change him isn that the whole plot the prime minister hideous sidekick darrell hammond brings his share of cringes as well oh no another one of his teeth fell out hardy har har he is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets but even at age five would have cringed while watching him by the way this review is going you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films hence why hate this movie because the king and is disgrace to animation animated films such as 1994 the lion king and 1998 the prince of egypt are among my favorite movies of all time the animation team does design their share of well animated settings so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king until realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds have not read the play or seen the oscar winning 1956 film adaption but from what can tell the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play for the king and is never magical nor interesting if it wasn for miranda richardson who voices anna with feeling the king and could earn the title worst movie of the decade instead the king and will just go down as among the year worst the bottom line avoid this movie at all costs not even young children the target audience in this film will enjoy it not the slightest bit
synopsis cro magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by lion reluctantly rescued by neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy style ayla grows up to become blond feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without mate comments allow me to state for the record that find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci fi classic blade runner the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as selling point the poster art bears striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title not even her starring role in this turkey unfortunately can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese it so uniquely bad film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries and miserably fails to be serious that it oddly fascinating the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed wanting to see how this dud plays out the clan of the cave bear is based upon popular novel by jean auel to this day the book possesses loyal cult following remember dear friend of mine had dog eared copy of the novel she had read as child with all the so called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother have never read this book but sure hope it 10 000 times better than its film adaptation if not then at complete loss to explain its popularity the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with comically absurd scene young ayla looking much like drew barrymore in tramps about in the woods with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her the audience expectations of convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered what follows is laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla mother blonde with fur pants er leggings tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera well as the earthquake slowly recedes hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch but the screaming six year old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find safe haven won detail the story any further this seems enough to illustrate my point this movie is really stupid it never even gives the audience chance to suspend their disbelief also the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning wonderbra in front of charlton heston the movie doesn just suggest this message it whacks the message into the audience with two by four blond gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs she of the new people they re of the old people with the memories yep we get it we get it the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make up which surprises me the movie depends upon lot of make up obviously but much of it is unconvincing as stated before daryl hannah is daryl hannah here she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time the rest of the characters have dark make up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt the face painting that occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind this movie also suffers from its new age trappings maybe the music sounded lot more fresh or original during 1985 but now it sounds dated and cliched like poorly conceived elevator music add to this the film faux mysticism including spirit animals and dream visions and narrator who sounds like psychic you expect to hear on 900 number and you get movie that has serious problems being serious the clan of the cave bear is rated though it probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films ve seen in quite while it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes the funniest moment of the movie occurs when neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from ferocious bear the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about although this may sound gratuitous sure it so cheesy that it probably won bother most people the clan of the cave bear is bad movie however as wrote at the beginning of this review it does have the distinction of originality typically when think of bottom of the barrel films dealing with early man fantasy movies involving dinosaurs who did not exist at the same time as man and raquel welch come to mind the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that though it so bad the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie which is why awarded this turkey two stars have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version however only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie shudder to think that it could be otherwise
salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets actors who demand such salaries might be greedy but in some instances they are quite justified because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation proof for that can be found even in the realm of low budget movies and one fine example is breakaway 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring in famous figure skater tonya harding face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie poster but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra attractive woman who works as courier for gangster one day she decides to retire but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that realising that her life suddenly became worthless myra starts running for her life followed by professional assassins terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities her acting leaves much to be desired on the other hand her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave films bad name martin sheen brother joe estevez whose character looks like he had entered from another movies set is the only bright spot of breakaway unfortunately he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding silver screen debut proved to be her last film
movies like six days seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford anne heche and ivan reitman put lot of hard work in to script worth about ten cents the script was written by michael browning and he decided that instead of thinking up new ideas he rehash lot of cliches omit even the slightest bit of character development and then throw in drug dealing pirates to provide for few high level action sequences and explosions there are good scripts out there that high profile actors can make see the truman show for instance six days seven nights is simply waste let see we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island so how do we do that well we ll make her feisty magazine editor and we ll make him crusty old pilot but wait she has to have fianc that can be david schwimmer but wait if she has fianc how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone know they ll get to their vacation spot and then she ll get called back yessssss so they ll crash on the island and that will be funny for about five minutes shucks oh ve got it we ll throw in distracting subplot in which her fianc has sex with really attractive woman who acts like bimbo and then he can feel guilty then when anne heche kisses harrison ford they have to kiss because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie it will be vindicated action because her fianc will already have cheated on her then for no obvious reason they ll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them oh yes feel so good about this story instead of using characterization to propel the events it will be completely random and yet totally predictable imagine that don get me wrong six days seven nights is not boring picture ford and heche both do great job the sparks fly between them and so most of browning inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors sheer force of talent almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen and found myself laughing pretty hard schwimmer is also funny and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get and reitman who has made some good films at least tries to make things exciting even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences it just when start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces the picture feels like it been hacked to pieces wouldn be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely the ones that are here are as bad as they come think let out very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships and just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream why did you pick this awful script the film is outright stupid but some of the elements are subtly horrifying for instance take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo and then feels really guilty this is serious problem in real life but six days seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to weak plot device his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford in script that lacks even glimpse of intelligent subtlety find it odd that such strangely insulting device ended up in the story this is summer movie season but that doesn mean our movies have to be dumb 1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters when was in line for six days seven nights heard the woman in front of me ask for two tickets to that new harrison ford movie why didn she know the name of the film suppose she just didn care what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big budget pictures don realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves good actors should sign to good scripts and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash they least they could do is assume that we like to spend our money on story worth more than ten cents
if anything stigmata should be taken as warning against releasing similarly themed films relatively close to one another of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year it is clearly the worst suppose should have seen this coming after all blair witch thoroughly creeped me out sixth sense was mildly spooky and then stir of echoes had its moments but wasn anything lose sleep over clearly the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping is it then any surprise that stigmata is the dullest most horribly executed piece of mtv influenced tripe have seen in long while no not really patricia arquette plays frankie page hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives rosary as gift from her globe trotting mother as it turns out the rosary belonged to recently deceased brazilian priest the priest church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne because of the mysterious appearance of bleeding statue father kiernan is an investigator who has made career out of disproving supposed religious signs but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue his investigation is soon called off however when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata in which person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie story considering she an atheist but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on he eventually begins to suspect that his boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church as it turns out the dead priest had been working on the translation of fifth gospel before they were excommunicated the new rupert wainwright music video mean film stigmata is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse indeed it would have been good if it were music video because it only interesting for about five minutes not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow motion double exposure and extreme close ups whoaaaaaa other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and yes he has been to film school his camera trickery is interesting for little while but eventually it becomes headache inducing what this film needed is second audio track to be played over the dialogue such as it is with wainwright screaming at the audience see look at what can do an ex cellent dir ect or maybe then he explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow motion shots of water dripping in reverse or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ooh scary if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery didn see it just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story here comes double exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever arrrrrrrghhhh then again the superfluous camera trickery wouldn bother me if stigmata had story or characters that were remotely engaging though wainwright vanity certainly doesn help he does seem to have been given nearly unworkable script where are plot continuity and character development when you need them case in point frankie page is the character that assume we are supposed to identify and sympathize with but we aren given any back story on her character or any reason to like her the extent of her character development seems to be that she is hard working hairdresser who can somehow afford cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building and she kind of cute so let start the bleeding the fact that she clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn help either according to frankie page what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back go clubbing sure that makes sense arquette byrne and pryce give it the old college try but their characters are so one dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable even though frankie page life is falling apart before her very eyes she still finds the time to hit on priest who wanders in to her hair salon even more curiously he seems to be interested in her advances father andrew religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic as for pryce he may as well wear curled mustache and cackle ll get you my pretty for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded trust me not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be villain what worse after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats we now have to contend with story that starts off in one direction veers off in another then another and ends up being totally incomprehensible first of all the film doesn even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching rosary how come an atheist like her was chosen since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata actually not sure what frankie was posessed by supposedly stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest and later by some evil spirit think which one is it the answer to this question of course is very simple the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr wainwright wants to use this time furthermore the ending is ridiculously neat little wrap up and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into diatribe against the catholic church if you do any research at all about the gospel of st thomas you ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church as the film seems to claim but that it is readily available at your local library there nothing the catholics need to worry about though stigmata religion is so off base that it can be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters they should have gone all out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns which would have been far more interesting not catholic in fact don care much for the catholic church but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means it rare to see film that fails on as many levels as stigmata does it not thought provoking though it would like to be and it is definitely not scary though it pretends to be not sure why they tried to pass this off as horror film because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story maybe it an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over and over and over like so many films of the mtv generation this one suffers from overkill so much is overdone in stigmata that it eventually has no effect on the audience leaving us to pick out the film many flaws also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st thomas is so earth shattering when we finally hear it the saying sounds like something every five year old learns on their first day of sunday school which means that for all its flash the whole film is really much ado about nothing the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog and stigmata is it
john boorman zardoz is goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on bizarre enjoyment quality all its own not since the rampant bumblings of one edward wood jr has movie been so silly and so serious at the same time of course wood career can be explained by two things he had no money and he had no talent boorman on the other hand cannot court such excuses to explain zardoz or his follow up film the equally awful exorcist ii the heretic boorman obviously had sizable budget matinee idol movie star sean connery in the lead role and although you wouldn know it from this film boorman does indeed have talent this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece deliverance 1972 as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama hope and glory 1987 the slightly over conceived arthurian epic excalibur 1981 and the father son jungle adventure the emerald forest 1985 his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste if boorman is anything he ambitious and when he succeeds it in grand fashion unfortunately the bigger they are the harder they fall and when boorman falls the resounding impact can be heard for miles around zardoz is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies an obsession of boorman his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even the wizard of oz book which figures into the movie plot but despite all this reaching the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling the events take place in the distant year 2293 but there is little of the typical futuristic movie ness to be found in fact things seems to have moved backwards with people riding horses shooting old style guns and living in large victorian mansions it more middle ages than space age the world of zardoz is divided into two distinct hemispheres the outlands where all the poor pathetic people live and the vortex where select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life these immortals never grow old they never engage in sexual activity they possess psychological powers and they live in sort of quasi utopian marxist society where everyone is equal and everyone contributes equally to the society however if one breaks the rules that person is punished by being aged so many years if someone breaks the rules enough he or she is aged to the point of senility and imprisoned to an eternal existence in geriatric home with others aged criminals one of the immortals arthur frayn niall buggy squirmy man with mustache and goatee tattooed on his face is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed like the wizard of oz he adopts god like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in giant stone carved like menacing head this flying head is one of the movie opening images and it dead giveaway of the lunacy to come calling himself zardoz frayn gathers bunch of outlanders and makes them into group called the exterminators whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can procreate and take up more resources from inside his giant stone head zardoz bellows seriously laugh inducting statements like the gun is good the penis is evil that line alone is worth the movie cult following one day an exterminator named zed sean connery sneaks into zardoz flying stone pushes frayn out and goes back to the vortex once there the immortals label him brutal and study him like lab rat taking great perverse care in exploring his sexuality which is mystery to them they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection and there is one downright hilarious sequence where bunch of scantily clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up say hilarious because that is exactly what zardoz is it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so he made this film with the straightest of faces although have hard time believing that as production moved forward he didn get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles he spends most of the film running around in kirmizi loin cloth that resembles diaper mane of hair braided halfway down his back wyatt earp style handlebar mustache and pair of thigh high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on cheap hollywood hooker boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of deliverance which is the only reason can imagine studio would green light this effort he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth 2001 whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in zardoz besides the inadvertent humor sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 and perhaps he was looking for change in pace he got exactly that in zardoz and it wonder it didn end his career sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements is it treatise about the infallibility of eternal life is it condemnation of those who consider growing old to be bad thing or is it social statement something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary come to think of it maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip people high on illicit substances are the only ones can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than completely unintentional comedy
the kids in the hall are an acquired taste it took at least season of watching their show on hbo before became believer maybe after watching half dozen kids in the hall movies they would grow into the big screen my recommendation is that unless you are big fan of the kids skip the film as it is their first and most likely only attempt at full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv big budget and glossy production can not make up for lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show the kids go through the motions but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics brain candy is bunch of skits tied together by the story of pharmaceutical company that develops new drug to cure depression in typical sketch comedy tradition each actor plays several roles doctor cooper kevin mcdonald and his team create the drug then under pressure from don roritor mark mckinney founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals dr cooper releases the drug into the marketplace the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film at about 90 minutes brain candy still seems long the best thing about sketch comedy and the kids are no exception is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs then go on to another quick skit but with the additional set up necessary in telling longer coherent story the laughs just dont come fast enough strangely the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv the movie makes several attempts at risqueness mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters but they seem almost forced as if they have to live up to pg rating one of the best bits though does make use of thompsons naked buttocks we see him charging into battle going to have sex with some guys taking shower in the classic of this genre monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail the kids unfortunately are not up to the task there are some amusing moments to be sure but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one
there was time when john carpenter was great horror director of course his best film was 1978 masterpiece halloween but he also made 1980 the fog and 1987 underrated prince of darkness heck he even made good film in 1995 with in the mouth of madness but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 with the terrible comedy memoirs of an invisible man somehow carpenter has lost his touch with junk like his failed 1995 remake of village of the damned to his uninspired 1996 sequel escape from those movies however look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film john carpenter vampires if was him definately wouldn want to put my own name in the title it is sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as vampires the story is simple jack crow james woods is vampire hunter who along with one of his partners montoya daniel baldwin and prostitute katrina sheryl lee survives an attack from the master vampire valek thomas ian griffith since katrina was previously bitten by him crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires couple days later and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her it seems valek mission is to steal siyah wooden cross from roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him my question is how many time have we seen this same story played out well the answer is just about as many times as better version of the story has been made john carpenter vampires sadly enough is one of the most unscary horror films ve ever seen in fact there isn even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105 minute running time the non stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed without any interesting camera work which is usually trademark of carpenter and then we come to the screenplay which as far as can tell is nearly non existent there is no story development and there isn even an attempt to flesh out the characters james woods can be good actor but he has nothing to do here but to say couple of pseudo clever lines of dialogue daniel baldwin has some potential but his character comes off as being very dense and sheryl lee faring much better as laura palmer in twin peaks like all of the female characters plays an offensive stereotypical whore there is not an ounce of intelligence or excitement in john carpenter vamires which is very disheartening coming from an ex fan of carpenter he has said that he turned down directing halloween h20 because he couldn work up any excitement for it and yet when asked about vampires sequel he said he would be happy to do it think that definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent not to mention significant number of iq points
two party guys bob their heads to haddaway dance hit what is love while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub it barely enough to sustain three minute _saturday_night_live_ skit but _snl_ producer lorne michaels _clueless_ creator amy heckerling and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution recurring roxbury guys sketch that would presumably make good feature emphasis on the word presumably _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point and that of viewers patience levels the first five minutes or so of _roxbury_ play very much like one of the original roxbury guys skits with what is love blaring on the soundtrack the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi chris kattan and will ferrell bob their heads scope out hotties at clubs and then bump select few with violent pelvic thrusts there is one crucial difference however these guys speak that little fact has been used as justification for the film existence that the butabis newfound capacity for speech would open up whole new set of doors for the characters the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren ferrell and kattan are new that for sure but they all lead to comic dead ends there is no story per se only loosely structured and linked series of subplots the brothers literally run into or rather get run into as in by car richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ fame and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club there they meet hotshot club owner chazz palminteri conspicuously uncredited can you blame him who takes an interest in an idea of theirs meanwhile the bros overbearing father dan hedaya wants them to stop clubbing when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father rift is created between the two the narrative messiness of _roxbury_ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny but virtually none of it is the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film with the one big exception being big laugh near the end alas the joke rather lazy takeoff on _jerry_maguire_ will only strike chord with people who have seen that film granted lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ but the fact that the film best joke is completely dependent on one familiarity with another film says lot about _roxbury_ lack of inspiration that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_ the roxbury guys is one joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context after watching one of the roxbury skits on snl this is what you come away with from the characters they bob their heads to what is love bump unsuspecting women and that all after watching _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ you ll be left with exactly the same
