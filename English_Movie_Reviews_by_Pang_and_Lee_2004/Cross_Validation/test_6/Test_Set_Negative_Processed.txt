plot two teen couples go to church party drink and then drive they get into an accident one of the guys dies but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life and has nightmares what the deal watch the movie and sorta find out critique mind fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on very cool idea but presents it in very bad package which is what makes this review an even harder one to write since generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold mess with your head and such lost highway memento but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films and these folks just didn snag this one correctly they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept but executed it terribly so what are the problems with the movie well its main problem is that it simply too jumbled it starts off normal but then downshifts into this fantasy world in which you as an audience member have no idea what going on there are dreams there are characters coming back from the dead there are others who look like the dead there are strange apparitions there are disappearances there are looooot of chase scenes there are tons of weird things that happen and most of it is simply not explained now personally don mind trying to unravel film every now and then but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again get kind of fed up after while which is this film biggest problem it obviously got this big secret to hide but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes and do they make things entertaining thrilling or even engaging in the meantime not really the sad part is that the arrow and both dig on flicks like this so we actually figured most of it out by the half way point so all of the strangeness after that did start to make little bit of sense but it still didn the make the film all that more entertaining guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is into it even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding mean showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy okay we get it there are people chasing her and we don know who they are do we really need to see it over and over again how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie apparently the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves and it shows there might ve been pretty decent teen mind fuck movie in here somewhere but guess the suits decided that turning it into music video with little edge would make more sense the actors are pretty good for the most part although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty only in new neighborhood but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller who holds her own throughout the entire film and actually has you feeling her character unraveling overall the film doesn stick because it doesn entertain it confusing it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime despite pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it oh and by the way this is not horror or teen slasher flick it just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since whatever skip it where joblo coming from nightmare of elm street 10 blair witch 10 the crow 10 the crow salvation 10 lost highway 10 10 memento 10 10 the others 10 stir of echoes 10
plot young french boy sees his parents killed before his eyes by tim roth oops mean an evil man he vows revenge on that man and is taught the ways of the musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself anyway fourteen years go by and arrgh well you know the rest swish swish zzzzzzz critique this is pretty bad movie let see where should start okay first of all the story is just plain boring it not original is entirely predictable and lacks energy okay what next acting you say hmmmm well the main actor justin chambers is basically an uncharismatic version of chris donnell but with less range think about that and mena suvari is just plain off not as bad as thora birch was in dungeons dragons but entirely miscast with bad deliveries awful sequences and piss poor accent that comes and goes now not sure if this was ms suvari fault or the director but ve definitely seen her at much higher level than in this film the only semi saving grace actor wise is tim roth as the irrepressible bad guy but once again it not something that we haven seen before thousand times by the same guy tim please for the love of god beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day american roles for you as nice guy in romantic comedy or something stretch dude stretch we all know that you can do much better than this gunk alright what else was bad in this film oh yeah the score yikes how about taking it down few notches there fellas this thing blares in your ear whenever it feels the need to accentuate certain scene but actually does little more than annoy think it important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isn real epic by any stretch of the imagination it fluffy rehashed cake walk created by some shrewd studio heads who decided to take advantage of the whole kung fu phenomenon in films and test it out on an old classic dudes you failed all around keep reading the editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie the dialogue banal and stilted and the plot problems plentiful why does the guy on top of the horse carriage just stand there when his opponent takes forever scampering his way back to the top why don they just cut the mouseketeer rope at the top of the tower instead of jumping down on their own chords and fighting him while hanging why doesn anybody look day older when the sequence says 14 years later at least change your shirt man keep in mind that have never strayed away from championing certain movies that are created simply for the sake of fun time but this flick just didn cut it for me it was boring for stretches the acting was atrocious at times the romantic scene between suvari and chambers next to the lake reminded me of plays in high school which made you cringe there was little reason to care for anyone and since when were the musketeers fat will give the movie this much and that is that its main reason for being its raison etre as the french would say its fight sequences do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film was hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer but what you see there are essentially the snippets from the two major and cool swashbuckling sequences from the film the first comes right at the beginning of the movie while the other essentially finishes the film off hanging from the tower and juggling off ladders the ladder sequence itself is definite keeper but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap and can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this film credits hullo the film is called the musketeer and stars dude name justin chambers deneuve is barely in this movie ugh just another small thing that annoyed me about this trash now say it together gang all for one and one for all we vow to stay away from it all thank me later where joblo coming from knight tale 10 american outlaws 10 crouching tiger hidden dragon 10 the matrix 10 the replacement killers 10 romeo must die 10 shanghai noon 10
and now the high flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics and it isn pretty this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer version of dumas the three musketeers by bringing in popular asian actor stunt coordinator xing xing xiong whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting the end result is tepid and dull action adventure rip off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay artagnan justin chambers is the vengeful son of slain musketeer he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents in paris he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu stephen rea who is trying to overthrow the king and richelieu man in black associate febre tim roth the killer of his folks he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk so he rounds up aramis nick moran athos jan gregor kremp and porthos steven spiers to free the musketeer wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king prison artagnan and his new frisky love interest chambermaid francesca mena suvari play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen catherine deneuve ends up being captured by the menancing febre forcing the musketeers to regroup with artagnan leading the charge and save the day director peter hyams end of days obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles but here it disaster one problem is that in reality most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones jet li high risk is rip off of die hard not the other way around ironically there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20 to 30 minute action sequences because they know the scenes have to carry the picture the musketeer instead weighs itself down with predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano sudden death horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers the wedding planner to deliver his mousy self as leader chambers artangnan isn musketeer he mouseketeer and hyam use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well noted but that the only standout in an overall flat production
reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger scream and arlington rd are the others each derivative in their own special way the guy can seem to write believable dialogue sample from reindeer games rule #1 never put car thief behind the wheel create multi faceted characters or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of punishment with no reward anywhere in sight can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard oh you thought my movie was gonna go here ck you jack ass take that twist decipher this mother cker it almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is auteur theory be damned it kruger style not the director that winds up on screen kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut sometimes less is more and his numerous twists can even claim to be originals arlington rd ending is direct steal from the much better alan pakula thriller the parallax view and in reindeer games we get this ol gem character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn know pronouns used to protect the gender of the character grammar be damned how did you know that the stunned protagonist asks suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along since twist endings are currently so in vogue and seeing as how kruger screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending guess it no wonder why he works so frequently he quickly becoming miramax mickey mouse the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects this is appropriate considering that miramax which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films has quickly become grindhouse for coddling foreign imports life is beautiful and freddie prinze jr vehicles their company current logo could be we ride the trends reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through police academy flick affleck is such puppy dog that it impossible to believe he could survive in harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone bitch the role itself is so badly written the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it the twists so outrageous and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as can recall recent serious movie getting it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy who played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance james frain is nick rudy cellmate manslaughterer who found pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason charlize theron ashley is prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she never seen one picture of him which works out fine since the character is killed in near riot and rudy who was to be paroled on the same day as nick takes his place which leads to sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy so frenzied it kinda looks like rape and surprise visit from ashley brother gabriel gary sinise who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co horts he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley used to work as guard in the indian casino though by the end the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything ve described might as well be irrelevant this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on several scenes in which after catching his prey the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has chance to kill his captor and crack stupid one liner included two scenes of two different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him one following the other no less though it an action film the ending is more talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on incredulous as the audience the flick was directed by john frankenheimer straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career fell off the list following string of flops and now in his old age is slowly climbing his way back up it would be success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin one of those almost but not quite movies which followed the island of dr morneau you remember the one with marlon brando in mime make up and not so flattering moo moo and now this he films action sequences with minimum of quick cutting which like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for brain zapped mtv audience to pick apart problem is these action scenes nearly all failed escapes serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than filmed radio play character problems abound rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre the latter of which is not at least at this point something ben affleck is capable of pulling off the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating tarantino gangster charlize theron an extraordinary talent is like affleck playing whatever part the script requires her to play whether it be vulnerability at one moment anger at the next she never has chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this gary sinise has played this role frequently and here as in snake eyes he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more that it becomes more of an annoyance oh there he goes again than threat these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to script with little but stock characters and bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience
one sided doom and gloom documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he along with best selling author hal lindsey discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent well for 1976 anyway events the film is dated badly as many things that are supposed to happen in the future never do for example the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth we re still here the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick off the apocalypse we re still here some of the more ludicrous moments come when it alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist also there ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like if it anything like it depicted as here then it going to be incredibly boring the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video it contains the film in standard form aspect ratio of 33 although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed also included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey as well as trailer for another recent vci home video release chariots of the gods audio is mono dolby digital and the video is fair to good for film like this believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me certainly never expected remastered print curiously the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case but they re menu screens so who really cares [pg]
play it to the bone the newest addition to ron shelton sports themed repertoire fails in numerous ways like most of shelton other great films bull durham beyaz men can jump this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots shelton films are not considered sports films but they do heavily revolve around specific game to tell story shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull but the side story of the two guys and girl travelling across the country is even worse the film has no social message like its predecessors the relationship between the friends two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars is very confusing for number of reasons the whole film since it is primarily buddy picture depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other unfortunately it is very weak bond for the reasons listed below we never see how cesar antonio banderas and vince woody harrelson meet the two are so different from each other that scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something the third character on the trip grace lolita davidovich stands in the way she is in nearly every scene with them making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other there are two many interfering irrelevant side stories vince is convinced that he sees jesus on regular basis cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner these boring tales only hurt the central plot when it comes to time for the two men to fight they don even hesitate to pound each other wasn the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with the film wants to be over shelton on the other hand continues to tell his story forty five painful minutes remain the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies however the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile kind of like the whole film
wish could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of sports film bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying it would be very light comedic version of any given sunday and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach throw in that hunk of guy keanu reeves and cast of wacky characters and poof we ll have hit on our hands the replacements is hokey mistake of football film mishmash collage of one dimensional characters rampant stereotypes of cultures and races cliched emotional statements of purpose and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography the story is loosely based around the pro football players strike in 1987 and rag tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels keanu reeves stars as shane falco has been football college player looking for redemption gene hackman dons fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like certain coach in hoosiers rounding out the cast includes swingers jon favreau up pitchman orlando jones gruff owner jack warden and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters the drunken welshman the overweight sumo wrestler the siyah convict the violent cop and the dumb dumb cheerleaders this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny the usual things happen like clockwork the hero rises from the ashes of failure the team comes together in unity the hero falls in love with conventional love interest the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax it also shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks howard deutch who was behind the camera for two of the best films of 80s pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes obviously the problem is that without good script any director will fail in the end sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds the rise and fall of gallant heroes and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life the replacements offers none of this
lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient great acting music and cinematography were nice but too many dull sub plots and characters made the film hard to follow ralph fiennes strange days schindler list gives gripping performance as count laszlo almasy victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy the story revolves around his past in flashback form making it even more confusing anyway he is taken in by hana juliette binoche the horseman on the roof boring war torn nurse she was never really made into anything until she met an indian towards the end developing yet another sub plot count almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by stranger willem dafoe basquiat his love kirstin scott thomas mission impossible was severely injured in plane crash and eventually died in cave he returned to find her dead and was heart broken so he flew her dead body somewhere but was shot down from the ground don get the wrong idea it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting but good is the last thing this film is maybe if it were an hour less it may have been tolerable but hours and 40 minutes of talking is too much to handle the only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography other than these the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film

talk about movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters spice world is the feature film debut of the pre fabricated pop band the spice girls it intended as sort of hard day night but ends up simply hard to watch when watching the spice girls reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick such as from the smurfs the snorks or teenage mutant ninja turtles in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and different name the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles and about as talented there ginger geri halliwell the brainy one sporty melanie chisholm the athletic one baby emma bunton the childish one posh victoria adams the fashion conscious one and scary melanie brown the one with tongue pierced back so far you re almost certain the post sticks out her throat the film itself doesn really have plot it follows the girls as they travel here and there culminating at their first live performance at albert hall the action however seems more like hodgepodge of mismatched ideas the various misfires include an alien encounter fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls the shooting of spice girls documentary movie producer george wendt trying to pitch various ideas for spice girls movie nearly all of which though incredibly far fetched seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up meeting with pregnant friend whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends boating adventure bus race club hopping wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd even when they start to sing and an assorted number of musical performances press conferences and general all around celebrity stuff whew for some reason the film is littered with star cameos from elton john to elvis costello from bob hoskins to meat loaf heck even roger moore shows up though he can decide if he parodying himself as james bond or if he lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld richard grant has the largest secondary part thankless role of the band manager clifford the celebrity spotting is partially amusing and decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film neither amusing or spontaneous when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring their songs are alright but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos my advice to fans is stay home and watch that video collection or at least spin that cd couple of more times either option will be more enjoyable than the film non fans should know to stay well away from this one
has it really been two decades since walter matthau coached the bad news bears nineteen years and two mighty ducks later the formula is still going strong police academy graduate steve guttenberg stars as small town deputy sheriff corralled into co coaching the school hastily formed soccer team his partner in crime is the new british exchange teacher olivia abo lively lass who has obviously seen dangerous minds and knows that the best way to gain the respect of disinterested outer city audience is to teach them something neat like soccer most of the good natured gags are of the fast motion variety such as runaway cows and out of control lawnmowers kids will laugh at the occasional belching bit while their parents peacefully doze beside them other than letting supporting character named newt go unscathed what missing from the big green is better integration of music and comedy instead of peppy pop score which would arguably work to better effect most of the action is set to bombastic orchestral score that belongs somewhere else comedy needs music just watch any old bugs bunny short the marx brothers knew it mel brooks knows it unfortunately the current trend is to overscore lush strings and booming brass in every scene at every moment remember the simple strains of bizet habanera in the original bad news bears these days it usually bellowing fanfare that threatens to smother every scene in its path much like adding frosting to already frosted cake an awfully big adventure ======================== the reteaming of director mike newell and star hugh grant is about as far removed as you can get from the lightsome comedy of four weddings and funeral their second collaboration is downbeat theatrical drama about young intern georgina cates struggling to survive in post ii liverpool hugh plays the gay director an extremely unappealing character who may alienate whatever fans are left after the nonsense of nine months bleak make up and thick accents conspire to make this difficult story to settle into an awful adventure is not without some rewards tho the peter pan subtext is intriguing as is the diverse ensemble cast that includes peter firth alan rickman and prunella scales basil devil in mavi dress ===================== the comparisons to chinatown are easy enough except for the fact that this film isn nearly as gripping writer director carl franklin one false move is the force behind this accomplished but stiff adaptation of walter mosley crime novel denzel washington is as sturdy as ever but he burdened with miscast supporting cast tom sizemore and scene stealer don cheadle are both fine the problems start with jennifer beales who never registers as the plot femme fatale she pretty face and nothing more also underweight are maury chaykin and terry kinney they play opposing mayoral candidates in 1948 los angeles and neither actor commands enough authority to stifle giggles john huston we miss you fine period detail and strong sense of humor are plus they help to overcome pace that too polite for mosley jazzy swingin story steal big steal little ======================= can say much about this one director andrew davis follows the fugitive with wildly unfunny farce about twin brothers andy garcia with opposing moral codes they re fighting over their adoptive mother estate 40 000 acre ranch worth millions and supporting dozens of migrant farm workers so many different plots are trying to come together feuding brothers reconciling husbands loan shark hired hitmen that you have to admire the director ambition too bad that almost every single person or plot line is out of sync that is with the exception of alan arkin he the best thing in movie that despite the work of four credited writers still manages to waste such diverse talents as david odgen stiers kevin mccarthy and joe pantolinao and what the heck does that title mean
rated for strong violence language drug use nudity and some sexuality starring wesley snipes anne archer michael chaykin donald sutherland marie matiko running time 117 minutes directed by christian duguay ve never fully understood wesley snipes career he has his ups and downs but mostly the downs his best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that movie was entitled blade he has had his typical action movies boiling point passenger 57 but his new movie the art of war should just be called rising sun the art of war cause basically it semi remake of the same plot with different cast and forced to be ridiculously unbelievable thriller that is high on style and low on substance wesley snipes plays james bondish type secret agent working for the after chinese ambassador is killed he is on the track of the killer trying to find out who it is how it happened where the killer was and what to do anne archer plays his boss type person of the and she has hired snipes to track down the killer well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer and is now an outlaw kidnapping chinese woman with him and having her help him along the way all this leads to finale that is so dumb and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb and the stunts dialogue and acting all ruin this movie wesley snipes isn one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998 blade walked into the art of war expecting good high octane thriller and all got was pile of mush the only real good thing the movie has is action and plenty of it but noticed it is badly filmed the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on the ending finale is so worthless and pitiful that it even tries to mock the matrix laughably funny it is undeniably stupid christian duguay direction is also not that great his camera angles and sense of style are all in place but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done even the whole matrix ending wasn even good the stunts and action are badly filmed and badly choreographed his placing of the characters and the assination of the chinese ambassador and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie anne archer who is usually good in her roles turns in horrible job here she is sour downbeat and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue and dumb moves even donald sutherland as co star can save this movie from being bust so for an overall opinion the art of war is total waste of time it not entertaining nor exciting or even action packed it is pointless movie and makes absolutely no sense at all if you really want to see good version of the art of war rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind rising sun it isn great film either but at least it better than this
first rule of fight club is don talk about fight club this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film because quite frankly it not even worth mentioning director david fincher seven has completely gone over the edge with crude humor an intolerable script and hours and 19 minutes of pure torture surprised didn walk out this just goes to show that hype kills it very rare that film so hyped up as fight club turns out to be noteworthy and this is no exception the story goes like this edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to variety of disease therapy sessions until he meets marla helena bonham carter norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle when he spots her at session that he also attended apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like literally living in pain why any person would think of such thing is beyond me but things do get worse norton is soon assigned to job that calls for traveling and it on plane that he meets tyler durden brad pitt the two men develop bond and go out to bar and by golly after they get drunk the two pitiful characters fight how do they come up with this stuff anyway their fighting catches other pathetic loser attention and club is formed out of all this mess there manages to lie message fincher shows us that society is like robots we work in our jobs doing things step by step and want out our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are and we blame it on others call me crazy but this is common knowledge think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably even with two good actors and solid actress they only manage to weaken the story couldn help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into bloody pulp it just shows how desperate the script is for attention guess brad pitt was right for this role because felt like beating him up myself his bothersome and depressing character made me disgusted at his 20 million fee it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more helena bonham carter however really had no purpose she just popped up on screen mumbled some lines smoked and left this continues for what seems like hours the film drags on and my headache gets bigger while fight club nears what think might be the end unfortunately by then the film hits rock bottom though the conclusion kept my interest for mere minutes it backs down again and continues to move at snails pace on side note the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn lesson concentrating on the atmosphere or particular key moment won do any good if everything else is in need of support also afraid that immature men might respond to the film violence the last thing the world needs is people praising leader of pointless cult when the film ends just glad to get home and take some advil you ll either enjoy what the film has to offer or agree with ed norton when he says this is so ing stupid
for better or worse the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to whole slew of overheated oversexed underwritten thrillers apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn change thing since body of evidence wasn written by him but has puzzling eszterhas ish presence all over it in other words it really dirty and really really stupid madonna first warning sign stars in body of evidence as woman who has piles of money and no apparent job she lives on houseboat and likes to parade around semi naked presumably for the edification of the shrimp she been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect the first being that any woman in movie cannot be sexual unless she under thirty or at least looks it and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men what worse is that the movie confirms all the above and wallows in them as well madonna character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had heart condition and yes there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy this movie leave no scummy stone unturned anyway willem dafoe very good but completely wasted also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna sexuality how do we know this because his character is set up with the token wife and kids how obvious is it that he gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up and get kicked out of the house and get welcomed back anyway don skip to the end yet we re just getting warmed up dafoe and madonna have lot of sex in this movie most of it is about as erotic as open heart surgery since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don know the first thing about really kinky sex and smashed light bulbs don ask another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story it insanely dull what worse is that body of evidence is dull everywhere not just in the sex scenes the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes the thriller business itself is ridiculous it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs and juergen prochnow as surly doctor and the ending another homage to eszterhas maybe is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact frame where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in the director is uli edel all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane everyone has to eat guess but this isn meal ticket it leftovers
capsule the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension alien the should be in superscript is sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen it continues the story of ripley the space trucker turned impromptu survivalist but seems remarkably uninterested in her in fact the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all it so elegaic and limp little of this would have been nice for atmosphere but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning at the end of the last film aliens ripley and two survivors were on their way home unfortunately an alien pod had been deposited in their ship and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod the pod crashes on firorina 161 prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent ripley lives through the crash the others do not the prison is grim place even as prisons go it been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks which provides no end of techno gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against lice are endemic and so ripley head is shaved another surreal touch at first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until company rescue ship can arrive but it doesn stay that way one of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches and soon newly gestated alien is running amuck worse it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated what weird is how little tension this generates except near the end when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable loud music shaky camerawork etc sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role and she does well with it but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack the supporting actors are also not given lot to do the doctor charles dance and another rather religious inmate charles dutton very good hiave presence but they re not asked to do anything with it in light of the impending sequel which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie will not talk about the ending except to say that they found remarkably good ending for such drab movie it strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn have driven the rest of it
love to kill starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes at the outset the movie appears to be about tony danza who an illegal distributor of guns trying to establish relationship with an unsuspecting woman danza sets up double date with her her sister and collegue of his everything seems to be going well until the sister accidentally dies by falling down set of stairs much confusion and mahem ensues as the death is covered up and other associates of danza begin to emerge all after one thing or another sound confusing it is think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in little humour and levity in some respects it works but the majority of the film is convoluted and confusing mess characters keep popping up with no explanation demanding money for deals that occur off screen the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman sister but so little time is devoted to this part of the story we never really become too familiar with these characters and because of this we don really care what happens to them well didn at least one thing will give the movie is that it complete departure for tony danza here guy because of his many sitcom roles who ingrained in the consciousness as nice guy who always does the right thing here he plays man who just looking out for himself and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin so be it was very impressed by his performance and within minutes of the start of the film had forgotten all about his good guy persona michael madsen is also good as an associate of danza who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him like said it not exactly linear storyline love to kill should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre but it just too bad that the story doesn really add up to much the stars deserved better and so did the audience
susan granger review of ghosts of mars sony pictures entertainment horror auteur john carpenter halloween vampires strikes out with this sci fi eco fable that so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got green lit the script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last year pitch siyah involving violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help small band of humans protect themselves from blood thirsty marauding aliens in the year 2176 there are 640 000 earthlings on mars living in matriarchal society led by commander played by pam grier grier pill poppin natasha henstridge and some rookie mars police officers clea duvall jason statham travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch desolation williams that ice cube to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder but when they re besieged by demented zombie like body snatching miners they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection it seems kirmizi cloud was released from shining canyon cave and soon after most of the miners went bonkers as long dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies lopping off heads as vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet according to scientist joanna cassidy carpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the night of the living dead like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing but you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed along with the order of their elimination on the granger movie gauge of to 10 ghosts of mars thuds to laborious bottom of the barrel perhaps indeed there is curse on mars films if you recall two other duds mission to mars and kirmizi planet
dead bang an action thriller starring don johnson lives up to its dumb title or at least to half of it although dead bang is definitely dead it is anything but bang in fact they should have called this one dead bore in the film johnson plays you guessed it cop the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character jerry beck is gritty los angeles homicide detective real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on miami vice la mel gibson in lethal weapon beck is an emotional wreck complete with violent outbursts unscrupulous police methods and bleak outlook on life beck wife has just divorced him and she is cutting him off from their children she will not even allow him to wish them merry christmas by telephone but beck family and emotional problems take back seat to the action and thrills in dead bang beck is investigating the brutal murders of shopkeeper and cop his investigation starts in and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma where he has violent showdown with the killers at beyaz supremacist camp virtually every aspect of dead bang is inept and ineffective the plot is incoherent and full of holes the movie depicts beck investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions the action sequences in dead bang are strictly third rate and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense certainly expected more from long time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller the manchurian candidate as well as siyah sunday seven days in may and the french connection ii in all fairness to frankenheimer however should note that most of dead bang shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction dead bang tries to don mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and beyaz supremacy but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting according to the movie production notes dead bang is based on the real life experiences of still active detective jerry beck you would never guess this from watching dead bang however since the film totally lacks credibility it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable most of the characters in dead bang are either atrociously acted underdeveloped superfluous or all of the above william forsythe for example is painfully bad as arthur kressler wholesome by the book fbi agent who offended by beck foul language and unorthodox methods forsythe lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable dead bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid wkrp in cincinnati and frank place but his talents are completely wasted in cliched and contrived role he plays the chief officer of squadron of siyah cops who help beck to nail the villains the sole function of penelope ann miller character is to give dead bang an excuse to include gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less guess the film title refers to this love scene since it definitely dead bang the only real virtue of dead bang believe it or not is don johnson who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie pitiful script johnson succeeds in giving his character sarcastic sense of humor and hint of depth and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life and must admit that dead bang does have one or two amusing moments the funniest scene has johnson throwing up all over criminal as he interrogates him but when barf is the highlight of movie you know the movie in trouble the other amusing scene involves psychological examination of beck in which he can keep straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen but two funny scenes and couple good wisecracks do not movie make
some houses are born bad goes the haunting tag line to which must add some movies too nothing short of hiring new cast more literate screenwriter and new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson meritorious novel the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don frighten so much as numb the audience into submission the film is like rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout boo fragile nell taylor bisexual theo zeta jones and smiley luke wilson are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders hosted by professor marrow neeson marrow secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house bleak history he not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew nell especially who has some ancestral connection to the manor previous inhabitants taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big budget lead for starters her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes when we re introduced to the mansion and all its fun house trappings her character is supposed to be depressed having tended to an unloving mother for too many years but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame alternately grouchy mopey wiggy and pathetic and kept wondering why the other characters didn just ditch this bitch as for the obscenely photogenic zeta jones she breezes through her scenes with wink and smile and takes the scenery with her unfortunately she saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer theo assessment of the house love it sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters who on earth would say that in place of citizen kane meets the munsters furthermore would you gladly spend single night in house befitting that description both actresses fare better than neeson who looks embarrassed to be part of this ensemble and for good reason and his character is the most bland as luke puts it dr marrow pulls the old academic bait and switch on his subjects but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he accused later he risks his life by climbing crumbling stairwell to save nell it amusing to hear neeson shout nell repeatedly given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name why was this nice helpful and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti his sets are obsessively detailed and even before the cgi kicks in they seem alive never quite still do have one beef with this aspect of the production the real life mansion used in exterior shots nottinghamshire harlaxton manor is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins always finish up in locations that were established in act one as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting and despite powerhouse box office debut doubt it will recoup its costs including marketing domestically thank jan de bont for that proving for the third time that speed was fluke in that it was actually enjoyable de bont has served up another ride sans thrill his images well lit though they are have an unmistakable been there done that quality in fact whole sequences not to mention the cloaked airy ghoul who owns the climax feel lifted from much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back peter jackson the frighteners don mean to suggest de bont is plagiarist mean to suggest that he hack having found no new ways to give us chills
deceiver is plot twist in search of movie this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises and being true to its title being deceptive but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit braxton chris penn and kennesaw michael rooker are two cops investigating the brutal murder of prostitute renee zellweger their lone suspect is wayland tim roth wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker pocket however routine lie detector test turns against the investigators as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables braxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives braxton is gambling addict in deep to mook ellen burstyn local bookie kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to socialite rosanna arquette believing his wife to be unfaithful the plot is twisty and complex with lots of lengthy flashbacks and plenty of surprises however there are times when it is needlessly complex and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost take look at confidential or the film more likely inspiration the usual suspects for how complex plot can properly be handled the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot for example the film tells few substories such as the tale of woeful absinthe bender or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable there never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation they appear to be nothing more than words on screenplay the characters themselves are rather pathetic and despicable not one of them is an ounce sympathetic and as result the labyrinthine plot is all for naught what does it matter who is guilty of what and why writer directors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers masterwork blood simple or the wachowski brothers less worthy bound but while they have got the plot twists down cold they need to work on characterization and dialogue
starship troopers is bad movie mean really really bad movie not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood gore and body parts shown on the screen it blissfully jumps over that line apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds of which saw many in the theatre looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence we are left with movie with thin plot at best no strong lead characters blatant disregard for physics and very obvious naziesque theme that being said onto the review the movie starts with propaganda message from the federation who logo bears strong resemblance to nazi german eagle urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs who are attempting to destroy earth the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance pledging allegiance to the federation again sound familiar as the movie progresses we are shown terror tactic training as drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm and throws knife through another hand eventually the recruits embark on journey to location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy to fight the bugs on their home planet as our faster than light travelling heroes arrive on planet they drop onto the planet and burst our of their craft brandishing what you say laser beam weapons sonic weapons phasers photon cannons nope they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns pump action rifles and tactical nuclear weapons guess lot of physics money r&d went into travel and not weaponry as the assault begins our group of troopers are seen walking in straight line through box canyon two members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them and one even sees streak fly by but disregards it as nothing this of course leads to more massive carnage blood shed and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies again see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons in the end we see neil patrick doogie howser harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as nazi ss trenchcoat hat and gloves he does vulcan mind meld on the giant slug and then proclaims that the bugs are scared this sets the troopers into frenzy as they are now one step closer to completing their goal total genocide of species again sound familiar have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review but given it non existence may have anyway could go on for pages ripping this movie apart but don want to bore you too badly in short felt as if were subjected to mix between pro nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies drivers education accident scene film and complete blank screen the plot of course wouldn recommend this movie to anyone anywhere under any circumstance copyright 1997 tim jandt
poster boy for co dependency needs patching patch adams film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman mediocrity is pox on civilization in our heavily consumer oriented society there is an enormous demand to churn out stuff what would happen to our economy if we didn feel the need to have more things to make us buy more businesses need to produce ton of product the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality the film industry is like any other in order for studios to survive they have to make money the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that less talented people are used there aren enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary for some reason it never crossed anyone mind that the real equation is quality films more profit often mediocre films are more of pain for the audience than the horrendous ones at you can have good time making fun of bad movies not suggesting that patch adams was tossed out just to rake in the bucks my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel it features an accomplished actor and potentially engrossing story but it as dull as could be hunter patch adams robin williams desire to become doctor has an unusual genesis checking himself into mental institute after suicide attempt he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around patch could be poster boy for co dependency he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesn focus on his own problems he decides that he wants to be physician leaves the place and couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia as med student patch antics at the school hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch enemy straight laced dean walcott bob gunton the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he one of the top students he writes in patch academic file that he shows excessive happiness walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies then it struck me it must be based on true story the movie is an adaptation of book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute free clinic robin williams is an amazing actor while he is adept at dramatic roles his forte is over the top free spirits that what makes his failure here so remarkable patch is exactly the character he should be best at yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat something holds him back most of the rest of the cast is two dimensional for film that champions seeing patients as human beings it curious that the ones here are cardboard characters peter coyote as man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like real person unfortunately he in the film for only about two minutes the audience is blatantly lead by ring in its nose from scene to scene we re not left to our own emotional decisions we re hit over the head with them shaved headed children with cancer an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh beautiful woman who can love because of her abusive history when group of students fix up an old house to use as clinic in the andy hardy hey let put on play we can use the barn and my mom can make the curtains mode they laugh and roll around while painting each other there might as well be giant signs flashing feel good now feel bad now patch is good title for the film it is patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of the full of life student fights stodgy establishment types there touching death then there another the film doesn trust us to get it the first time the dean tries to kick patch out and later he tries again worst of all is the final courtroom bit scary looking old men sit in judgment of man who only wants to help people the room is packed with patch supporters williams makes supposedly impassioned speech about the humanity of all it has as much emotion as his earlier statement humans are the only animal that kills members of its own species contains truth most of the blame must be placed with the director tom shadyac and screenwriter steve oedekerk shadyac also directed the first ace ventura movie oedekerk directed the second one need say more the real adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as people rather than diseases the film has number of worthy messages about the state of the modern medical business with hmos and managed care the doctors are not gods theme will resonate with number of people but it so poorly produced that no one will care
this is the last carry on film with its almost intact regular cast and it is the swansong of hattie jacques and sid james dick turpin sid james and his gang which includes harriett harry barbara windsor and tom doc scholl peter butterworth terrorise the countryside by staging highway robberies stand and deliver owing to the increased occurrence of turpin robberies captain desmond fancey of the bow street runners kenneth williams and his sidekick sergeant jock strapp jack douglas visit turpin area of influence to bring him to justice they are under the express orders of sir roger daley bernard bresslaw their intellect does not count for much and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin sid james whom they confided in earlier they still cannot believe that the rector has any part in these robberies however once they catch harriett and put her in jail and sir roger daley takes complete charge it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin then again sir roger has assigned the dimwits fancey and jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable kenneth connor to keep an eye on their prisoner there is no doubt that this is sid james carry on movie he excels in double roles as in carry on don lose your head and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang and hattie jacques small but effective role as the rector housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection jack douglas plays milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on screen persona and kenneth williams is given rather mundane part peter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom and bernard bresslaw character appears only briefly in the film the only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the birds of paradise and sporting fake french accent when her girls and her are robbed by turpin she is determined to catch him and helps the reverend to find the culprit carry on by the numbers this movie is only notable for the great performance by sid james in his last carry on movie the jokes are bluer the script is poorer it is the last script written by talbot rothwell but the music is marked improvement although nearly all the regulars appear they seem to be just going through the motions none of the high spirits of the earlier films are apparent here just selection of crude jokes and repititive double entendres
one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek the star of the wb runaway hit dawson creek following in the foot steps of mtv two other live action films joe apartment 1996 and dead man on campus 1998 varsity blues is bad film and is unlikely to cause much of sensation in the marketplace set in west cannan texas the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john mox moxon van der beek we know he smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook coach bud kilmer jon voight has been around so long there is actually bronze statue commemorating him the star quarterback lance harbor paul walker is handsome blonde hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader darcy ali larter also on the team are an enormous guy ron lester with some health problems and the token african american team member eliel swinton whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin when lance is seriously injured mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend jules amy smart is threatened and there big game at the end guess who wins nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love there chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow van der beek does decent job of carrying his first film although silly accent trips him up sometimes also the role isn very much of stretch from his dawson leary character he still pseudo intellectual whiny nice guy except here he also happens to be jock voight is terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don fare much better on the positive side walker is charismatic actor who is due for breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville 1998 scott son of james caan has some lively moments as tweeder the team wild man larter as gorgeous seductress looking for one way ticket out of texas gets to show off the film most interesting costumes including very eye opening whipped cream bikini it interesting to note that the film definitely earns its rating with lot of harsh language alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity including gratuitous trip to strip bar that reveals not very surprising surprise all this is likely to come as shock to the young female fan base of dawson creek presumably the target audience for the picture director brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger from nickelodeon films sister company of mtv and changes directions here bit but still fails to make much of an impression the look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it the football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks bit washed out there an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul foo fighters green day and aaliyah but it not as impressive as one would expect from mtv film
come on hollywood surprise me stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset the always watchable morgan freeman plays detective who becomes personally involved in case involving missing girls personal because his niece is one of the victims it slobbering psychopath of course but this time there twist freeman notes that each of the young women who ve disappeared are all strong willed assertive and more successful in their careers than the average girl we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova whose aim is to dominate these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem anyway one of the women manages to escape ashly judd and teams up with freeman to well you know the rest brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants may suggest lambs also has fairly predictable story perhaps but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue so lets not insult great movie by taking the comparisons any further okay and as for comparisons to seven oh please kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass maybe the novel was stinker to start with but whatever the case it the writing that clearly at fault here one these characters have very little to say that engaging or interesting two the script has no sense of humour three while the notion of psycho victims being smart successful women is an interesting twist the execution isn even half as good as the idea thus ashly judd comes across all out of focus instead of being the heart of the story we can feel her rage some atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she the no bullshit 90 type but these conversations barely register and as for freeman kiss the girls is his second dog in year first chain reaction now this for an actor of his calibre this is most worrying young director gary fleder scored hit few years back with his quirky pulp fiction esque things to do in denver when your dead but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this not much and you can hardly blame him there few well staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls dives and jumps and the effect is startling but the script is beyond rescue what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up complacency rules it been so long since we saw mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue the only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was freebie positive proof that the best things in life aren free
certainly no one would rent ed wood glen or glenda expecting to see good movie but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays level of incompetence that didn know was possible in fact wood infamous plan from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison watching glen or glenda found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together as result it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious the movie starts out as what mostly seems like bad documentary with endless repetitive narration about transvestites how difficult it is for transvestite to look at his girlfriend clothes without being able to wear them how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals and how the main character glen glenda is as it reminds us probably half dozen times not half man and half woman but man and woman at the same time the camera work is terrible occasionally the camera lingers on say closed door while the characters talk off screen or inexplicably zooms in on someone ear or nose wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage which leads to voiced over non sequiturs like yes our world is busy and frightening place with so many people driving their automobiles finally there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit frankenstein style laboratory delivering pointless lines such as people all with their own thoughts their own ideas while lightning crackles quasi ominously overhead had wood continued in this vein glen or glenda probably would have been remembered as nothing more than poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horror movie touch unfortunately he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script pull the string pull the string announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears there is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns this time warning us beware beware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door it eats little boys and puppy dogs tails and big fat snails bizarre nightmare sequence which is probably meant to be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid ensues during which glen glenda finds his fiance trapped under fallen tree in the living room someone who is apparently intended to be the sinister green dragon but looks more like klingon from the original star trek series appears to be orchestrating all this though the film is far from clear on this point to put it kindly near the end of this scene and here must confess that wood lost me completely is violent sexual encounter on couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music after this scene ends not moment too soon glen or glenda returns to its documentary style but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone the film wanders to dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism but at that point it didn matter much what happened as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over glen or glenda had pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film had ever seen honestly think that if picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst movie possibly could it still might not match glen or glenda for sheer cinematic disaster am giving this movie an but not sure that quite does it justice
this is my first review that post to this newsgroup and kind of feel like have to say something negative about this film no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with historical story however even if one thinks of it as fiction the prince of egypt remains shallow but ll begin from the beginning the biggest difference between the original biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible whereas the animated version gives the impression of reluctant hero maybe it just me but if knew had god on my side have little bit more confidence there are other differences as well such as lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoah death like it nothing but thing most of all though the story focus has shifted rather than being story about father son man ethnicity man god the prince of egypt is almost solely about the brother brother relationship between rameses and moses was originally excited about this story element until saw the movie where it came off as maudlin rameses and moses squabble like children and then in the interests of peace moses saves rameses butt even though moses was the one who started it yawn didn care anymore by the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer which of course never happened in the original story moses was exiled but enough about the differences let talk about the movie itself it features moses who in the interests of making the character more human lacks any divinity whatsoever which isn convincing at all to anyone who knows who god is it features cookie cutter wanna please dada rameses who at least is given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes from schindler list among other things the film also features an extremely annoying character by way of the new improved miriam voiced by the ever antsy sandra bullock even though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst into song for no apparent reason here bullock is replaced by singing voice speaking of which it contains very annoying music it contains shallow writing it features extraordinary animation which is one good thing can say about this film most of all it contains an attempt to commercialize homogenize and mass market story about manifestation of god am not christian but got the impression of blasphemy the writers and producers took butcher knife and chop chopped into the story
would appreciate it if you didn do that again starring jet li bridget fonda tch ky karyo burt kwouk directed by chris nahon rated it no secret that martial arts film often use their plot simply to get from one action sequence to another when the fight scenes are enough to justify paying admission there is no problem with this as in most jackie chan projects and lot of the hong kong actioners when they aren well we re in bad shape kiss of the dragon jet li second consecutive american misfire plays like one big miscalculation and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment now before start getting mails angrily touting the genius of jet li let me explain myself li is as spectacular as ever here and don think anyone would ever dare call his martial arts star skills into question the problem isn with him it with the movie tone the much touted fight scenes here are filmed with such unflinching unrelenting brutality that they are unpleasant to watch they re joyless perfuctory li rogue chinese detective is more of killing machine than hero terminator with siyah belt instead of metal skeleton but even the terminator in judgement day had sympathetic side the plot isn relevant but if you re curious it some nonsense about chinese law enforcement officer li sent to paris to investigate possible drug ring and encounter corrupt chief of police tcheky karyo who kills people and does sinister things with no motivation whatsoever oh yeah and li character is also an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain and or kill at the touch of needle kiss of the dragon is the name of an acupuncture maneuver in which you stick needle in precise location on the back of the victim neck somehow redirecting all of the body bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor sap more or less immediately there vague attempt to humanize li by having him fall in love with downtrodden prostitute whose daughter is being held hostage for some reason by the villain this is one of the worst love stories have ever seen on screen even worse than the one in pearl harbor there no conviction whatsoever as the movie barely pays lip service to it it only here because someone apparently thought there should be some kind of boy meets girl subplot kiss of the dragon was written by luc besson whose screenplay the messenger the story of joan of arc for all of that film flaws was at least thoughtful don know why the guy got himself involved in this train wreck but perhaps he wanted to so something more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of the fifth element and the aforementioned stylized biopic suppose you could call this mainstream but ll choose the bizarre any time of the day if action scenes in movie are going to be brutal instead of dazzling you need story to justify watching them the filmmakers behind kiss of the dragon should have rethought their strategy no one will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling but hear rush hour is coming in just few weeks
at the outset of swordfish john travolta gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today basically he says it boils down to lack of imagination among the majority of writers how ironic as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture swordfish is loud violent and amoral it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life and how does travolta gabriel plan to do this by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out terrorize terrorists swordfish is very cynical movie it relies on an audience perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non human faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration the movie plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down you actually see how ridiculous it all is this is live action road runner cartoon moving so quickly that it over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson hugh jackman recruited by gabriel to crack the government computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti terrorist campaign talk about whacked out patriotism my objections to swordfish are many the body count is high but that is expected in movie of this sort it becoming bore watching anonymous soldiers police officers and government agents blown to bits another example is the family dynamics between stanley his 10 year old daughter and his ex wife stanley though having served time in prison for hacking is shown as loving and caring father forbidden by his ex to see his little girl audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband adult films thus when she is found murdered late in the movie neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve in fact subconsciously many in the audience are probably glad she was killed then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel henchman holding gun to the head of stanley daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel children as pawns have become most unwelcome clich in recent films there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on screen victims as well yea it only make believe but that doesn mean you have to tolerate it travolta is cool deadly charming and flamboyant as the near crazy gabriel his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face off jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel assistant while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel swordfish plays like comic book with larger than life character in gabriel viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain and maybe that is the movie underlying flaw there is no real hero to speak of only those doing their upmost to survive and that is not enough this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water
the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending watching one of these movies everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise when the film ends there is moment of confusion then recollection then some more confusion then possibly second viewing for clarification this is description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more good surprises make movies fun to watch then there are the bad twists you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie talking about you reindeer games or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid screwed perfectly suits the latter description what starts out as dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with group of friends ends with complex finale with way too much going on by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs larry flynt scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take stab at film directing whoops screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments norm macdonald stars as willard filmore hard working chauffeur who just wants little respect from his rich old insidious boss miss crock elaine stritch when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day willard is convinced by his best friend rusty dave chapelle to kidnap crock beloved dog and hold it for ransom of one million dollars too excited to pay any attention the hapless losers plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends realizing they can make even more money decide to stage the fake kidnapping of course everything that could go wrong does the first forty five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad but the convoluted script eventually builds into disaster that is impossible to bear the more idiotic these characters get the more reckless the script becomes at one point wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters no you idiot not just talking about willard and rusty who were extremely annoying also talking about the cops in this film monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys headed by murder one daniel benzali were just too clueless to forgive they give real cops bad names also poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down role these days looking almost identical to his penguin in batman returns every time he appeared on the screen had to shake my head in disbelief he just didn belong in this movie macdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was gross out humor is certainly not his forte if you re fan of norm macdonald other chaotic comedy dirty work you might actually love this near sequel otherwise don get screwed out of your hard earned money
vampire is rude chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as pawns of abuse present only to pleasure men feed vampires readied to be bashed or beaten till one sensibilities is shocked by the low iq and mentality of this regressive movie to make matters worse the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks and deserve to have their heads bitten off if not their bodies carved in half the dilemma of hating the heroes as much as the villains makes one wish that the hand of god would suddenly appear and blast both parties into oblivion james wood portrays jack crow man obsessed with killing vampires whose soul reason for living is based on revenge they killed his parents but this is not good excuse for being more obnoxious than the vampires as for adam baldwin he is nothing more than stooge who is ordered to beat women when the director shouts action and the script should have been reworked to avoid much offence against the female sex as for the claims that the catholic church created dracula well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion outside the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury with enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame an awful movie on all counts my suggestion is to bring back buffy and bury this group of incompetent rude vampire slayers
synopsis humorless police officer life changes when he befriends super smart super adorable golden retriever named einstein and cute young blond scientist unfortunately einstein shares psychic link with bigfoot sized ape creature trained by the blond scientist to be an unstoppable killing machine and this rogaine nightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl meanwhile group of beyaz chain smoking gun toting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie comments watchers reborn cheaply made direct to video turkey is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontz bestselling novel watchers technically this should have been called watchers but it seems that this cycle of horror movies much like many other sequel crazy film series has decided to drop the numbers from the titles even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be good movie instead of crappy fifth installment of film series which should have died long time ago this really isn good movie have you ever rented movie and recieved sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation well any hope viewer may have had perhaps because he is fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill will be dashed by the time he seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn they re awful these commercials cover films like strange stripper movie called shadow dancer some weird crap about dead indian teens and wolves and an action movie called detonator starring scott baio scott baio what idiot dreamed this movie up after surviving these abysmal trailers the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented watchers reborn maybe it won be that bad he may say to himself perhaps just perhaps the bottom of the barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading watchers reborn after all is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote decade ago it stars mark hamill luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy lou rawls is even in the mix unfortunately the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill he looks very sick here and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers the book the latter is really too bad koontz is hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good but he is still my favorite hack writer koontz has writing style which is succinct and suspenseful people who read many of his books however often complain of repetitive plot devices it definately not koontz book if there isn psychic super intelligent dog or psychotic killer who likes ripping out people eyeballs watchers has all three devices which may explain why it arguably the most popular of koontz books the idea behind koontz novel though highly implausible is very interesting basically biological war machine is created smart dog can be released in battle track down its target and then relay the target position psychically to large creature designed to kill in hand to hand combat silly but kind of neat too sorry don mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn the movie suppose just don want to talk about the movie itself this turkey is really cheesy no one in this movie can act including mark hamill and it difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero the cheese factor is only increased when he involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist geneticist zoologist whatever the she supposed to be whom he befriends mercifully the filmmakers opted not to do nudity to be honest the only half convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein you know movie is bad when dog outacts all of its human counterparts find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie and the creature yes the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in furry suit and mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling this creature is shot about 500 000 times but it okay the creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing oh he can also rip body parts off allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around cheesy gore that another main element of watchers reborn it has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film campiness rather than its suspense ultimately gave watchers reborn star and half because bad horror sci fi film buffs may get few kicks out of the film silliness though this film will tax even their patience it an 83 minute film but it feels like four hours also hate to admit have survived far worse than this anyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin fear the rush will know what mean finally couldn help but think that watchers reborn would work well as bot fodder for the creative folks behind one of my all time favorite shows mystery science theater 3000 this thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with smile on my face rated watchers reborn contains dozens of blood spattered bodies and unconvincing gore it also has violence obviously wouldn recommend it for the little kids but sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay instead of watching this film however recommend reading koontz book trust me it ll be time much much better spent
suppose it unfair to criticize movie like hudson hawk which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it 1991 release michael lehmann action comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time or close thereof the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk who just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation `let me put it this way he explains `i never saw et greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime played by danny aiello who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes these are rather welcome in movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences it appears as if director lehmann didn know when to stop all the absurd silliness and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn get goofier you ll soon be eating your words but inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it box office numbers suggest it fast paced and entertaining if you ve got incredible patience and warped sense of humor for the first portion of this review going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk wish me luck first and foremost bruce willis is good sport while not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co wrote this script willis is quite aware that the entire project is big fat ugly joke he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out of place which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character they meet when hudson goes on mission to steal priceless book from the vatican and their relationship escalates in interest from there it unfortunate that mcdowell one note character is used just as an excuse for there to be predictable plot twist and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis but now rambling on again about the negative things aren enough of the charade for the most part hudson hawk is an excruciating experience it stupid pointless and repetitive can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater because this film really doesn have the potential to please anyone action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy and even the action sequences are skittery rushed and poorly edited and those expecting hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache inducing hi jinks don get me wrong this film is not devoid of laughs it too bad most of them are unintentional or just plain forced the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed it understandable to see willis and aiello in movie of this caliber but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn not entirely sure coburn plays former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown and has fight with willis that would look right at home in jackie chan film things get more bizarre when we re introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars including future nypd mavi star david caruso as the speechless card flipping kit kat if that not enough for you there richard grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as deranged couple on the brink of convoluted economic takeover their crotch biting pooch provides couple of the big laughs here wait maybe the only big laughs not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk can even begin to start about the film absurd plot but let not get into that suppose there some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise if they were that desperate but hudson hawk never even has clue of where it going from minute one and from there it 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck
film that means well but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as drama it jeroen krabb melodrama about community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can forget their bitter past the heroine is an attractive carefree nonreligious 20 year old chaja fraser who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations screwing student rebel leader and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother gebrecht and her self absorbed eccentric father schell her parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps and her home life is filled with angst her mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos family album silverware and his old violin he buried them in garden during the war while fleeing the nazis but can locate them now due to all the changes in the city out of frustration after quitting her job as dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment she reluctantly accepts job as nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents apartment building mr apfelschnitt topol tells her about the hasidics are ultra orthodox they don go to the cinema or watch tv adhere to strict dress codes and strictly observe their religious laws chaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules but soon finds the wife mrs kalman rossellini to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her children year old named simcha monty who doesn talk the stern mr kalman krabb is not friendly to her and considers her to be whore because of the way she dresses to hammer home the point of how anti semitism hasn gone away there barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with sneering concierge bradley who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator the film is done in by its ham fisted script as the story adapted from carl friedman book the shovel and the loom goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality it starts off telling chaja story of how she lost jewess trying to find her identity then to her nanny role as she loves mute child stuck in an insulated environment and then it makes it story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can be forgotten the effort seemed heavy handed as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles cartoonish flavoring chaja parents are given no human shades while the janitor villain was particularly annoying role that was one dimensional and falsely acted the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots while rossellini gave warm performance of woman suffering in silence but is strong in accepting her faith topol reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense the film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can love it starts out by showing how under chaja loving care he taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away beginning by saying quack quack and then going on to ask the four questions during passover seder but by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence refuses to speak because of his stern dad and eventually becomes the victim of tragic accident the film thereby exploits the boy sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done felt didn just see movie but attended lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily the message it keeps sending was already received in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past that seems strange since thought that was what this film was supposed to be about unless was mistaken and the film real aim was to make us cry over simcha
the following review contains spoilers please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into film canister again and tries to pass it off as movie chuck dowling the jacksonville film journal wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997 batman and robin apparently no one heard my words oh how wish you had heard them oh how wish someone had stopped him because he done it again the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore surprisingly decent and engrossing tale in fact it was everything that 8mm is not in the opening minutes of 8mm we see private detective tom welles nicolas cage working on case for prestigious member of the government keep this fact in mind cage is trusted with an important case which he solves he returns home to his wife and new daughter and even finds time to rake his yard keep that in mind too it important as well he hired by rich elderly woman to solve mystery after her husband death she comes across film in his private safe it appears to be snuff film sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film hopefully to disprove that it is in fact snuff film so he sets off on journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman lawyer anthony heald an actor who always plays the same type of character that being bad guy when you first see him your first instinct is that he behind the whole thing the choice of casting does the film in then as welles begins his investigation at times we will see shadowy figure following him the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer or someone sent by the lawyer because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet so your first instinct has now been confirmed then when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is part of the whole thing he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced in one of those ridiculous since we re going to kill you anyway why not tell you the whole thing moments but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended huh also when the lawyer reveals himself to be part of the whole thing his main goal is to get the film back so why did he give it up in the first place the lawyer had the film the whole time then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film it totally absurd and this is the screenwriter of seven late in the film there confrontation between all the main characters and after struggle one of the character guns ends up underneath car cage who has been handcuffed to bed is rapidly trying to get to his gun which is on table james gandolfini character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be scene of suspense you see the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he trying to reach it from and so instead of going around the car to the other side where he can easily reach it he just keeps stretching go around to the other side of the car this goes on for minutes then after cage gets his gun gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car boy schumacher is really really getting on my nerves think the final straw would be when cage returns home devastated by everything that he seen on this case and then is no longer able to rake his lawn we actually see shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard other things that bugged me about 8mm one would be the music if you can call it that whenever the score starts up it sounds like techno music and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it awful decision there joel another is cage performance at this point he capable of wide range of performances either good or bad for 8mm he delivers very wooden one and only shines when he interacting with joaquin phoenix who gives great performance as porn shop clerk with heart of altin who helps cage with his case you re capable of much better mr cage now as for you mr schumacher starting to doubt if you re capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema [r]
if only austin powers the spy who shagged me had been just half as original zany silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor it would have easily been one of this summer biggest pleasures if only in fact the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original instead of refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another the filmmakers bombard us with used up tired jokes taken directly from the first one take the scene where austin powers again played by mike myers but with only fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously confronts henchmen on the side of cliff after being pushed off the ravine the bad guy is of course assumed dead but suddenly we hear pleading voice coming from down below he only injured similar scene played very well in the original international man of mystery but here was insulted by it did the filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at rip off apparently overestimated the intelligence of the average movie goer considering that the film has pulled in over $200 million in domestic theatrical grosses alone do hear the sound of franchise heading our way having said that though still cannot deny the film its merits the basic plot was delightfully silly enough to sustain my interest somewhat dr evil mike myers in the second of his three roles having constructed time machine goes back to the year 1969 in an attempt to snatch austin power mojo don you just love that word whilst he is cryogenically frozen when austin gets wind of this after great intro explaining the absence of elizabeth hurley vanessa kensington he too travels back in time to re claim his sexual drive accompanied by the hot to trot felicity shagwell played by heather graham this sounds stupid know but in the movie it starts to make some kind of weird off the wall sense and it worked for me then there mini me verne troyer petite clone of myer dr evil exactly in size troyer persona alone gains the film an extra half star contributing to one particularly hilarious scene where he attempts to nibble on his own mini mr bigglesworth just try to ignore the fact that at he would make dr evil height rise to just over 21 feet no matter however there are only about four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour and half the most notable being the now infamous tent scene and that just isn enough to warrant even minor recommendation if there is in fact an austin powers they should just kill off secret agent powers and put the emphasis on dr evil and mini me unconventional yes but there no denying that it make for better movie
in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french canadian co production by max fischer the movie is set in paris where its hero struggling american author david mirkine judd nelson at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity suffers terrible writers bloc he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle laurence treill unfortunately she hangs out in jet set circles which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous her connection with powerful david caravan pierce brosnan would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller drama would probably be more appropriate genre label pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait long time between any interesting or significant developments low budget also becomes painfully visible and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film unfortunately this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed instead they would have to settle with pointless slow scenes involving nelson brosnan and laurence treill attempts of serious acting all of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone precious time

as hot shot defense attorney kevin lomax keanu reeves has special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients he is also an excellent judge of character knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down potentially damaging witness testimony and on top of that he damn good trial lawyer in the opening scene it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty but it doesn hamper lomax desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt thereby getting an acquittal his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country headed by john milton al pacino he is brought to their headquarters in nyc where he immediately impresses milton and is subsequently offered full time position as head of their newly created criminal law division lomax is soon given the case of his life he must defend real estate tycoon who has been charged with triple homicide the draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell he works late defends the guilty pledges his soul to his firm and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife mary ann charlize theron but what starts off as promising john grisham like story about conscience stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story it begins like typical parable where small town boy makes it big but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money power and greed but milton is far more than just corrupt partner of the firm quite literally he is the devil in disguise and as the movie progresses he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago freaky and frightening things begin to happen and after much of the film has elasped milton horrifying intent is finally revealed the movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts the first involves the comeuppance of lomax as big city trial lawyer the second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax unfortunately the two never mix well into cohesive story and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere granted the film is very handsome looking you ll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during heated speech given by pacino you ll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties you ll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away this was one of the better storylines but unfortunately is only sub plot as with all thing involving the devil you can expect nothing but the worst in the first few scenes reeves anchors the film but then slowly drifts into the background his path from self vanity to self consciousness is never fully explored his actions seem arbitrary and his reasons for them not fully known pacino comical portrayal is spirited but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie there is another plot or two that is introduced but never gets revisited the focus seemed inconsistent throughout and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap this movie tries to be horrifying thrilling and dramatic all at the same time however while the devil advocate strives to get noticed ultimately it makes very little impression at all
capsule gal is 50s ish london cockney gangster who has retired to spain his old associates want him for one last job and send the vicious don to give him an offer he can refuse standout performance by ben kingsley as don cannot save what is essentially set of cliches recycled from old westerns to +4 roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast who would have guessed that the most savage mad dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by ben kingsley my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark henry fonda in once upon time in the west or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it they should know that the way for film to create really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild sympathetic or even ineffectual character roles the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when role calls for him to be fierce and vicious that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast gary gal dove played by ray winstone has retired from london career of crime and is living on luxurious villa in spain life has become routine of sunning himself and relaxing but his paradise is about to be shattered by one two punch the first punch is boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa the second punch comes from gal past back in london gang boss teddy bass ian mcshane tv lovejoy is planning to break into safety deposit room in bank and he wants gal he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ben kingsley to fetch gal don will accept any decision gal makes from yes to certainly however if gal says no don will do whatever it takes to turn it into yes including threatening guy ex porn star wife deedee amanda redman in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody skin kingsley makes don compact package of fury and nastiness there are some serious problems in louis mellis and david scinto script that should have been caught before filming when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success beyond an ability to use skin diving gear no special talents are required of him any local hood could have done what gal is needed for additionally the crime involves digging from swimming pool to the bank vault flooding the vault no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool in spite of the provocative title the story is cliched and overly familiar know have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade the story is usually of the reformed outlaw robert taylor type who has hung up his guns and is trying for life of peaceful respectability the old gang however wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends rabid richard widmark type to go and git im it is not great plot in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards perhaps the film has little more respectability because it was made not as western but as stylish british gangster film it is an old plot dressed up to look new if the plot is old at least the style is creative this is director jonathan glazer first film but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences cinematographer ivan bird uses lot of half lit scenes we see one side of person faces but the other side fades into the darkness sort of metaphor for the half world these characters in habit half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden we yanks will have hard time with some of the dialog at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking the heavy accents and the cockney language sexy beast is very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here still somewhat novel genre the london crime film the plot may be new to british crime films but it would be overly familiar as western further respectability comes from ben kingsley high powered performance give it on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale

robin williams this time without beard returns to drama in this sloppy sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects he plays chris nielsen who meets annie annabella sciora and promptly marries her they have two great kids who sadly die in car crash just when it couldn get any worse chris gets killed in car crash and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert gooding jnr annie can take the grief anymore and kills herself all sounding like good fun so far the penalty for suicide is to go to hell and chris goes on mission to try and rescue her using the help of the traveller max von sydow based on novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson what dreams may come is clunky manufactured material doused with extra load of sugar this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made everything is wrong about this movie the performances are forced and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters williams puts on convincing upset face but that all it is face there no emotion behind it sciora performance is lazy and bogs down the whole film she may look pretty but she can act max von sydow is as the traveller if nothing special cuba gooding jnr thankfully adds some bounce to his performance and is certainly the best performer in the film it shame that his character is so flat and and offers no room for improvement all the performers have to work with soppy script that tries it best to get some emotion going but never takes off the ground there are _some_ scenes which could be real heartwarmers but the faceless characters don help to get anything out of the performers while films like used great actors music and direction to pull of masterful heart tugging scene what dreams may come is haphazard expecting the emotion to come out of the scene automatically instead it all rather boring sure the music is pretty by michael kamen and the cinematography isn bad by eduardo serra but there something lacking the script doesn help filled with hopeless romantic clich and dud speeches richard matheson can write some awesome science fiction stories sadly this novel would look embarrassed in bargain bin let alone being converted into $70 million vehicle for robin williams despite being set in heaven what dreams may come is mightily depressing the film rushes happy ending but everything before this is very very sad and siyah which just adds to make the ending even more hopeless and stupid but there one redeeming feature about this failure of movie the special effects heaven and hell are truly incredible places and the actors fit perfectly with the virtual sets but despite this what dreams may come proves to be nothing but the biggest disappointment of 1998 instead of raising questions about existence it raises boredom sadly recommend you give this film miss better luck next time robin david wilcock review 1998 you know for kids norville barnes
the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer other comic book adaptation batman and robin both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty headed character motivations in panel sized morsels implausible plots and rambo esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork but on thirty foot silver screens it much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons beyaz who is framed by corporate baddie played without irony by sheen then set on fire and left for dead though the movie skimps on the next few plot points here what could determine said assassin then becomes the leader of satan army under the tutelage of flatulating midget named clown leguizamo grating as always he is renamed for reasons unbeknownst spawn and granted really cool costume that enables him to become something of human chameleon but when spawn spies on birthday party for his child he realizes that he can be the evil superdemon he expected to be and he sets about avenging his untimely death typical of summer blockbusters spawn is an effects laden ninety minute rock video while the visions of hell are laughably crude think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man spawn prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion spawn longs for his wife but they don have single scene together before simmons death conflict who will triumph is not anybody guess and believability not that expected it so many questions are left unanswered and sure they won be addressed in the inevitable sequel while last year the crow city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative which was lazy and somewhat incoherent it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power spawn is an in your face screaming banshee of film these guys know how to graft comic book onto celluloid but they haven the faintest idea how to make movie
month ago wrote that speed was the worst film ve ever reviewed on paper didn know at the time that soon encounter and despise batman robin which has just overtaken speed as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer as directed by joel schumacher who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and isn very good at either is one long excuse for taco bell promotion the plot which has mr freeze and poison ivy uma thurman planning to take over gotham city and then the vorld as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust partnership blah blah blah but morals are not the point of this film topping each bloated confusing action scene with next one is the garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls since when did gotham city become giant las vegas hotel only george clooney comes out on top he underplays nicely and pretends like he in real movie
disconnect the phone line don accept the charges do anything you can to avoid the wretched melodramatic sisterhood dramedy `hanging up figured needed to get in touch with my feminine side and `hanging up seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so the film features an incredible palate of female talent and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as `sleepless in seattle and `unsung heroes meg ryan diane keaton and lisa kudrow play trio of sisters who once separated by career judgments over family ties must reunite when their father walter matthau is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer disease while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery `hanging up has the overall effect of tele marketer pestering you for two hours while you don have the option of doing as the title suggests for the first half hour the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for basis of character development this is an annoying and ineffective device cell phones ring every five minutes and everyone hurriedly rushes along leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters issues and problems if `hanging up was an apple pie then felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story granted there are few genuine and sincere moments in the film but they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck the most outrageous strategy in `hanging up is that after series of largely unrealized attempts at character development we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for melodramatic finale we are able to identify with eve ryan the most open and caring daughter because she is the one who stayed by her father side as everyone else moved forward to pursue impending career georgia keaton the eldest daughter is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called `georgia maddy kudrow the soap opera actress spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog ryan convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of `hanging up kudrow so delightfully eccentric as the off kilter airhead phoebe in `friends is totally wasted ditto for keaton who is serving double shift as co star and director time slot that can be difficult priority juggle her frenzy is apparent for chick flick there is distressing lack of chuckles the reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that given his character situation seems more depressing than amusing even so the peak form of humor in `hanging up is represented by some of matthau nasty quips and ryan eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow pill that about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film my curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such promising and star studded approach could turn so viciously sour but really it no mystery the predictable melodramatic filth that is `hanging up is certainly not the fault of these actresses pin it on the screenplay which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations it certainly far cry from what one would label as rewarding experience but `hanging up should have at least been enjoyable uh uh it wrong number from the beginning
as any reasonable human being would must admit that occasionally am befuddled by certain things am befuddled by fight club now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later perhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time perhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate and understand them fight club is either garbage or brilliant but at least right now must lean toward the former maybe am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure altin but if it is sure don see it edward norton plays jack field examiner for major automobile manufacturer his insomnia coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to complete himself make him loser at the game of life but when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window he seeks comfort in stranger tyler pitt whom he met on flight home once jack is sucked into tyler world he can get out literally they begin fight club an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join sense of belonging as the fight club grows things get out of control and take on cult status beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler house for three days dare not even begin to bring up the last quarter of the film since that contains the twist that explains the pointless journey suffice it to say was truly disappointed in fincher who previous two films se7en and the game put him in very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation this is not to imply by any means that he is no longer genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the table but with fight club he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and self referencing film elements such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that slightly altered recurring line is good flashback humor now throughout the film coarsely woven texture and over extended plot lines fight club is obviously trying to make various social comments about the state of the world today advertisements inter office politics corporations you name it it addressed though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced all of them play an important role how so well can kinda just tell can really put my finger on it to say that starbucks and barnes noble are taking over their respective markets and kicking out the small business owner is no big news is that bad for the world probably not much room for social commentary there we all know that inter office politics are just that politics so what was the point of all this the film seems desperate to make point or number of points but couldn figure out what they were all saw was very bizarre social satire that was woven with strange film techniques bleak visual design and some fine acting pitt carter norton all of them are good even meatloaf is good when you get to the end you will most likely be filled with questions many of which the filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself not them because each of them would likely give you different answer fight club means what you want it to mean think fincher just gives you the stuff to think about but it couldn be more bizarre and unappealing sure it had shock value but so did se7en and the game and they were significantly stronger films
the new austin powers film continues movie tradition begun in the eighties produce something anything that will get the high school and junior high kids in the theater because they buy more soda and popcorn than senior citizens the usual hallmarks of this filmmaking tradition are all here gross humor sex jokes silly sight gags more sex jokes and the film is strong contender in the current race to be cruder grosser and more outrageous than that last film what the film is not however is funny the plot centers around the return of dr evil who goes back in time to steal austin powers mojo liquid with kirmizi stuff in it extracted from austin pelvis which gives austin his sexual prowess and the charisma to defeat his enemies austin must go after him and returns to the swinging sixties where free love and sexy secret agents had their heyday almost avoided this film because did not like the original but the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle and the film received many good reviews wish had stuck to my first impression myers is trying to be the jerry lewis of this generation and he has the talent to do it at least as an actor but the material he is working with here much of it his own falls short of anything resembling comic genius this movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about drinking distilled feces five hundred pound fat man butt crack and barrage of sex jokes aimed at the level of the average 15 year old after some of these scenes one has to wonder how gross the next generation of films will have to go to get an audiences attention the direction also helps the film achieve new low point in cinematic humor for the most part felt as if was watching saturday morning chalderns live action tv show there is no sense of comic timing or subtlety the director just throws the material at us giving us nothing except the hope that anyone with camera could be film director am sure the film will have appeal to many of the under 22 crowd at least the one who have yet to discover literacy certainly the movie is directed towards the generation that prefers everything described as in your face kick you in the teeth take no prisoners action verb +blah blah blah if you see the film and you find you re not laughing there is nothing wrong with you it just means you grew up since seventh grade
you know never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man while watching instinct couldn help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well explored themes of those earlier movies even beside the tarzan comparison instinct just isn very good film it painfully idealistic manipulative and silly didn hate it it simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins furthermore most of the acting is quite good but can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct and it pretty clear that this could have been good film with massive script overhaul and director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams things start off in the predictable way as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero theo caulder cuba gooding jr an ambitious young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced old psychiatrist donald sutherland caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life the one he thinks will make him famous the subject is ethan powell hopkins an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa and it now caulder job to find out of he mentally competent enough to stand trial through series of short sessions caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell even though it really is an old man version of tarzan much of this central idea is rather interesting as said hopkins is captivating for every second he on screen he has way of convincing us that he not acting that he actually man who has just spent two years of his life living with family of wild gorillas the character himself isn very interesting he just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action gooding jr does strong work opposite hopkins playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual the screenplay written by gerald di pego and suggested by novel by daniel quinn gives us no background information on caulder but that seems to be the point he has no time for friends because he obsessed with his work nonetheless these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct unfortunately filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct artistic failure for they work together to make the dumbest most cliche ridden environment in which their characters are to live and they do so by means of brainless subplots first we have the prison warden subplot the prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder progress at any cost if this means taking caulder off the powell case then that fine there also the prison guard subplot the prison guard is played by john ashton the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision and he instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion then there the daughter subplot in which maura tierney playing the daughter must look very upset lot of the time after all she is the daughter of deranged man if some of this stuff sounds familiar that because they re all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films the evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo nest had ashton evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown in the shawshank redemption hopkins performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs and then there the whole tarzan thing which is more than little bit obvious through the entire film perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half hearted attempt at philosophical depth the message powell brings back from the wild is not subtle one he thinks that humans are takers that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas can sympathize with that but only when it in compelling film this is the kind of stupid movie just like patch adams in which big group of characters psychotic inmates in this case rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards what does any of this have to do with man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas if all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor we would have had thirty minute movie far superior to the two hour one that watched today if the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise then we would really have had something interesting movie that doesn rely on the strength of its actors
in the finale of disney mighty joe young 15 foot tall 2000 pound gorilla holds frightened young boy in its clutches as it topples from crippled ferris wheel and plummets to the ground upon impact rugged everyman and perennial do gooder bill paxton rushes in containing the emotional crowd with an earnest move along now folks there nothing to see here ok so those aren exactly the words he uses but it probably one of the few clich not uttered in this unnecessary remake of an unnecessary remake of that mother of all monster movies king kong 1949 mighty joe young was an update of that classic creature feature also based on merian cooper original story 16 years after kong it appeared the world was ready for new take on the beauty and the beast fable now some 49 years later at least according to disney way of thinking the world is ready for one more not so the only and mean only reason to see the 1998 version is for the special effects and these unfortunately run hot and cold today joe young is designed and produced by special effects whiz rick baker who has been wowing audiences with his state of the art make up effects since 1971 schlock which incidentally featured baker enhanced gorilla joe is combination of animatronic effects computer graphics and that old standard man in monkey suit while there are occasional flashes of brilliance baker had lot of practice with simian effects after all including gorillas in the mist greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes and the 1976 remake of king kong there also some surprising cheesiness one of the film most embarrassing moments is when paxton band of african trackers first encounter and pursue the larger than life primate in scene unashamedly ripped off from the lost world jurassic park paxton jubilantly extols the beast majestic gait at the same exact moment as joe and the computer effects driving him stutter to halt also if the film producers had wanted us to focus our attentions on the titular ape they shouldn have paraded female lead charlize theron trial error around in seemingly endless wardrobe of spaghetti strapped tops even joe seems distracted at times the film piles on the clich like there no tomorrow including the predictable plot anthro zoologists ship gigantic gorilla to where urban havoc is inevitably wrought predictable villain lithuanian think overheard someplace predictable love story bill and charlize surprise and predictable denouement twas box office receipts that killed the beast kids raised on men in siyah non monkey effects also by baker are going to find ron tremors underwood outing little lame by comparison while certainly better than 1978 king kong lives itself lousy sequel to not particularly good remake mighty joe young proves how the mighty keep falling
woody allen is one of the most successful artist directors in hollywood but he is becoming less and less reliable as filmmaker in his early years of film making he mastered the simple comedy from there he went into second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles some of these work better than others zelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of creative and intelligent artist deconstructing harry goes to the other extreme and is bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back harry block allen has in his life only two drives he wants to have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing the story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with number of often clumsy stylistic experiments perhaps the most irritating device is to express the disjointedness of harry life by editing harry scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out as writer harry puts his friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises the film dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harry books with different actors playing the real and fictional people in harry life these fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes with the real characters it is up to the viewer to keep track not just who is fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of which real person if that sounds complicated it is then as another device in one of the stories an actor seems to have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus and can only be seen in blurry image harry sees this as metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for short time as if these touches did not create sufficient confusion the story is told out of chronological order if allen were giving the audience story that was worth decoding any and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable but allen puts the audience through all of this to give us portrait of harry block who is selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort to understand deconstructing harry is set at time when harry old college the one that expelled him when he attended it wants now to honor him for lifetime of writing achievement harry is searching among his friends to find one who will go with him just why someone who is so unwilling to commit to relationship with anyone suddenly needs the support of someone else is unclear harry tries his current girl friend fay elizabeth shue only to find that she is about to marry harry old friend larry billy crystal block would like his son hilly eric lloyd to accompany him but hilly mother previously first harry psychiatrist and more recently his wife refuses to let her son see his father another friend richard bob balaban would go but has health problems harry also considers bringing prostitute cookie hazel goodman it is interesting that allen should introduce another likable prostitute so soon after mighty aphrodite but cookie is considerably different black and lot brighter than mira sorvino character in the previous film while the comedy sequences are never complete few are elaborate and some quite funny the centerpiece of the film is journey into hell with allen playing sort of orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil who looks lot like larry that story also is left uncompleted perhaps to show harry unwillingness to commit even to telling story the linchpin that was needed to tie together the stylistic quirks of this film was central character who changes and who gives us something about which to care that character is patently not the one allen creates in harry block and not the characters around harry as seen through his acerbic eyes allen can do much better than deconstructing harry rate it on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale
they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movie poster no sequel scary movie is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor and it is not because the wayans brothers shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera don try what defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof the first movie an outrageous low brow savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and know what you did last summer succeeded because of its take no prisoners attitude toward type of film that was in vogue familiar and popular in scary movie the filmmakers take on the haunted house ghost story format which if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series scary movie does start off promising with wonderful spoof of the exorcist featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn of course split pea soup is the punch line an overabundant amount which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive but this pre credit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend weekend at creepy haunted mansion as part of university class project some of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original but they lack that take no prisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque scary movie merely lurches from one lame sendup to another offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with basketball and the films what lies beneath and hannibal features that only faired adequately at the box office john woo mission impossible and charlie angels it is as if the wayans and their team of writers at least seven are credited just threw ideas in blender and hoped they coalesce they don while the pace of the original left you breathless the sequel moves with the speed of an 18 wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up steep mountain road you can almost hear the reels panting scary movie tries very hard to live up to its original but it falls very short it dissatisfying spectacle very weak sister of very good movie the really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is
this review contains spoilers but believe me don say anything you can guess 10 minutes into the movie did go into this one with high expectations had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify departure from the slasher flicks sort of expected another exorcist or the shining even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film boy was wrong another garbage slasher flick the only difference being that this one has story the story you ask well scumball buys chinese puzzle from guy in an arab souk he takes it home somehow getting it past customs and starts fiddling with it in his attic lo and behold after he takes it apart three demons appear and start taking him apart but with meat hooks when they re finished his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling they botch up their cleanup job however and manage to leave his heart or some gland didn really recognize the organ under floorboard the guy brother and his brother wife appear at the door soon after and decide to move in they throw away scumball belongings and set up house turns out that wife is bit of nympho and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage she starts having some wild hallucinations later hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards slow mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground all from the tiny cut on his hand said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball organ the organ grows into thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into really ugly thing it establishes mind contact with wife who agrees to help him get more blood because she really wants to be screwed again so she helps him kill three businessmen scumball at this time gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back problem is he doesn have any skin and even after three or four corpses still doesn get any skin he finally gets some though but strangely enough he ends up looking like his brother guess they couldn get the original actor back who knows scumball whose name is frank is not nice guy he describes his torture by the demons fondly as the ultimate pleasure and pain since at that level there is no difference between the two somehow don see getting torn apart by 90 fish and meat hooks lot of fun this guy is so bad how bad is he so bad that the rats cower in corner in fear for good reason too he crucifies two of them for fun and carves third while the nympho horsing around with hubby anyway hubby daughter who if course is not wife daughter starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams the dumb bimbo meets scumball and is not impressed she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle and brings out the demons at any rate the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup they re normally quite meticulous about that type of thing the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake the demons are not however the good guys the dumb bimbo the good guy she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank but also banishes them to hell or oblivion we re not too sure which not too shabby for someone with single digit iq this is basically bad jinn story it is an awful movie awful acting bad focus in the photography many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks which is really unrealistic and looks like the latex that it is continuity who cares acting terrible script horrible sounds canned unrealistic story is so so but the impact is lost long long before the film ends do think the rat acting was quite good have never seen rats look afraid they should get nominated for an award really good acting there the best in the movie the envelope for best furry rodent please rating would be far too generous 10 rating or in the to +4 rating system is far more accurate this movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show people were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen had to have something to do dumb dumb dumb movie was embarrassed that spent money to see it it goes without saying that disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself lots of slime and red dyed corn syrup does not constitute horror in my opinion
the formula is simple trap varied group of people on an isolated location then pop in seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one these have been the successful ingredients for many good films the thing alien aliens and tremors to name few so why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad see the relic for particularly putrid example perhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient effort and ideas deep rising meets these two requirements part way but not enough to salvage the film treat williams is finnegan the leader of small boat crew who hire out their services and their boat for any activity no questions asked this time however they may have gone too far their passengers led by the ominous wes studi are the type of multi national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films and their cargo let just say it has very high explosive potential what is the target of these thieves why the argonauticus of course high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage but something else is hunting the argonauticus something ancient and deadly by the time the thieves arrive nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed and now the creature senses fresh meat so you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew joining forces with the surviving passengers including the ship owner canton anthony heald and thief with less lofty goals trillian famke janssen against the terror from the deep and the monster gets to pick them off one by one fortunately for the creature this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food if there more clarion call for unity don know what it might be it pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when there are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end for the most part the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first although wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou life bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad treat williams is passable hero and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation but while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way the biggest treat in the film however has to be pantucci kevin connor whining engine boy under finnegan employ his constant quips may be bit over written but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens or todd graff as hippie in the abyss for that matter it just stock part the comic relief character but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable as far as the monster goes although the cgi is done well the creature has no logical consistency think back to the great or even just good movie monsters they all had set of rules about what they could do and how and why they would do it part of the joy of those films was slowly discovering along with the heroes just what those rules are the tentacle monster in deep rising doesn have set of rules or if it does not very good one it merely eats or drinks as the case may be and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place it simply happens the action scenes are decent but few are noteworthy the film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic deep rising peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron but can you really blame them unfortunately deep rising efforts are more on par with speed on the plus side however the film closing image shows some promise for potentially interesting but unlikely sequel perhaps you be better off waiting for that one
the thirteenth floor is bland obligatory exercise in genre film making if hadn recently watched the matrix and open your eyes both of which are similar but far superior might have been little nicer to this picture craig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall the rich co creator of perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss armin mueller stahl everything that was subtle and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one and characters stare at each other for maddeningly long periods of time and refuse to communicate on any realistic level the acting is okay but the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of and features script co penned by director josef rusnak loaded with cliches and stock characters there are individual scenes and ideas that work like the thought of sentient computer program but none of the film strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree producer roland emmerich based on this and his previous directorial efforts seems hell bent on bringing us the ultimate standard in mediocre science fiction
think maybe it time for the batman series to be put to rest not only has the first two films unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into superhero been abandoned but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all out camp with few traces of the self mocking restraint of the relatively light hearted third installment let me give you an example in the first scene of the movie batman george clooney and robin chris donnell are summoned to museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger in an attempt to steal diamond mr freeze thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks but this is no problem for our heroes automatic skates shoot out of their shoes at which point robin manages to get hold of hockey stick grabs the diamond and stick handles it through the museum might have expected this from an airplane style farce but don think that what this movie is supposed to be after all the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superhero action genre and kept the corny death defying stunts to minimum while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony not any more the list goes on and on in this one robin holds onto the outside of flying rocket ship 30 000 feet high in the atmosphere climbing in the door to save batman mr freeze and poison ivy uma thurman leap from skyscraper and survive by landing in small pond world dominating mad scientist lives in fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old he man cartoons my very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl alicia silverstone gets in race with motorcycle thugs during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her not bad but wouldn the police or maybe batman notice if the road was on fire knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place but it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment as if three protagonists and two villains weren enough batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce wayne butler alfred michael gough which might have seemed poignant if it wasn surrounded by so much silliness as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie all this might be semi excusable if the story were interesting and entertaining but it isn in fact it kind of boring mr freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson joker and danny devito penguin their evil plot is as predictable schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words today gotham city tomorrow the world as it is lame brained didn it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too and robin constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bull headed and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as partner in the first place strip away the stars the fancy set design and the status as batman movie and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick
the characters in jonathan lynn the whole nine yards yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies 1999 analyze this and mickey mavi eyes 2000 gun shy are rarely ever written as real people but merely as one dimensional caricatures when an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed it is not to service the character development or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations but to accommodate the convoluted plot in lightweight comedy you might say it is not required to have perfectly realized figures just as long as they get the job done unfortunately for comedy to work it has to at least succeed at being funny and if there was laugh meter available guess that it briefly ascended around 5% of the time for me suffice to say the comedy in the whole nine yards works about as well as the broken down lawnmower in my backyard and when giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes it is by sheer luck nicholas oz oseransky matthew perry is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec trapped in hateful marriage with the conniving sophie rosanna arquette delightfully hamming it up with clearly artificial french canadian accent one day oz sees that someone is moving into the house next door walking over to greet him he is horrified to discover it is jimmy the tulip tudeski bruce willis former contract killer for the mafia who has just been released from prison once getting to know him and becoming his friend oz is more comfortable with his identity but for sophie it means possible hitman to do away with oz in her scheme sophie sends oz to chicago to cash in by informing his old mob boss kevin pollak about jimmy whereabouts but in the process he falls in love with jimmy wife cynthia natasha henstridge who is being held hostage upon return to quebec and with one contrivance after the next oz dental assistant jill amanda peet is overjoyed to discover that he lives beside the tulip and forces him to set up meeting since jill dream in life turns out being contract killer herself have you got all that because there is more much much more and this is movie that without credits is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour the whole nine yards is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty headed excursion into well worn terrain already set by far superior pictures how the cast most of which are respectable actors got caught up in such cliched deficient film remains mystery unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn 1985 comedy classic clue the movie going into the theater preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable but by the twenty minute mark when had chuckled once and laughed nary single time it was clear this production was in serious trouble since the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot and the screenplay inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner collapses with every failing comedy bit the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and frequently entertainment value the whole nine yards is neither facetious nor aside from the subplot about jill shocking eagerness to become professional hitwoman inventive and more often than not just lies there the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector but never igniting any sort of spark few select actors do what they can with the material while others make no impact at all on the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters matthew perry and bruce willis perry innocuously enjoyable on tv friends plays the same exact sitcom style character in all of his movies from 1997 fools rush in to 1999 three to tango and it has become crushing bore meanwhile willis makes next to no impression and because of the limited guise of his jimmy the tulip tudeski oftentimes disappears into the background their three female counterparts fare noticeably better best of all is natasha henstridge far more radiant than in the exploitative species movies who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia henstridge has the talent for sure to break out of these countless throwaway roles but first she must fire her agent amanda peet has lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who thus far has strived on career based solely on comedy it is too bad then that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in climactic scene with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts finally rosanna arquette is awful as sophie but something tells me that was her purpose and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time also popping up is michael clarke duncan fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in the green mile as jimmy largely built friend and fellow killer frankie figs when the whole nine yards eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion one is left pondering how such film ever got greenlit great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past and this one is nothing but duplication of better films so what was the point without passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments the whole nine yards rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast and half of the actors are not charming at all now what does that tell you
so much for sweet returns after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80 slasher movies starting with 1996 scream and followed by scream urban legend and the original know what you did last summer film like still know what you did last summer was bound to be made sooner or late it is perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out and that is because they reached for the lowest common denominator in filmmaking favoring non stop deaths and gore for suspense and trading in fleshed out likable characters for one dimensional nitwits it has been exactly one year since julie james jennifer love hewitt suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road and then thinking he was dead dumped him into the ocean since then julie has relocated to boston university and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams she has been able to put her life back together when julie friend karla brandy is called up by radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is she wins vacation to the bahamas for four people which also includes karla horny boyfriend tyrell mekhi phifer and will matthew settle who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend ray freddie prinze jr also returning from the original doesn show up when they reach the secluded island they discover it is the last day of the open season and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with few employees to fend off violent storm headed for them of course julie her friends and the workers aren the only ones there as the murderous ben willis dressed in fisherman garb returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all it is sad state of affairs when movie like still know what you did last summer is made am very big fan of horror movies and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to ikwydls which am fan of is almost an exact replica of friday the 13th movie while the original focused more on the story and characters as well as genuinely suspenseful moments thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson who didn return to write the sequel and it shows still know has no story to speak of and is so vacuous of ideas that the filmmakers were forced to have murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested also gone are any signs of character development and since every single character died before got to know them all was left with was to stare at the screen indifferent to what was going on while cared about the fates of the characters in the original it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died they were all paper thin and pointless except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman another element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted set pieces like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar but there are none to speak of in this sequel although they do come close at one moment with brandy since so many people were killed every couple minutes the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water also of note is the mystery of the second killer and accomplice to ben but it is obvious from the first frame who it is and so couldn even have fun at that like did in the scream movies and urban legend it figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again film would come along and ruin it for everyone else maybe the people who made still know what you did last summer should have realized that in order to make good movie you must have screenplay or at least one that isn such siyah hole for thoughts and ideas the ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for third part but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead
so went and saw this film right it was called battlefield earth was never interested in the previews and never too terribly interested in the book nor do find scientology interesting but after reading advanced reviews of how bad this film really is had that weird urge just to watch it well let me be the first to say and so far in my view it safe to say battlefield earth might be the worst film have ever seen yes even worse than mr magoo mavi in the face or jaws the revenge roger christianson whos credits include set direction and art direction for such great films as alien and star wars directs this film with such amateurism that the film looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb that it quite depressing the look of the film is dark and drabby at times but then bright and happy at other times the sound is terrible and has the worst surround sound effects ve heard the acting is nothing the dialogue poor and the make up effects hideous here the so called plot earth 3000 man is endangered species while aliens from the planet psychlo the aliens are named psychlo wonder why are invading earth destined to put an end to those man animals to an end and destroy earth once and for all of course we have our typical hero played terrible by barry pepper who was great in small role in 1999 the green mile who is destined to go out and save his planet one thing he has to go up against terl the chief of security psychlo who is played frankly quite bad by john travolta whom with dreadlocks big head and green eyes just doesn work of course the sidekick to terl is played by lol forest whitaker who looks like deformed werewolf of some kind our friendly human johnny barry pepper looks just as bad as well with long scraggly hair not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film except just to say it terrible everything in this film is imcomprehinsable from the make up effects which by the way aren good to the phony looking special effects everything in this film is faulted in fact don remember one part in this entire movie where was having good time or enjoying myself in fact there is no part in the movie that liked or enjoyed throughout the entire 127 minute running time was dying constantly looking at my watch and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow bulb or something sadly it didn my advice to hollywood get new scripts new acting classes better directors and damnit make films like american beauty more
feel sorry for the financial backers of waterworld which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made at $172 million and is also one of the stupidest boy did they get ripped off in fact this film is not really movie but more of an amusement park ride with plot it not even just another case of cliches strung together well it is that too it something that painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws kevin costner stars as man who is some kind of mutant half man half fish he is an explorer mariner on an alternate earth that is completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted he referred to as the mariner but they the meaner would have been more appropriate title because he cold rigid and strict and he supposed the be the good guy he docks at small floating village of sorts he trades dirt for money and this introduces us to the other important characters first we meet one of the villains then the soon to be heroine child prodigy wacky inventor and group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today but also some of the low tech tools used by pirates and vikings immediately the film biggest flaw is apparent are these people primitive or highly advanced it doesn seem like anyone can read yet they have ski doos and airplanes how are these things powered and if they have airplanes couldn they just keep flying until they reached dry land also if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials to make these things sorry all for checking your brain at the door when going to the movies but elements like these cannot go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story and confuse us there was potential here for good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology so why mix the two together it doesn make any sense there really isn much of plot here because the story moves so quickly it never takes time to explain anything the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child enola mojorino has tattoo on her back that is supposedly map to dryland who put the tattoo there and how come it has taken them this long to figure this out we never get an answer just stupid action movie about whoever can get the girl will be the victor of sorts if they reach dryland to make long boring stupid and just plain bad story short the mariner escapes with woman named helen tripplehorn and enola they sail for long time encountering some strange people in the process and fight off the smokers as lead by the idiot villain deacon hopper who kidnaps enola the story becomes overly grand adventure with the mariner taking on an army of goons rescuing enola and bringing them all to salvation how original even with all its special effects action and adventure this film is boring not single character is likable therefore neither is the plot dennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholson joker while costner just plain rips still waterworld is professionally made with good production design and an original idea but no substance to it just hope they don make sequel
be gentle urges natasha henstridge to matthew perry in the whole nine yards haven made love in five years neither have rebuts perry married if jonathan lynn latest comedy relied simply on jokes of that caliber and it certainly tries then it be an innocuous if rather obvious little film instead its failings go much deeper first off who hasn had enough of the tough wiseguy intimidates the timid wise guy genre if you want to make pretty penny or two in hollywood nowadays simply write comedy which pairs robert de niro james caan bruce willis type with billy crystal hugh grant matthew perry type and wait for the royalties to roll in who next jack nicholson and martin short it certainly doesn have to be funny the whole nine yards is not particularly funny film but it is borderline offensive offensive in the way it continues trend of poking fun at career criminals who wouldn think twice about pushing your mother in law off the brooklyn bridge with her feet encased in concrete that might sound like funny sight gag but the problem is these films have long since lost sight of the fact that taking human life isn all that funny to begin with when the corpse is placed in car doused with gasoline set ablaze and referred to as barbecue it makes you wonder when all this playing killing for laughs is going to end the whole nine yards is also offensive in so much as its three central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects rosanna arquette plays slutty chain smoking french canadian who married to matthew perry none too successful dentist it an unflattering role made all the more so by the unflattering outfits and unflattering situations into which arquette is thrust then there natasha henstridge species and ii who plays the well to do wife of contract killer bruce willis she gets involved with perry character when he comes to chicago hoping to negotiate finder fee with mob boss yanni gogolack kevin pollack transposing his vs with his ws after willis jimmy the tulip tudeski moves in next door henstridge and perry characters hitting it off is about as likely as bruce and demi getting back together perry might have the charm but he doesn have the physical attributes of traditional leading man especially in close up most objectified of the bunch is amanda peet who turns in sexually ripe performance as perry dental assistant with it transpires questionable career goals peet gratuitous nude scene proves how low this movie will stoop to keep its audience from dropping off when my cousin vinny is the highpoint of directorial career including such forgettable films as clue greedy and sgt bilko you have to wonder if lynn chose the wrong career path perry pratfalling goofiness coupled with willis likable hardness could have had some potential but with no script to work with and director who seems to be watching from the wings their characters run out of gas quickly
synopsis sullen julie james still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from know what you did last summer perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins trip for four to the bahamas arriving at the start of the hurricane season julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they ve walked into trap set by the rainslickered slasher with huge hook for hand comments may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here but have never seen an episode of the fox tv series party of five am only vaguely aware of the show premise and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials half paid attention to while watching the tube party of five do know however seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre neve campbell scream queen of the 90s and star of scream scream and the craft is regular of the show so too is jennifer love hewitt lo and behold following in the footsteps of campbell hewitt now has horror franchise of her own the know what you did last summer line though the original film released last year was watchable enough this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater glowing kirmizi exit sign longingly throughout jennifer love hewitt is very good looking young leading lady however unlike neve campbell hewitt struggles with acting she just isn convincing in this film and she wasn in the original either this puts many young males including myself in paradoxical quandary she very attractive but the annoying spoiled valley girl type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize exploitatively her figure add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy another rising teen tv star and you get one frustrated male audience ve spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for reason still know what you did last summer though cashing in on the success of the original ultimately serves as vehicle for these two young actresses nothing else here is original or interesting this movie in fact makes other recent so so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter vampires seem like stunning works of high art still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches an isolated location storm parentless teenagers false alarm nightmares lots of blue lighted darkness scenes garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere etc you get the picture the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer hook they may as well have huge targets painted on them like scream and its numerous knockoffs these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief unfortunately still know characters aren all that funny in particular one character chain weed smoking guy is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn die soon enough the death scenes by the way are relatively violent for theatrically released horror film several of them are uncomfortable to watch and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser bloodline truly sadistic movie this too did not help the supposed humor still know was shooting for and what is the deal with the slasher himself know that the slasher film is not particularly intelligent genre but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror come on the guy looks like the gorton fisherman and his gruff voice makes him sound like disney pirate though his lightning lit appearances ellicited much needed laughter in the theater his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film and that really saying something so all that left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy both prance about in tightfitting revealing outfits or in various states of undress yet neither of them ever actually do nude scene hewitt however does do post shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite titillating this scene alone made this one star turkey earn two stars under my rating system otherwise hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves early in the film for instance brandy wins the trip to the bahamas she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever needed extra strength tylenol after that part oh and the film conclusion talk about repetitive people who saw know what you did last summer will predict still know ending at least minutes before it happens boring saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater admission is only one dollar on wednesdays and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them it usually fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience who don seem to mind participating in mass mystery science theater 3000 type viewing still know what you did last summer however produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience underscoring how bad it really is if it weren for the main actresses revealing wardrobes have had very very hard time sitting through this lame sequel can imagine trying to watch it on video horror films seem 10 times better in theater because they rely heavily on audience participation and wouldn recommend it to people unless they re horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy read on website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works what depressing thought hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act rated this film contains lots of violence several gory scenes and couple nubile horny teenagers though the sex act itself is always thwarted say this is unsuitable for kids but teens wouldn have problem sitting through it especially since they obviously compose the film target audience
my son and share perverse predilection for bad movies we are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills the corny dialog the ludicrous premises and the bad acting since other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together can remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of clunker until species came along he was not amused on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained perhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing insulting my intelligence and brought adequate movie making skills to the project movie does not have to be good to be well made at least in terms of the craft the movie could have been better if it were not so brusque this movie slaps you with conception pregnancy delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames without pausing for infancy the producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in which woman womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm and few seconds later young child tears its way out of her abdomen in sloppy and gory version of an inside out cesarean an autopsy scene in which buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that condone to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect in real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp it is used only after the skull has been exposed the opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good the writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for subtitle `as bad as it gets as the movie progressed vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck eve natasha henstridge was cloned from sil the original alien sexual predator but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated which was all that was needed to turn her into noble and cooperative prisoner in wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer marg helgenberger `i think of all the places that will never see and all the people that will never meet it enough to melt the most callous heart at another point she protests `i human too you know she is only half right peter medak the director knows his business justin lazard as the doomed astronaut does nothing to enhance his hollywood credentials james cromwell his father is perfect in short role marg heldenberger the dna scientist is pleasant and beautiful natasha is an exquisite ornament george dzunza knew and delivered what was expected of him as the dumb general that messes things up michael madsen was there black buddies do not usually survive in this type of movie but mykelti williamson manages to stay around for the final credits which is more that we can say for lazard
what hath kevin williamson wrought while the horror movie revival spurred on by his _scream_ has yielded few decent entries in the genre _i_know_what_you_did_last_summer_ _halloween _h20_ and _scream_2_ it must be noted that williamson himself had hand in the writing of those films those williamson less post _scream_ efforts among them _wishmaster_ and the recent _disturbing_behavior_ have been frightening all right frighteningly insultingly _bad_ add to that list _urban_legend_ which takes promising premise and runs it through predictable meat grinder of idiocy the influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio horta is clear in two key areas first the opening sequence like that of _scream_ is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling this sequence in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini natasha gregson wagner is decapitated while driving also reveals the other obviously williamson esque touch the killer look dressed in large hooded parka wielding an axe the killer bears more than passing resemblance to the _i_know _fisherman sans the hook one thing horta does not borrow from williamson however is the intriguing premise students at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legends those contemporary bits of mythology passed from person to person group to group year to year that become so embedded in the social consciousness it hardly matters if they are true or not such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi he didn michelle slain by the killer lurking in the backseat of lore is but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true as the body count rises fellow pendleton student natalie alicia witt suspects not only link between the murders but personal link to her past as well the setup shows promise but the story never takes off due in large part to horta and the director the aptly named jamie blanks who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares too many of the would be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues and the film chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that _scream_ tried to subvert like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they should and could run out the front door but that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches there also the climactic villain confession in which contrived and way too convenient motive is revealed not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick which is cliche in any film genre banks and horta intentional attempts at humor are also lame the fact that the best gags are lazy in jokey references to the other credits of co stars joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says lot about the imagination of their humor some laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed but not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so the filmmakers don get much help from their onscreen talent was far from fan of bland _i_know starlet jennifer love hewitt but talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic witt whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laughter witt has pefect foil in her equally pesence challenged leading man jared leto _dawson s_creek_ star jackson mugs his way thorugh glorified cameo gayheart displays all the depth and range of well noxzema spokeswoman and robert englund lends the film little more than his freddy krueger pedigree as folklore professor granted the cast is hampered by their material loretta devine who has done some fine work in films such as _waiting_to_exhale_ is saddled with the ridiculous role of pam grier worshiping campus security guard the recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one man namely kevin williamson to stay alive if other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as _urban_legend_ the genre looks to once again go the way of screen slashers many victims
when pair of films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart it could mean one of two things that the recently overworked individual is due for well deserved rest or that either of these movies has been sitting in studio safe for while and the timing is merely coincidence the latter the case with john mctiernan and the thirteenth warrior which finally hits theatres year and counting after its original spring 98 opening and fast on the heels of mctiernan the thomas crown affair remake flick that got good reviews you don have to believe superstitions to wager guess that thirteenth won be so lucky reportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan and producer michael crichton whose eaters of the dead novel provides warrior source and its initial title this messy melange of culture clash drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish sorta like braveheart without any of the passion but the bloodshed certainly remains there enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in search of purely visceral thrills though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness these circa 10th century clashes involve roving band of cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside the good guys are loud crude often unintelligible and judging from their highly icky hygiene habits pretty smelly to boot which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador antonio banderas who tags along quite reluctantly they re also so hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when few of them meet violent demises you ll wince you ll groan you ll grouse haven we seen this guy killed twice before banderas stands confused amidst the chaos partaking mostly from distance as savages in darth maul facepaint and draped in the latest animal skin fashion run amok he not the hero his soulful eyes and lean build don exactly herald champion of shwarzenegger proportions and the thirteenth warrior wisely doesn pretend he is allowing his foreign and physically imposing co stars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough let the characters interaction sans swords and shields however and there still struggle for the audience to follow or even care about the story it isn the end until audiences have witnessed half baked romance murky political intrigue veteran actor omar sharif funny girl dropping by in cameo role and climactic indiana jones and the temple of doom esque chase through the villains underground lair all this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of cinematographer peter menzies jr but the collaboration between die hard helmer mctiernan and jurrasic park creator crichton should have yielded more than sumptuous sights graphic action and unintentionally telling moments heard during the thirteenth warrior final scene dog whimpering how appropriate
who knew that in 16 years eddie murphy who made such brash raucous big screen splash in _48_hrs would become cuddly the disconcerting trend begun in this summer cutesy largely laugh free _doctor_dolittle_ continues with this earnest to fault dramedy although he is top billed here murphy is merely support for jeff goldblum who plays ricky hayman the programming director at home shopping network sales are way down and ricky job hangs by thread until he meets murphy mysterious spiritual guru whom desperate ricky puts on the air while sales skyrocket and becomes an overnight sensation the reinvigorated ricky greed grows endangering his budding romance with goodhearted media research consultant kelly preston writer tom schulman has some promising ideas satirizing home shopping and infomercials and the nature of instant celebrity but these ideas would have more bite if stephen herek had invested any energy into the direction of the film the sluggishly paced _holy_man_ is not only slow and overlong 113 minutes but an unfunny bore and murphy can do little to juice up the proceedings cleansed of both the attitude _and_ comic sensibility that made him star is for the most part straight man he is curiously lifeless presence goldblum is actually quite good but it hard for the audience to sustain much interest in his character and spiritual journey when the director doesn seem to be much interested either
this is the movie that could single handedly bring mystery science theater 3000 out of cancellation it one of those movies that so bad it absolutely hilarious due in no small part to its big star supermodel cindy crawford if you only remember one thing about fair game it should be that it singlehandedly proves crawford should stick to the sports illustrated swimsuit issues if you thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from you ll change your mind when you see fair game ireland would win handfuls of oscars if this was her only competition in real casting coup crawford plays super intelligent lawyer in jogging bra of course we all know this is stretch the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears beyaz after labor day nonetheless someone out there thought she make good lawyer but we re reminded of her true function in the movie when she takes two showers in period of twenty minutes and for you horny teenage boys out there you actually get to see her topless for two seconds in the dark come to think of it that may have been body double cindy crawford isn siyah is she like said crawford is lawyer with bunch of russians after her billy baldwin or is it stephen alec adam kim basinger is the police detective who has to save her life time after time chase after chase explosion after explosion there absolutely nothing original about this movie it every cop show of the 70 mixed with every action thriller of the 80 and every technology exploitation movie of the 90 three decades of crap all in one place driven further into the ground by crawford complete lack of acting talent and it all completely predictable you know the mistakes baldwin and crawford are going to make before they make them you know when the sexual tension will finally end up in them consummating the relationship you know when the villains will capture crawford so baldwin has to rescue her in the climax and you know the movie going to suck from the first scene the plot isn really explained until the end all we know is these russians have every detail about crawford in their computer in the words of one of the villains we even know what size pantyhose she wears yeah you and every 14 year old boy in america he goes on to add we know more about her than she does _that_ find very easy to believe hope you enjoyed those two sample dialogue quotes because wrote down plenty of other bad ones if it weren for me you still be pulling bananas out of your ass in cuba because you see fair game is not only showcase for recycled action cliches and terrible acting but also some seriously bad dialogue it all adds up to really terrible movie that made me laugh in plenty of places wasn supposed to and grimace in places was supposed to laugh one more thing fair game has against it is some awful comic relief would you laugh at scene where crawford tortures computer nerd with double entendres like very interested in _hard_ware and other crap about playing with his joystick wouldn but not because computer nerd it just not funny crawford only contribution to the information age are few gif files floating around with her head on nude traci lords body or was it jack lord body ll leave you with the final line of dialogue in the movie the boat with all the russians has just blown up and baldwin and crawford are floating on life raft crawford says woodenly that was my client boat you just blew up filing lawsuit against you you re in big trouble or something to that effect and baldwin replies smugly what do have to do to get out of it they of course begin making out and the credits roll not going to talk about how stupid the line is or how if they really wanted to go for bad closing line they would have had baldwin say you think could settle out of court but will tell you that if anyone ever suggests you watch fair game with him or her you quote the final line of the movie to that person what do have to do to get out of it serving america for over 50th of century
starring arnold schwarzenegger danny devito emma thompson frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is disappointment and big one at that junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins so foolish me was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins so much for hopes schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists doctors hesse and arbogast who are working on new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy unfortunately due to circumstances beyond their control they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans and subsequently lose their funding still believing that their drug will work they decide to test it anyway on hesse so dr hesse schwarzenegger artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug their theory is that if the drug can prevent man from miscarrying surely it will work on woman does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you well it must have to the producers of junior admittedly schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny but it wasn schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy and the accompanying emotional swings is not funny schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics kept thinking to myself with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture better yet with schwarzenegger devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time why didn they make sequel to twins anything would have been better than this mess danny devito is wasted in this movie his part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street after seeing the movie if was devito probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street emma thompson is wasted here as well while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations she is also fine comedian too bad she didn get to use any of that talent here am being too hard on this film don think so schwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood with supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make bad film they certainly managed here maybe it was well intentioned but unfortunately this is movie that never should have been made if you are tempted to see this film do yourself favor and go rent twins film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito comedic talents
can see decent sports movie struggling to break free of oliver stone `any given sunday it an entertaining movie that offers both insight and excitement into the rock em sock em profession of pro football unfortunately the director seems to have only one priority on his mind sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers in altering each frame with quick flash photography and dizzying in your face editing stone appears to have completely ignored the matter of plausible character development and football politics we see glimpses of greatness but `any given sunday has its agenda all tangled in technical gobbledy gook it grows tiresome and monotonous yes stone has pulled brian depalma matters of importance are pushed aside right from the get go tony amato al pacino coach of the struggling miami sharks finds his team stuck in losing rut aging quarterback cap rooney dennis quaid appears to be losing his touch and amato can seem to ignite any passion in his squad when cap is injured on the field and after patch of unlikely events occur third string qb willie beaman jamie foxx is brought into the game once in the huddle and this becomes an in game ritual beaman horks all over the field nerves you see eventually though the ancy youngster wins the game for his teammates sparking his rise to fame in the football world the endorsements the music videos etc and stone straps us in for the jolting ride of behind the scenes stress and fury that the business is apparently like and believe it there is some intriguing insight posed but in the big scheme of things stone fumbles the ball the problem with the director visual approach is this he uses extravagant editing devices when more conventional approach would have been appropriate football is an exciting game to watch but stone seems to think dizzying the audience with an assault on the senses will only add to the adrenaline rush guess he is mistaken `any given sunday is visual kaleidoscope that leaves the audience in frustrated stupor more frequently than it excites them many football fans including one attended with are liable to be disappointed with the `ultra stylish way stone has decided to present the game in return three star film becomes unfortunately degraded due to the director tampering in welcome scenes when the visual pummeling comes to break this actually shows decent character development and interaction for instance heated returns between amato and feisty young owner christina pagniacci cameron diaz are enjoyable to watch there is also solid performance from jamie foxx who experiments with great success in his first trek into dramatic territory the stellar supporting cast includes matthew modine aaron eckhart lauren holly ann margret and charlton heston in an extraordinarily brief appearance unfortunately too many big names are wasted typical demise for film with such large and experienced cast pacino makes some interesting progress with his character you begin to identify with coach amato and the morals he is striving for but often felt he was just another play thing stone could weave in and out of his editing dynamics `any given sunday is watchable but disappointing sports film in which plot and characters take back seat to excessive filmmaking technique and very distant back seat at that
hav plenty as we are told in the beginning and reminded during the film is true story life itself is series of true stories but most are not movie material as scripted directed and acted by cinematic newcomer christopher scott cherot hav plenty limps along at best its dialog is so stilted you know what they say no women no cry that the actors are content to read the screenplay rather than invest much energy in trying to act it in the story lee plenty cherot is 28 year old author and teaching assistant the movie which happens mainly over the new year holiday consists of series of incidents in which various single and married women try to kiss lee or take him to bed since he consistently refuses caroline gooden tammi katherine jones figures that he must be gay eventually he and havilland hav savage chenoa maxwell get together proving that he wasn gay after all just picky sexy women can sit on his lap and ask him to go to bed with them but he will not even kiss them he man who knows his mind which he frequently shares directly with the audience in series of trite and overly cute monologues filled with wealthy african americans the story is closest in tone to love jones which was better hav plenty story doesn go anywhere at the end it subjects us to lee plenty new film which is movie of the movie we ve just seen but with even worse acting remember folks that as outrageous as this all seems this is true story hav tells the camera but the problem is that it not outrageous at all or even the least bit interesting hav plenty isn so much bad film as it is total waste of the audience time hav plenty runs 32 it is rated for profanity and would be fine for most teenagers
david spade has snide sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom just shoot me it also served as good showcase for him when he co starred opposite the late chris farley in tommy boy and siyah sheep lost and found marks the comedian first attempt at going solo in movie and it also reveals that when spade doesn have reliable back up system his brand of humor seems more desperate than one may expect david spade is not the problem with lost and found he plays dylan ramsey the sweet main character to the best of his abilities the story revolves around dylan obsessions with his beautiful new neighbour lila dubois sophie marceau from braveheart and her terrier named jack dylan believes that the best way to woman heart is through her dog and so he kidnaps jack planning to stage fake rescue in hope to win lila over there are three good things about lost and found the first is spade the second is sophie marceau lovely actress who been planted into the wrong movie lastly there the dog who is used here in similar context to puffy from there something about mary unfortunately director jeff pollack finds more humor in putting jack through cycle in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute this kind of physical humor is dead pollack does everything but beat the poor pooch with baseball bat to get laughs and this procedure is cheap unfunny and resoundingly cruel this is where start to get fuzzy also in this unusual blend is apparently sweet natured love story between dylan and lila given the mean spirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for found this hard to swallow and why does dylan even deserve someone like lila after kidnapping her precious dog and putting it through such pain predictably lost and found opts for happy ending one that feels so sentimental gooey and rings so false that it sets off siren in your head that makes you feel bit cheated david spade who also co wrote the movie tries hard so very hard to make this project amusing there are some choice scenes that are quite funny but the movie is only sporadically funny patrick bruel plays the stock character of rene the pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over with his good looks and money jon lovitz and martin sheen are welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles despite few positive attributes lost and found just doesn work if you re searching for an enjoyable romantic comedy you could do far better than this obvious misguided failure that shows blatant disregard for what it trying to present
its pathetic attempt at improving on shakespeare classic its just another piece of teen fluff kids in high school are not that witty the wittiness is not witty enough the comedy is not funny the acting is poor the music the poster its worse than she all that 10=a classic 9=borderline classic 8=excellent 7=good 6=better than average 5=average 4=disappointing 3=poor 2=awful 1=a crap classic
mission to mars is one of those annoying movies where in the middle of the movie you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movie all five minutes of it mission does give you payoff but when it does come it too little too late mission has some good ideas but they get lost in the unbearably boring delivery dime dozen dialogue and spate of good actors wasted in cardboard cutout roles sure the director and writers were very proud of each hallmark moment they came up with so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until it loses all its charm glances don communicate any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end the film spends an hour on this kind of stuff building to its climax lot of it is cliched glorification of family relationships marriage friendship unite we stand divided we fall kind of crap there are some spectacular special effects sequences in this film and give it points for trying to stay true to the science know trying is the key word here the sequence with the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful and touching but as mentioned by then we re so sick of the goddamn thing we want the movie to be over great design good intentions but no cigar if you re not die hard sci fi fx or jerry connell fan his character is the only one who has some semblance of character don waste your eight bucks on this and what the hell tim robbins died halfway through the movie in stupid way too that just unforgiveable
remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage pulp fiction and fargo both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture and not surprisingly slew of rip offs followed in the years thereafter that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing the way of the gun that at first glance looks like another of those wanna be but upon closer inspection doesn look like anything comprehendable it crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has claustrophobic atmosphere film that won allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous complexity should come as no surprise to anyone who familiar with mcquarrie he wrote the usual suspects which has become cult favorite despite little critical acclaim that film had great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that if it really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating with the way of the gun mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea but this time the story is far less commercial shame because maybe that would have helped the film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely reason to live but aren hell bent on death either played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro they get lucky when they hear about scheme between big shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have baby through in vitro fertilization they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother played by juliette lewis and get nice ransom along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec his wife their hired goons and the bag man played by james caan the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he doing the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can call the authorities for help his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers trail and each make different offers to get the mother back the exec son is doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double crosses secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all mcquarrie doesn know the meaning of the word simple he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making good movie everything has to be complicated and confusing so much so that it to the point of surrealism nothing is what it seems in this reality it one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry rules and regulations every scene with caan character exemplifies this perfectly the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him getting into conversations about the business and how it works and we re hardly given clue as to what they re talking about these characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they re more like ideas ripped off from sketches found in david mamet trash no one here really acts like real person and the story is even further removed from reality it like dream without any appeal take the opening scene for example the phillipe and del toro characters are in parking lot across the street from bar or club counting their money and stuff they sit on brand new mercedes and the car alarm goes off the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don move the guy and his loud mouth potty mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them you think phillipe and del toro are going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by mob there lot of things didn understand about this scene first of all the owner of the mercedes isn some yuppie or old rich snob he like hippie straight out of the 60s secondly the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed lastly it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than small country army if they were suicidal they wouldn have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place and where they get all those guns is never explained either there lot more could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility what it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable and it all coated with thin layer of siyah comedy which is good for chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not flat out siyah comedy and its use of such seems like desperate attempt to kill screen time with any film you see whether you like it or not you can at least understand what the appeal was to it why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it can say either for the way of the gun because it has very little going for it and can imagine anyone intelligently defending it
_dirty_work_ has premise of deliciously mean spirited potential mitch weaver norm macdonald and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna artie lange are losers in life they were constantly picked on in school and now they cannot hold regular jobs but as the trailer goes there is one thing mitch weaver is good at revenge so he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting even schemes into marketable revenge for hire business called dirty work inc this should be the groundwork for wonderfully wicked siyah comedy but for film called _dirty_work_ what ensues is rather clean of spirit in fact what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not giddy desire to give bullies taste of their own medicine but rather more sappy reason sam father jack warden needs heart transplant and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list his compulsively betting doctor chevy chase asks the guys for $50 000 to pay off his bookie so for all the scheming that goes on beneath every underhanded plot is gasp heart which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise not that there isn lot of nastiness on display there is but of different sort there are frequent sexual references most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam impotent father ongoing lust for them and for film rated pg 13 director bob saget yes that bob saget of _full_house_ and _america s_funniest_home_videos_ fame and writers frank sebastiano fred wolf and macdonald himself stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far arguably bit too much so was not one but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary but the issue of course is not so much of taste as it is humor as in is it funny or not the answer is resounding no it not that macdonald isn funny guy he was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much talked about firing and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen it also doesn hurt that he natural likable screen presence he is able to give some of his lines nice acid touch but for the most part the oneliners as written are flat and the broad slapstick gags just don work one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings real riot still macdonald few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has the late chris farley as hysterical as he ever was is amusing in cameo role but as whole the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance saget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman adam sandler and john goodman but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81 minute running time the film closes on sad note of desperation an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement come to think of it cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_
there good and timely story trapped deep within the excess of murder in the first new movie about the abuses of our prison system with country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy this expose would offer something rare to recent american movies point of view but director marc rocco makes it clear from the beginning that pretentious often nauseating camera movements and slick mtv style lighting and editing are far more important there not moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling and everything suffers christian slater and kevin bacon star as defense attorney and alcatraz inmate respectively after spending an unprecedented amount of time in an isolated cell for attempting to escape bacon murders another prisoner and faces trial his young lawyer slater is fresh out of law school but determined to put alcatraz on trial for the abuses of it warden gary oldman the result is the usual courtroom theatrics imagine stanley kramer production shot by hyperactive film school students there very little to praise here outside of kevin bacon earnest overacting and the appropriate story there lot of overacting from everyone you know you re in trouble right away when lee ermey the drill sergeant in full metal jacket is cast as judge the center of reason and moderation slater has never been convincing and certainly isn here and oldman is on bad streak of hammy performances but the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling good story there are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not even moving near the characters let alone with them how frustrating it must be for actors to work under these conditions if there anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of the world it is our ability to tell good story have we forgotten
wonderland is rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as ton of bricks falling on you you can see its plot developing from mile away you are lured into its benign story of single 29 year old girl looking for soul mate in boston as that city is depicted as mini wonderland for singles this is star oriented film and the star who carries the film is erin hope davis that this is dating film about singles who for reasons of fate or luck or whatnot have not had successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers is nothing new this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films the fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of sense of urgency than this film the main quirk in the plot here is that hope pushy mother hollan visits her in boston sees her daughter live in relationship with radical protester hoffman breakup and decides to put personal ad in the newspaper for her harvard medical school drop out daughter who works as nurse this is done without her knowledge it is cornball sitcom stuff but at least it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director it is easy to like erin she is bright caring and attractively blonde it is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with the financially strapped ruggedly handsome intelligent 35 year old alan alan who no longer wants to work with his father as plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending college to be marine biologist of course he comes across as being so good though he does kill some fish in the aquarium that it is hard to believe he for real or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for the contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as the subway at restaurant or on the phone alan brother answers erin ad with few of his pals as they each try to respond to her ad in phony way making bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her that the others witness will win the bet this sub plot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told that we have to see erin go through several dates to prove the point how ego sick these guys are each one more annoying than the other culminating in the most obnoxious one of all that brazilian lover jose who is about as charming as snake oil salesman who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for holiday in brazil was not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of the story anyway as expected all well that ends well for this watchable piece of fluff that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its story line the dialogue was actually not bad those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation and oh by the way wonderland refers to the stop on the boston metro it is where greyhound racing takes place
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned it rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor first feature film dream with the fishes when the plodding tedious opening sequence finally pays off with potentially provocative setup any hopeful expectations however are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film latter half the film central characters are terry david arquette depressed lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident and nick brad hunt carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill nick lives in the apartment building across from terry who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz kathryn erbe with his trusty set of binoculars but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where half drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge unconvincingly vowing suicide nick casually asks for terry wristwatch and eventually cons terry into trade the watch for bottle of pills of course terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch learning of nick condition he only has handful of weeks left terry compassion kicks in and the two eventually come to distinctly peculiar arrangement terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick lifelong fantasies and nick will fulfill terry death wish by killing him this is promising premise and mr taylor film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters terry is repessed mournful character who wants to die while nick is free spirit with joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into typical lark where the two characters engage in series of generally dull exploits and where the straight laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with quirky character this is by the numbers plotting buddy movie road movie redux however dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline but by the characters which carry the story it helps in such film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic if not likeable unfortunately that is not the case here where both of the film leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits far from romp this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like chore to endure than playful jaunt and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond mr taylor dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes while attempting to capture quirky and clever tone it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived witness such lines as you should have asked something more interesting like do you enjoy the pain see that provocative leaves room for further questions the film enjoys few inspired moments the urn scene session of nude bowling the policeman joining in on terry and nick acid trip but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes this occurs particularly often during the film opening sequence as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital realising that this is intended to be funny although nary smile crept upon my lips which is probably due to the obvious fact that it painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick scheme of tricking him this is not film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes the entire sequence is then clearly an exercise for character exposition with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability among the cast coming off best is david arquette the current master in the portrayal of meek squirming stammering fresh faced characters he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang swimming with sharks who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry mr taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated as opposed to bright crisp look for the smalltown scenes the charge of dream with the fishes protagonists being wholly unempathetic is bit of an odd one coming from me seem to have predilection for films with unlikeable characters and indeed in many cases have been in the minority supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult audience unfriendly nature of their characters for dream with the fishes though did find myself on the flip side of coin often hoping that the film would quickly conclude and that the nick character would just hurry up and die
die hard is an altogether unfortunate fiasco inferior to the original in every respect place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson who wrote the film pathetic screenplay every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor the plot is altogether implausible the convoluted story line involves band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower leaving dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land the film has zero credibility and all of the characters come off as cliched cardboard cut outs so much for the script how about the action well let put it this way director renny harlin could learn few things from john mctiernan who directed the original as well as the hunt for kirmizi october and predator all standouts for their hair raising suspense by contrast harlin doesn have clue when it comes to choreographing action and consequently die hard never picks up steam die harder is impossible to take seriously even for minute in fact the movie often seems deliberately campy and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it good you do laugh but you laugh at the film not with it die hard should have never been cleared for takeoff
under any other circumstances would not be discussing the ending of film to the extent that will in this particular review however in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful minute dissection of the ending is necessary even though will not reveal the details of the last scenes do proceed at your own risk the movie opens quite poorly might add as child psychologist malcolm crowe bruce willis looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm past patients distraught the suicidal man cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself cut to the next fall as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case trouble young man named cole haley joel osment one of the only child actors in while didn want to bludgeoned over the head with blunt instrument after about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences we learn that cole has the sixth sense the gift of being able to communicate with the dead and this as they say is where the healing begins the sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon twist ending that knew going into the film one of roger ebert colleges was kind enough to give it away on recent segment of siskel and ebert although was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin film for thousands of patrons soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been blessing in disguise ve always been sucker for surprise endings my favorite movie is the usual suspects and rarely dislike film that sports one here since knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film conclusion the possibly of being bamboozled into loving bad movie solely because of its ending something ve fallen victim to in the past was eliminated and indeed my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment stripped of the element of surprise the film was put to the task of showing what it really had instead of simply hiding behind shocking conclusion after seeing its true colors came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is despite what the many champions of the movie may say void of any real power it neat concept but not one that justifies being made into feature length movie in fact the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as sort of prelude to the supposedly earth shattering revelation that is yet to come and when the final moments do come it huge letdown the end makes no sense at all it stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on fundamental and very rare level won go into any details but suffice to say that as far as can tell it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for second must be suffering from very acute case of attention deficit disorder now in all fairness cannot say for sure that would have guessed the ending however stupid it may be had it not been revealed to me before hand however feel very confident that as well as anyone who had seen few twilight zone episodes would have seen it coming mile away the fact that movie goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped ironically to fully appreciate the best scene that of cole and malcolm attending little girl funeral the viewer is required to be aware of very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy wouldn have even known about this mental disease if hadn by pure dumb luck caught dateline nbc the other week when they did feature story on it despite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and brauva performance from osment where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace in the end the sixth sense is too chalk full of contradictions and just isn plausible enough to warrant even slight recommendation
brian de palma snake eyes stars nicolas cage evil twin who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother like foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood cage yells with the ferocity of man with bad case of caffeine overload de palma whose last great film the untouchables was crafted over decade ago seems to have lost his magic in snake eyes he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of skilled cast only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material the rest of the actors become caricatures in this by the numbers thriller ryuichi sakamoto atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene heavy on the long violin notes its rhythm is punctuated by thunder the script by de palma and lost world david koepp sets the action during hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise only the latter is achieved cage plays rick santoro corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money the movie takes place over single evening when world championship fight is being held with flashy bad wardrobe and altin cell phone rick is an obnoxious cop who doesn know when to shut up spouting cliched and ridiculous dialog he screams such lines as was made for the sewer baby actually the line is more apropos for the movie as whole sinise plays kevin dunne naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy who has come to watch the fight but most people in the film are not who they seem to be and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess the plot which is told in endless flashbacks concerns the assassination of the secretary through scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen that adjective is of course redundant in hollywood thrillers the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again sometimes from different perspective and sometimes not although brian de palma film requires certain amount of gratuitous violence this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie the movie outline has some promise but the movie itself is leaden the film takes itself all too seriously at best it is 1940s style movie little humor would have helped the script some but complete rewrite would have been better and although hate to say it different director would have been the biggest improvement snake eyes runs 39 it is rated for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers

synopsis in sooner than you think america the future of law enforcement resides in blade squad ragtag group of culturally diverse rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on their backs dangerous criminal however attempts to destroy blade squad after his brother dies while being chased by them comments so what do an ex gangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop former prostitute with substance abuse problem and junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common why they re all members of blade squad an elite new crimefighting unit wearing siyah uniforms rollerblades and jetpacks they also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one another la the marines in james cameron aliens yes it blade squad the fox network wednesday night movie of the week this movie marking its dubious world premiere today curiously has number of guest stars how can movie have guest stars you may ask well blade squad is not really movie so to speak but hour pilot for possible tv series packaged as movie blade squad is dumb blade squad is loud blade squad is obnoxious blade squad will probably be ratings hit and spawn long lived tv series why not after all television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars knight rider fast helicopters airwolf and super fast motorcycles street hawk and viewers have eaten it up in the past so why not crimefighters with jet powered roller blades to be honest as made for tv presentation blade squad is at least watchable the film has relatively large cast of characters surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script and enough action sequences to keep one half interested imagine adolescent males probably the target audience of this turkey would get kick out of it tried to keep that in mind when watched blade squad can remember liking airwolf and street hawk when was 10 or 11 and although this isn saying much blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie had the displeasure of wasting time on the insipidly awful generation huge disappointment considering the comic book terrific two year beginning but digress despite its limited appeal blade squad has lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become tv series one it suffers from mtv syndrome lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewer senses while near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background oh yeah dylan knockin on heaven door and bowie afraid of americans are used here in rather poor taste two blade squad needs new crew for the sound the substandard sound editing irritated me to no end characters dialogue at times sounded choppy and unintelligible during one important scene song played loudly in the background when character spoke the song volume dropped but did not disappear as soon as that character finished speaking the song volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke this sounds trivial sure but it distracted me immensely finally this is commercial television foul language is not allowed typically on commercial television thus don use foul language in made for tv production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner in an early scene of the film for example the lead good guy and bad guy have minor confrontation in the streets when the good guy spouts out bad word driver conveniently honks his car horn off screen to muffle the word out in seinfeld episode this technique proved funny here it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably perhaps future writers if show is spun out of the movie could take cue from marvel comics 2099 series of comics make up bunch of new bad words for the future this way you don need bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language compared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies blade squad is suitable exercise in camp when compared to say movie studio film blade squad has lot in common with term which shares its initials bs review written august 12 1998
1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood two movies dealing with the same subject or to be precise same high concept in summer 1994 that high concept was mad bomber action thriller in few weeks thrillride of the summer actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland where gaerity tommy lee jones ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material escapes from prison he comes to boston where he accidentally notices jimmy dove jeff bridges dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police few people except gaerity know the dove violent past when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror directed specifically at dove colleagues friends and relatives dove who is just going to retire and start family now must confront the mad bomber while speed doesn even try to bother with plot and characters using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all screenplay by john bateer and john rice barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama the plot is of course full of implausibilities the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual no matter how brilliant he is can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay those questions same as in the case of speed could be forgotten while the action goes on but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters because of them movie seems little bit too long and boring at times the most annoying element of the film however is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber his acting is so over the top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive the film have few bright points though some of the action scenes are fine which should be credited to director stephen hopkins predator ii judgement night and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove colleague but all in all blown away is film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous yet hardly unforgettable competitor
whenever government starts meddling into other countries affairs under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political religious or ethnic persecution the other side is ready to use mantra that says look who talking what have you done to the indians however even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes hollywood is just another example with its revisionist westerns made in early 1990s those movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus discovery of america one of such examples is geronimo an american legend 1993 western directed by walter hill film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and beyaz settlers the hero of the film is geronimo played by wes studi leader of apaches fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to beyaz settlers during the second half of 19th century when the movie begins in 1885 geronimo and his apaches made peace with government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation however broken promises injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless with not more 30 or so of his followers he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign general crook gene hackman commander of army forces respects geronimo and knows that even his 000 force isn enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest instead he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches lt charles gatewood jason patric and indian hunter al sieber robert duvall together with young lt britton davis matt damon they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo geronimo an american legend like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors so the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies almost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people although such elements of john millius screenplay do indeed have some basis in history they harm the story of geronimo to be honest walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time instead they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band to make even worse hill has some real problems with pacing and style and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one story about geronimo and story about his pursuers the movie should have been better if it turned to geronimo life before and after his last uprising in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood the difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting wes studi cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans was perfect choice for geronimo not only because he resembles geronimo but because he induces lot of passion in his role contrary to him we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his beyaz enemies while this could be expected from someone like jason patric it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall even hill directing is bellow expectations battle scenes are too short and like in many of his late films force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s even his old associate music composer ry cooder disappoints with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic on the other hand photography by lloyd ahern ii with the use of kirmizi lenses gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere ideal for this movie that was supposed to be melancholic epic all in all compared with some of the hollywood examples of political correctness this film isn so bad but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better

seen december 1997 at 50 at the glenwood movieplex cinemas oneida ny theater #3 by myself for free free pass [theater rating good seats sound and picture] there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons they provide method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation watching flubber really clinched this idea for me because it just live action cartoon that presents itself as regular comedy it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality and how important it is to actually have story the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted cartoony atmosphere we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard williams the typical supposedly likable mad scientist within the first 10 minutes we get at least half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is phillip memory loss seems less like cartoony gag and more like real case of alzhiemer disease isn this rather lowbrow comedy he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on nude figure drawing class an inappropriate joke for kids movie if ever saw one we learn he has stood his up fiancee sara harden twice at the altar simply because he forgotten sara claims to love him but says if he forgets the wedding again she ll stop loving him sign of childish attitude the film denies it has but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve and it no surprise the major conflicts here are related christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft scientist who not only wants to steal phillip ideas but his woman too what worse is that sara actually seems interested in him wilson works for rival college that wants to buy out medfield which is going broke unless phillip can invent something to save the day one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced but is all but forgotten about thereafter it obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny unfortunately the flubber like all the special effects in this film looks very fake and unconvincing flubber also seems to have intelligence and personality and by the time it performs song and dance routine you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy since phillip absent mindedness is forgotten about and somehow push the story along but it clear how weak this premise is from the get go and the film just gets worse all the jokes involve people getting hit by fast moving flubber powered objects including bowling balls flying cars that don fly well and basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air it all presented with complete logic and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes during the basketball scene the coach for the rival team actually says think they might be cheating to which the referee replies there no rules about jumping too high predictable doesn begin to describe the motions the film goes through especially after the halfway point and it not how terribly contrived the plot is it the way it broken down scene by scene with absolutely no transition not only that but all the actors here especially williams seem bored to tears say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with bluescreen so it almost forgivable when you realize they re talking to nothing and interacting with nothing it safe to say everything that could be bad about flubber is the only original element the film has is the world first romance between machine and human but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it and like the rest of the film you won
director doug ellin kissing fool released earlier this year is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story like sitcom with jokes so lame that it would be impossible to overlay laugh track on it the movie meanders along insulting the viewers intelligence in almost every frame the script by james frey and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless lines you ve heard before not wearing any underwear the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster max in what she assumes will be sure fire come on line max chicago biggest playboy decides to get married after whirlwind love affair with sam short for samantha max and sam possess two irritating personalities and they hold little chemistry for each other or the audience max is played without any style by david schwimmer schwimmer whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of personality makes an unlikely lover his costar mili avital as sam is cut from the same cloth so they can be argued to be matched pair after all people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn to each other ditto for similar looks so why shouldn the personality challenged be attracted the implausible plot has max asking his best friend jay jason lee to hit on sam as test jay is supposed to try to get her to sleep with him but stop short of the actual act max being promiscuous by nature worries that his future bride may have the same need to sleep around as he does the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work neither the script nor the actors make this test believable the 64 000 question is how do you know you re with the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness to the film finally there is the film attempt at physical comedy jay ex girlfriend natasha vanessa angel becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else natasha rips jay shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa as she throws her hair on his bare chest she demands he pull it this is supposed to be funny most films have some saving grace some bit part was done especially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture wasn kissing fool on the other hand has nothing to recommend it kissing fool runs 45 it is rated for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers
some movies pre release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they re finally released everyone just goes along with it thus sometimes films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations last year it was the thin kirmizi line this year winner is the hurricane pure unadulterated tripe that is all of sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool acclaimed director norman jewison biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun and that supposed to be ok because see it true story it about rubin hurricane carter denzel washington legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of ghastly racist detective dan hedaya who had it in for the big shot hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing beyaz man with knife in self defense but who cares right when rubin was only ten he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison to the rescue lesra martin vicellous reon shannon and his team of wanna be detectives lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well off canadian beyaz people hanna unger schreiber to get an education lesra and his buddies go to book sale where lesra picks out his very first book the sixteenth round rubin autobiography immediately thereafter schreiber character tells lesra sometimes we don pick the books we read they pick us hmmm after few visits to the prison they become convinced of rubin innocence and launch their own full scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings of course we re already told that he innocent movie like this is especially frustrating because we re not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life all too obviously we re getting the hollywood watered down version that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it it almost cruel the melodrama isn of the entertaining kind either it the hokey rammed down your throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo saintliness of our four protagonists the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it no frills courtroom movie it formula stripped to the bare necessities you have your wrongly accused siyah man you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene but there nothing else you expect some sort of involving investigation but that not necessary since we re implicitly informed of his innocence thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding brooding to himself brooding to other inmates brooding to lesra brooding to lesra canadian friends brooding in letters don think ll ever look at brooding the same way again it wasn long before got tired of hearing the hurricane exceedingly deep meditations on his condition wanted something to happen as for washington performance in the title role figured have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it received he is top notch though still boring how is that possible well he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly unfortunately what jewison asked him to do is load of crap what waste of great performer speaking of wastes why the hell did john hannah agree to do this he an extremely talented actor and love him dearly but what is he doing here to call his character along with schreiber and unger stick figure would be gross understatement all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas as benevolent as do gooders come if they re to play major part in this movie why not make them real people with real feelings and emotions look if you re going to make formula movie don undermine the formula courtroom dramas can be fun but this is ridiculous not only is it trite it boring
okay bear with me all cause first off have to get this off my chest what the hell is up with that damn crab whew okay cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end as cute as the crab maybe even know that you need more footage than that and that wasn the only thing getting on my nerves the cutesy gimmicks saccharine sweet score soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar as amanda and sean patrick flannery as tom might have held some appeal during oh say the first 10 minutes of the movie at first the movie moves along at quick interesting pace it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters totally random fairy godfather type person on the street whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just doesn die ridiculous concept yes but at this point willing to accept it because willing to accept that this is how amanda life is changed how her powers are received later on the movie can seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying they weren just repetitive they were out of place and unnecessary the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed sometimes dwelling too long on particular development amanda suddenly becoming great chef her falling in love with tom etc sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good some places the plot just doesn make sense sometimes it way too contrived the crab bit for example and sometimes too corny peaches emitting dry ice can beat that all in all the plot seemed fragmented unconnected not romantic at all and only funny in some places so okay do the magic powers come from the crab or the fairy godfather she can float now too and all of sudden instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches she can put her emotions into her food tom all of sudden just accepts amanda witchcraft in the end would people really dine in restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac video what the hell is up with that damn crab it is unfortunate because liked the basic premise of the movie until it became too fantastical and tiresome the film seemed to skirt around serious theme or at least theme for while but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and minutes of people crying at their tables the humor was good in some places nolan gets the funniest bits including that incomprehensible totally random thing with the dolls gellar and flannery are qualified actors and gellar has particular charm but much prefer her playing the saucy buffy or even annette in the upcoming cruel intentions than this sorry excuse for character it almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible the supporting character nolan was highlight though he reminded me bit of kevin in you ve got mail see footnotes and as always typical of chick flick romantic comedy there seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background cued up at all the right places this sort of got on the nerves after while too simply irresistible is not hard to understand light funny in some places and generally disappointing because it can draw the line between romance and protracted sap between humor and tired slapstick and how could refrain from making pun simply irresistible is all too easy to resist first viewing 99 did anyone else think this was tad bit similar to you ve got mail or the shop around the corner business rivals fall in love female counterpart business is in danger of being shut down female as mother like figure guiding her the annoying hysterical ex girlfriends _really_ like sarah michelle gellar wardrobe
in life eddie murphy and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison after about an hour of watching this movie you begin to realize how their characters feel fortunately for audience members there chance to escape the nearest exit this undoubtedly is eddie murphy worst movie and that an accomplishment remember the golden child harlem nights compared to life they look like citizen kane life is long predictable foul mouthed and only intermittently funny its 100 minute running time feels like 100 years robert ramsey and matthew stone script basically consist of murphy and lawrence referring to everyone around them as motherf or you lose count how many times both those obnoxious offensive words are used and if that all it takes to write script than any illiterate jackass can sit at word processor and compose movie but like life it will probably stink to be honest the screening audience surrounding me in the theater yucked it up but these were the same people who howled at all the flatulence and fat jokes as well life is as sophisticated as belch it crude and stereotypical years ago movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient second class people good for being only maids and servants for the most part the lot of blacks and other racial groups have improved but new more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies in many recent films through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers blacks are presented as fast talking conniving scam artists or hip hop gun crazy sex crazed youths both sets of caricatures are demeaning and the fault does not rest with the actors they have to eat too it is with the people who write the scripts the studios who green light the projects and the audiences who accept these portrayals without protest life only redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly ages murphy and lawrence into 90 year olds otherwise life is an embarrassment blot on the resumes of those associated with it see it at your own risk
>from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong at reagan high four girls are sitting on top of the world courtney shane played by rose mcgowan holds the title of meanest most disrespectful soul in the school everyone hates her but everyone envies her due to her popularity courtney is the leader of her clique which also includes julie played by rebecca gayheart liz purr played by charlotte roldan and marcie played by julie benz are the other three in the group it is liz seventeenth birthday and julie courtney and marcie concur that they will play seemingly innocent prank on her but the prank results in the death of liz just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like murder committed by someone else and also just like in other teen directed movies one of the four don agree with hiding it this time that character being julie and finally just like in other teen movies there is witness outside the group trying to hide the truth this time that character being fern mayo judy greer who is subject to many cracks from courtney group as well as the entire school >from here jawbreaker turns into predictable tale of revenge bad morals and at least trying to do the right thing not only is the script weak on whole the acting is horrid thanks to large amount of the main cast judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional annoying character as she overacts every line she has also on the bad side of acting is julie benz almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers on the positive side of acting rose mcgowan performs well here but doesn match her wickedly clever performance as tatum in 1996 scream mcgowan role is annoying but this only adds to the film she is wickedly mean and even though she well written character you downright hate her faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart who is always exceptionally believable as her roles when the script feeds her one or two dimensional character she turns it into three always putting strong emotion and power into her roles gayheart isn given as much to do here as she was in 1998 urban legend but you can still get strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker jawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in we get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident and get into things that don have anything to do with the actual film the beginning and ending are strong it just the middle that needs lot of help during the body of the movie it is undeniably repetitive never progressing towards conclusion nothing to grab the viewer interest is around and the same extremely annoying song plays over and over again jawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless but falls flat the few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with bang all in all horrible disappointment the bottom line the tagline reads even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside yes that is too true no matter how good this film may have looked it fails to deliver
woof too bad that leap of faith was the title of 1992 comedy starring steve martin and debra winger because that what required to watch this incredulous howler starring bruce willis as of all things psychologist not since the reagan administration has there been an acting stretch of such magnitude alas mickey rourke we hardly knew ye story opens with campy kick willis is treating patient who abruptly steps out of the window to take the best flying leap since charles durning dove in the hudsucker proxy she goes splat he goes ugh and his character spends the rest of the film colorblind really the good doctor then moves to sunny where he rooms with an old college chum scott bakula therapist who getting death threats from someone in his monday evening group buddy bites it in the second reel no surprise there and willis agrees to take over both the group and the death threats for his troubles as therapy man willis gets to share some cut from nc17 love scenes with the lover jane march while dodging nails cars and rattlesnakes why it have to be snakes color of night is the worst movie of the year period forget north clifford or heaven help us even on deadly ground here is movie misfire so audaciously awful that you can help but wonder how the actors all kept straight faces while filming for starters the group is collection of mixed nuts better suited to bob newhart than bruce willis these are realistic portrayals of the mentally unhealthy playing prissy obsessive compulsive cuckoos nest alumni brad dourif alone may set the psychology profession back ten years the plot wreck with laughable dialogue pointless pov shifts and the one big secret solvable in the first fifteen minutes director richard rush who once helmed freebie and the bean doesn seem to mind unfazed by the nincompoop plot and cuckoo characterizations he overfills the film with enough canny camera shots and zany set pieces to make the effort almost worth watching his token freeway chase is ok but the director has more fun with vertiginous ending ala most recently fatal analysis acting credits are across the board awful willis can be forgiven because he filming die hard as we speak but what about ruben blades insulting presence as the cop or lesley ann warren stereotypical sex addict or worst offender jane march as mystery girl who no real mystery shudder bottom line how they all kept straight faces ll never know
the plot of big momma house is martin lawrence in fat suit and dress that not just the high concept premise it the fully realized all encompassing plot such an emphasis is not unheard of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment one need merely look back to last summer when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent the trap inherent in such an approach is that the high concept plot idea better be pretty well realized or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer because you can bet there will be nothing else worth second of your time not developed character not provocative theme not witty twist you will get 90 plus minutes of martin lawrence in fat suit and dress nothing more nothing less those who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have shot at enjoying the one note dud that is big momma house others will simply stare mouth agape at its sheer unapologetic laziness lawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner an undercover expert on stakeout assignment with his partner john paul giamatti dangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco terrence howard has escaped from prison and the feds think he headed for his former girlfriend and presumed but never proved accomplice sherry nia long sherry however has fled with her son trent jascha washington possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ella mitchell better known as big momma indeed sherry appears to be on her way but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows big momma house bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs doubtfire director raja gosnell edited that film and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom but there just as strong whiff of tootsie in the main character attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to woman unfortunately big momma house makes ridiculous decision neither of those other films made instead of having the protagonist pose as completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses it places malcolm in the position of playing friend and family member to several other characters suspension of disbelief in big momma house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and or stupid since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other of course laughs trumps logic every time and big momma house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny and it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as foul tempered beast while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry unfortunately no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic altin mine involved in one real person pretending to be another very different real person so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags malcolm reacting violently to big momma explosive diarrhea attack malcolm as momma schooling pair of cocky teens in basketball malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments malcolm delivering baby because big momma is the town midwife one of the few sequences that works martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times but there no reason to care whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character he just big momma without the makeup on won waste time commenting on how ineptly the set up of the escaped convict is employed since it was clearly waste of time to the film makers there are few token scenes of lester looming as threatening figure but he ultimately distraction in film that really about its central visual incongruity and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long posterior never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing but know that when film maker tries to throw concept at me and pretend that it an entire film duck out of the way the gross implausibility of big momma house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big cleverly constructed laughs its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant big momma house is ridiculous _and_ not funny it just sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in fat suit and dress
the film may be called mercury rising but that title doesn describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture routine thriller that combines government cover ups with cloying and poorly motivated buddy story the hook that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic however aside from giving actor miko hughes chance to win raves for his performance this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than convenient plot device those expecting to see even semi thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard to swallow don know whether the problem is in the original book simple simon or in the screenplay adaptation but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which suspension of disbelief is no longer possible once again certain standby plot elements the high level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent are recycled and not to good effect while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense the story begins with formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with heart of altin art jeffries bruce willis is confronted with his own failure unable to resolve hostage crisis in time he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy handedly establishes his motivation for protecting year old simon lynch miko hughes when he discovers the autistic child hiding in closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex football player soon art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time with the evil hit man who looks like an ex football player always just step behind them along the way they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy chi mcbride and the supporting female who may or may not become love interest kim dickens why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex football player apparently the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra secret code called mercury to make sure it can be cracked they do the most intuitive thing possible place sample of it in nerds puzzle magazine of course no one can solve it no one except autistic simon that is when he calls the phone number listed in the solution he gets the nsa as result the cold hearted sneering government man alec baldwin decides that simon has to be eliminated for the good of the country of course but he hasn counted on the tough fbi agent with heart of altin even though everyone in the audience has it hard to get worked up about routine thriller that doesn do anything exceptionally well and does quite few things rather poorly for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time to time but even the most exciting scenes such as the one where art and simon are crouched down avoiding passing trains aren that pulse pounding the climactic struggle is real ho hum affair which leads to finale that is painful in its obviousness overall director harold becker is constantly struggling and failing to generate even moment that isn derivative or obligatory bruce willis star seems to be fading this is his fourth straight lackluster outing following last man standing the fifth element and the jackal willis isn terrible but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through and often does alec baldwin combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice does some scenery chewing but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace the film real star is young miko hughes heather langenkamp son in wes craven new nightmare who does as good job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual but is about 50 years younger mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain the replacement killers and marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers for those who like action and adventure in the theater this has not been good year hopefully the advent of summer will change that until then the best choices for bruce willis or any other action hero are on video and if you re determined to see mercury rising check out the morning sky in early may
recently one night young director named baz luhrmann couldn sleep he tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food then he took down volume of shakespeare work and read it cover to cover never really paying attention to the words or plot and then as climax he took out his video camera and pressed the on button the result william shakespeare romeo juliet the worst film ever made and complete failure though to be fair an interesting complete failure the idea at the film core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds this is done by moving the camera around at rapid rate so that we can see what is going on and filming the dialogue in voice over and shooting leonardo dicaprio like calvin klein model and making the frame go still while flashing the character name at the bottom and filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion mean man this is the 90s dude however ve seen terrible films that are fun to watch examples are batman and robin and the island of doctor moreau that rule doesn apply here this is film that takes itself seriously that is it major fault another problem was pointed out by my friend alex who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout the original play is powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and didn take sides here it clear that we are supposed to side with romeo just look at the way they film him from the begining he our hero and this doesn work and dicaprio awful performance doesn help luhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us the result is mess you can feel him striving to be something he isn he tries to pull of mix in which drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles he tries very hard key word tries oh look he filming above water action from below pretty what does it represent why do people do ugly things scrambled away from my tv set feeling guilty as if could never read the play again and keep straight face
warren beatty diane keaton goldie hawn and gary shandling star as pair of married couples whose complacent lives are about to be shaken up in director peter chelsom version of the classic romantic screwball comedy in town country the drawing room farce of the 30 dealt with sexual innuendo and relied on wit and great deal of commotion and noise to place the viewer in the thick of the duplicitous romantic action back then impossibly wealthy scions of society with too much free time would get themselves wrapped up in all sorts of sexual peccadilloes with spouses and lovers only to have everything come out all right in the end see the philadelphia story for great farce town country has the impossibly wealthy protagonists with too much free time the kind of people that have jobs but never seem to work and sexual misconduct on several levels but there is almost no life to original script by michael laughlin and buck henry and this is t&c downfall there is obviously great deal of hollywood talent in front of and behind the camera involved in town country but without likable or at least interesting story to carry through their efforts it is all for naught and that what we get here naught porter stoddard beatty is high powered new york architect with very good life indeed his 25 year marriage to ellie diane keaton appears on the surface to be perfect but there are cracks just below this pristine surface his wife is suspicious of his whereabouts his kids don need him and his best friends griffin garry shandling and mona goldie hawn are in the midst of divorce porter tries to get control of his life before it is too late but like man fighting against quicksand his struggle just sinks him deeper at the 90 minute mark of town country asked myself what the point wasn entertained laughed three times over silly little pratfalls and spent most of the film marking time til the end warren beatty wanders around with his character in bewildered fog making problems for himself by thinking with part of his anatomy other than his head keaton ellie is an empty headed flake who can see the obvious as porter screws around on her and as you get to know them who would want friends like griffin and mona the supporting cast is given nothing to do and sometimes does harm to the film given the material they are forced to use nastassja kinski plays cellist with whom porter has fling the actress who has eerily failed to age over the years is miscast as the air headed musician and the character doesn belong anyway jenna elfman is sweet but smart ditz who joins porter and griffin on one of their tacked on misadventures andie macdowell is absolutely painful to watch as wealthy heiress is there any other kind in this movie who comes on to porter the saving grace is pair of quirky perf by charlton heston and marian seldes as macdowell very strange parents glib rationalization of infidelity like if he doesn speak english it doesn count are staple for the screenplay the morality of the film seems to be if you can get away with it go for it the cast of characters are mostly people you wouldn want to know never mind befriend the actors do their best but are hamstrung by the weak material helmer chelsom who made the outstanding offbeat comedy funny bones is mired in the mess of script and never puts his imprint on town country the production values are high as one expects from big budget hollywood film but the opulent sets by caroline hanania lavish wardrobes by molly maginnis and top notch photography by william fraker cannot save town country the film has had long list of production and distribution problems and it might have been better for me anyway if hollywood just said no to this movie give it
anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon fact based novel the king and and it big expensive and soulless though good looking its lavish sets fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson script so much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting this is jodie foster first movie since the jaw droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn the best choice to show off her acting chops she trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens the uptight widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam now thailand with her son to instruct the king chow yun fat son in the ways of the west because the ways of england are the ways of the world the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family 58 kids with 10 more in the way impressive no the eldest prince is none too happy about this father have offended you in some way why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher but soon gets to know anna and her stern mother who loves you personality better and comes to like her meanwhile siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma the king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain doing which arouses suspicion in siam putting anna in an uncomfortable position she is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king prejudices he though self righteous as ever can help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly quietly develop affections for each other there is scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king younger daughters dies it your classic deathbed scene with the girl mournful eyes staring at her father who tries only semi successfully to maintain his composure anna then comes in and cries bit the sequence was there for purpose to evoke strong emotional response from the viewer usually sucker for such scenes and yet this time was just sitting there my emotions untouched this remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren we never develop connections to the characters never given reason to care this ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant whose last film was ever after one of my favorites of 1998 do not doubt tennant ability to put together decent movie but anna and the king aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient the sets and scenery are gorgeous but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur even terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin kirmizi line than tennant can muster from $75 million worth of props and shoot in malaysia we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger than life awe liked both foster and yun fat who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles foster generally stoic persona serves her well here as she is playing reserved formal and rather underdeveloped character yun fat is especially effective perfectly conveying the king of siam sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts what does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations the cast is great the director is talented and the budget is lavish but this ill advised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form compelling whole this is an emotionless costume epic
with his successful books and movies michael crichton is doing well with early successes with westworld 1973 and coma 1978 and recent films such as jurassic park 1993 his films have been entertaining however he seems to taken wrong turn somewhere with sphere this $100 million mess by good director barry levison disclosure is dull long winded and huge disappointment considering the huge budget the all star cast and story by crichton sphere is majorly disappointing the film opens with norman goodman hoffman psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors however when he arrives he his told by supervisor barnes peter coyote that he is actually investigating an spacecraft along with goodman is mathematician harry adams jackson biologist beth halperin stone and ted fielding liev schrieber they investigate the spaceship find massive sphere inside meet an alien intelligence called jerry and basically weird crap happens unfortunately something went wrong along the way with sphere the film starts off entertaining enough but throughout this very long movie it just gets sillier and sillier the film jaunts along from scene to scene never fully explaining what is going on the actors and directing don help either hoffman is on autopilot and almost seems embarrassed throughout the movie churning out dull lines and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie stone is useless displaying no emotion and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson who funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere but he hardly in it and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone the same goes for peter coyote who hams it up as the officer but is then killed off halfway through the director barry levinson who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure 1994 messes up with the drama and the action the drama scenes are quite frankly boring and the action scenes suffer from overkill with levison throwing the camera all over the place much like the godawful speed 1997 the writing doesn help much either although crichton is great with plots he terrible with dialogue and practically every line in sphere is dud the speech is too simple was hoping it would be bit more intelligent practically every line is just stating the obvious none of it is smart also where the hell did the budget go the sphere itself is impressive and there few nice special effect shots but where the $100 million went is anyone guess there giant squid attack in the picture but not once does the audience see the squid even though the film has massive budget assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid and if handled correctly it probably would but the whole scene is done badly and was just hoping we could see the stupid squid finally the film has no idea what genre to be levison can handle his own plot it leaps from hokey sci fi to horror and finally the shining event horizon psychological thriller and of course the film is very much like the abyss 1988 although in it defense crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released and is far superior to this rubbish it not all that bad though the plot is all right there few jump scenes although nothing very scary and there the occasionally interesting bit but overall sphere is big waste of some fine talent lot of money and potentially good movie not really worth seeing overall rating= review by david wilcock
