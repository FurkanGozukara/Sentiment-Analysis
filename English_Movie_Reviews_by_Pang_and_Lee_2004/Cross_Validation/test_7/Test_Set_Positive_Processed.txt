films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success whether they re about superheroes batman superman spawn or geared toward kids casper or the arthouse crowd ghost world but there never really been comic book like from hell before for starters it was created by alan moore and eddie campbell who brought the medium to whole new level in the mid 80s with 12 part series called the watchmen to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look little odd the book or graphic novel if you will is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes in other words don dismiss this film because of its source if you can get past the whole comic book thing you might find another stumbling block in from hell directors albert and allen hughes getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in well anything but riddle me this who better to direct film that set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society the ghetto in question is of course whitechapel in 1888 london east end it filthy sooty place where the whores called unfortunates are starting to get little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision when the first stiff turns up copper peter godley robbie coltrane the world is not enough calls in inspector frederick abberline johnny depp blow to crack the case abberline widower has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium upon arriving in whitechapel he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly heather graham say it isn so and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can stomach don think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper so won go into the particulars here other than to say moore and campbell have unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay in the comic they don bother cloaking the identity of the ripper but screenwriters terry hayes vertical limit and rafael yglesias les mis rables do good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end it funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because after all an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts and from hell ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days who holds back the electric car who made steve guttenberg star don worry it ll all make sense when you see it now onto from hell appearance it certainly dark and bleak enough and it surprising to see how much more it looks like tim burton film than planet of the apes did at times it seems like sleepy hollow the print saw wasn completely finished both color and music had not been finalized so no comments about marilyn manson but cinematographer peter deming don say word ably captures the dreariness of victorian era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black and white comic oscar winner martin childs shakespeare in love production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place even the acting in from hell is solid with the dreamy depp turning in typically strong performance and deftly handling british accent ians holm joe gould secret and richardson 102 dalmatians log in great supporting roles but the big surprise here is graham cringed the first time she opened her mouth imagining her attempt at an irish accent but it actually wasn half bad the film however is all good 00 for strong violence gore sexuality language and drug content
every now and then movie comes along from suspect studio with every indication that it will be stinker and to everybody surprise perhaps even the studio the film becomes critical darling mtv films _election high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon is current example did anybody know this film existed week before it opened the plot is deceptively simple george washington carver high school is having student elections tracy flick reese witherspoon is an over achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question way way high mr matthew broderick sick of the megalomaniac student encourages paul popular but slow jock to run and paul nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well for personal reasons the dark side of such sleeper success is that because expectations were so low going in the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be you can help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have _election good film does not live up to its hype what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ released few months earlier the similarities are staggering tracy flick _election_ is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs and is involved with the school play max fischer _rushmore_ is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs and is involved with the school play the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between teacher and his student the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between teacher and his student tracy flick is from single parent home which has contributed to her drive max fischer is from single parent home which has contributed to his drive the male bumbling adult in _election_ matthew broderick pursues an extramarital affair gets caught and his whole life is ruined he even gets bee sting the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ bill murray pursues an extramarital affair gets caught and his whole life is ruined he gets several bee stings and so on what happened how is it that an individual screenplay _rushmore_ and novel _election_ contain so many significant plot points and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other made from two different studios from genre the high school geeks revenge movie that hadn been fully formed yet even so the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick witherspoon and newcomer jessica campbell as paul anti social sister tammy broderick here is playing the mr rooney role from _ferris bueller_ and he seems to be having the most fun he had since then witherspoon is revelation it early in the year it comedy and teenagers have little clout but for my money witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination and once campbell character gets going like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium then you re won over one thing that been bothering me since ve seen it there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film suppose that coming from mtv films should expect no less but the film starts off light and airy like sitcom as the screws tighten and the tensions mount alexander payne decides to add elements that frankly distract from the story it is bad enough that mr doesn like tracy determination to win at all costs but did they have to throw in the student teacher relationship even so there no logical reason why mr has an affair when he does there lot to like in _election_ but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex driven mark this as disappointment
the ultimate match up between good and evil the untouchables is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry based on the 1959 television show of the same title the untouchables may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences some excellent acting memorable score and clever script the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public elliot ness and small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order however as ness soon learns in order to stabilize peace you have to bend few laws the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes the film begins with capone played perfectly by deniro declaring that he is not violent man and he is firm believer in following all laws the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone men bombs restaurant that contains many innocent people including little girl from this point we know capone is evil not only because he kills without hesitation but also because he is lying bastard right from the first five minutes of the film de palma has created hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs this developed hatred is before the film hero ness is even introduced found this approach to be very clever because in small duration of time there is great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone the film only gets better from this point with the formation of the untouchables there is group of men wearing long dark overcoats and hats they walk in unison and they only look forward as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films one that comes to mind is the matrix when neo morpheus trinity and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930 style the similarities between these two are countless the untouchables has some of the hippest bravest heroes in any action film the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone army each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others elliot ness played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner is character that surely grows during the course of the film he begins as man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be however as the film develops so does ness his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in sean connery who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role plays malone an aging cop who decides to make one final run as member of the untouchables malone acts as mentor to ness he teaches him the chicago way to do things when they attack with knife you attack with gun connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed andy garcia does wonderful job as george stone young man who is just becoming police officer as ness grows he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed have ever seen also very similar to the matrix they are exciting and intense >from western like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps the scenes are well thought out and well executed the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement its pounding drum beats act as rhythm for the actors the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified this film is pure entertainment and contains unique blend of great acting great directing and great action some scenes capone and the baseball bat the train station have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid
call 911 for the cliche police if you must but the eyes are the window to the soul the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with gaze paul newman ralph fiennes anthony hopkins morgan freeman you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying word that there is something going on in their minds that the characters they play are real human beings we will never have chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been great actor but he had that unique quality in his eyes in gridlock an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire shakur and his co star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry shakur and roth play ezekiel spoon whitmore and alexander stretch rome two detroit buddies who share spoken word jazz trio an apartment and drug addiction with cookie thandie newton when new year eve party ends with cookie comatose after drug overdose spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time they soon make new year resolution to get into rehab but that proves to be easier said than done as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting road block of bureaucracy confusion and kirmizi tape the government might be the least of their obstacles however as they find themselves suspects in the murder of drug dealer and on the run from nasty thug vondie curtis hall in order for you to buy into gridlock at all you have to accept it as surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie they are going to government offices on new year day in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all gridlock may actually be response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey 1991 falling down which found besieged middle class beyaz male venting his righteous anger against the system during trek through inner city los angeles in falling down michael douglas fens the character personalized license plate echoed in gridlock by the drug lord reper plates whips out gun because he can get breakfast at mcdonald in gridlock spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into rehab center and where the unhinged fens became heroic surrogate for audiences writer director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation one bureaucrat responds to tirade from stretch with the question do you expect the world to stop just because you picked _today_ to clean up the world in gridlock is just as frustrating as the world in falling down but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system but perhaps not enough of them significant chunk of gridlock is devoted to spoon and stretch flight from reper and from the police and those sub plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments in one scene stretch scares off reper by getting chummy with police officer another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly suspected heroes in public place watching television news report of the crime which shows their pictures the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film main events perhaps making particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self destructive behavior oh the irony of it tupac shakur made career in music and movies playing the hard case and living the life to back it up in gridlock shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him spoon is an idea for character at best as written by hall but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction mostly it comes through those eyes eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch pure appetite and roth plays stretch with gleeful self destructiveness he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again which is as much an obstacle to spoon goal as any agency or enemy gridlock most cruelly comic scene finds stretch helping spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with tiny pocket knife and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him with friends like that spoon doesn need enemies and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of man who has seen too much the tragedy now is that we won get more chances to see those eyes again
as african american detective vergil tibbs questions suspected beyaz murderer inside jail cell there is wonderful eye catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film the shot has tibbs face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars to see these bars blocking his face we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film as siyah detective conducting an investigation in southern town full of violent beyaz bigots no matter how innocent tibbs is he is still seen by these bigots as threat simply because of the color of his skin the bars show that tibbs has not been given fair chance to show exactly who he is instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous this one shot amazes me because it captures whole theme in matter of seconds it perhaps may be the most powerful image have seen in film in the heat of the night was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america jewison has very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present preceding the very original soldier story and the recently released the hurricane in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters the film which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs played superbly by sidney poitier as fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in beyaz town where is he not wanted tibbs is man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him as hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains tibbs is the perfect protagonist poitier also gives an excellent noteworthy voice to his character never nervous and always commanding his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing however unlike the hurricane where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger who won best actor for his excellent performance as sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him steiger shows great amount of skill in his role he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople he would refer to tibbs as boy and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him as the film progresses though there is very gradual change in the sheriff he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors what really enjoyed about steiger character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil instead it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future most movies would have character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in matter of minutes this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day jewison determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate in the heat of the night shows the difference between the north and the south or major city and small town in the united states during the 1960 it displays this perfectly however the actual investigation although it is not the main focus of the film lacks interest it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving credible explanation involving the murder victim there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane police officer sam being suspect was not needed also it is given that tibbs is vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered the rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson he managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 in the heat of the night and the even better in cold blood
in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer professor with such lived in naturalism that believe it may be his best performance ever since wall street douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid 80 in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world you think such man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath good natured veneer but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton douglas played the role straight and out in the open in wonder boys his performance isn showy or tour de force it simple yet truthful he embodies grady craggy old writer with predilection for pot and pink bathrobes grady instructs writers workshop while working tirelessly on follow up to the novel that put him on the map when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms grady points out in his narration that they only do so out of jealousy their target is the very writerly named james leer played by the always understated tobey maguire student full of potential and one whom grady develops mild affection for leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just hint of dry wit around the edges he portentous and gloomy as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers though his act is little too calculated he reminds me of the self imposed outcast film director jim jarmusch dead man ghost dog whenever happen to catch jarmusch in an interview see the man speaking in toneless manner the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer exclusively dressed in siyah and with his spiked hair dyed snow beyaz leer is similar guy who equates quirks with depth tobey maguire fits well in the role with his round sweet eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude but unlike cort maguire is easier to warm up to he messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility katie holmes plays hannah beautiful talented writing student just itching to get in grady pants this is plot line had trouble with douglas in his old age is beginning to resemble jerry springer man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions at first found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady maybe it because jealous and wish holmes was throwing herself at me after all may just be lowly internet critic but at least still have all my teeth then think of douglas real life companion the breathtaking catherine zeta jones seeing those two together looks lot like kidnapping suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie and pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas there is movie in there somewhere grady rather chivalrously if you ask me resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell droll frances mcdormand who is his age but also married to another professor okay maybe not so chivalrous there is great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says she was junkie for the printed word lucky for me manufactured her drug of choice robert downy plays bisexual editor who makes his entrance with towering transvestite on his arm downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many hipster intellectual he arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance the actor is perfectly cast here and remains joyous movie presence somewhere between typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor wish wonder boys had more of him searching for plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless for it meanders through its running time but that part of its charm and maybe bit biased towards the film because it takes place in haven of literary academia place greatly fond of and place rarely explored in american cinema everyone has sub genre be it war films westerns dance movies that they happen to be privy to privy to films about literary types those individuals enthralled by the written word and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half notch the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters rather than generic mapped out story points sometimes the dialogue is too clever but that problem wish found with films more often another minor quibble is that early on the film seems bit too introverted like its characters but as the story progresses it begins to open up for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types and as low key comedy for its chuckle worthy throwaway gags the gags are like those in the great robert altman the long goodbye movies where jokes exist as asides on the fringes like jokes in life often do the broader comedy such as the killing of blind dog and incessant smoking of marijuana isn ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things curtis hanson who before his last film la confidential toiled about with exploitation fare like losin it an early tom cruise sex comedy and the hand the rocks the cradle has graduated to more meaningful films he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party but in wonder boys party it fits the film is like piece of literature put up on the big screen it the cinematic equivalent to good read novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies many will find it slight but found much to savor among its subtleties
plot derek zoolander is male model he is also very dumb and impressionable for that reason he is secretly hired and trained so secret that even he doesn know about it by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia who wants to abolish child labor in his country will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed will zoolander ever grace the world his new look is this funny movie find out below critique there place in our world for stupid comedies films which don pretend to take themselves seriously are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes there also time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history might be an ideal circumstance during which to relax by watching something so completely frivolous well if you re in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time of course comedies as such are usually very subjective and could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny while others will grant them the stupid but consider it funny instead personally enjoyed it for the most part cracked up loudly during couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry snap it was also nice to see several real life models with small roles in the movie not taking themselves too seriously and if you re the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films well don look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn billy zane winona ryder christian slater david duchovny natalie portman and many many others especially liked andy dick complete make over as the masseuse hi larious but with all films of this type there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn work few particulars which didn strike my fancy included the bulimia and orgy sequence with christine taylor the break dance fighting and also never get why they use real countries in plots like this why not just make up country instead of zeroing in on certain people also could have done with less of the taylor character in general since she wasn all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then more zoolander dude but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me almost pissed myself during the gas station disaster absolutely adored the walk off contest with david bowie as the judge no less and appreciated many of zoolander moronic one liners was merman merman and dare you to get his monkey photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie you re monkey derek monkey also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film both of which zipped and zagged and established nice rhythm to it all again it to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well if you thought the trailer was dumb skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something film from which there is an obvious influence here blue steel baby yeah where joblo coming from austin powers 10 austin powers 10 deuce bigalow 10 dude where my car 10 freddy got fingered 10 jay silent bob strike back 10 joe dirt 10 meet the parents 10 say it isn so 10

the event of events is upon us people have waited twenty two years for the prequel to star wars and die hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it don think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of film has caused it is not bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history anyone who tells you it just movie is either lying or clueless it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz which is far too weak word that star wars epsode the phantom menace so effortlessly generated but that does not mean that the film itself is bad in fact it is terrific strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging the trade federation angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small peaceful planet of naboo the republic sent two jedi knights people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as the force qui gon jinn liam neeson and obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor to negotiate unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur the jedi and the queen of naboo natalie portman escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene on the way they get sidetracked to planet called tatooine where they meet the movie real focal point young anakin skywalker jake lloyd he is an innocent slave boy but the force is strong with him so qui gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as jedi as any self respecting star wars fan should know anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker >from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor movie around 70% of the characters if not more are computer generated in one form or another and though the effects are seamless the movie lacks soul think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade cinema should still be human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far with plenty of broad comic relief to go around much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar jar binks he essentially computer animated sidekick who says things like exqueeze me and mesa go now okeday and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying the visual effects are astounding although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them and the movie is thrilling triumph if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement the climactic lightsaber battle oh come on as if you didn already know among other things is outrageously entertaining and defines the term popcorn movie what made me surrender and give this movie stars was the score by john williams even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days his work here is nothing short of brilliant his use of opera during the climax really does add punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as sort of prophecy is chilling the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia when you see long time ago in galaxy far far away when the familiar music plays when the words star wars appear on screen you ll feel tingle even if you didn see the movie when it first came out in 77 it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin boy whose innocence we know will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts we know that it will do more harm than good but they do not we not only feel more involved in the story but we feel like we re seeing the beginning of saga that we have cherished for years the phantom menace although lacking in human aspects of the story is very worthy installment in the star wars it works as an action flick visually eye popping and often paralyzingly exciting it also works as an elicitor of memories piece of exquisite nostalgia 1999 eugene novikov&#137
he back and it about time was the motto for this television series pilot call it pilot don care what fox network says revival of the cult classic british tv show doctor who that spawned no series which means there are no smart network execs out there not exactly news to lot of people know the motto was well chosen the series was simple it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in type forty spaceship called tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies including the evil daleks and the master who appears in this feature played very badly by eric roberts as good as this revival was there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who is it the acting hell no paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who ve played the doctor including his predecessor and off screen friend sylvester mccoy who appears once more for the regeneration scene he looks right for the role is brilliant actor and slips effortlessly into the role the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr grace holloway the doctor first companion that he kisses on screen she is not your typical female companion who screams and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor she is tough spunky american and ashbrook shows this well young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee and ve seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end this film included which imho wastes his talent the only problem with the acting is eric roberts one time he had to say to mcgann doctor always dress for the occasion but he broke it up and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like song lyric always dress for the occasion you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act and who also british like mcgann is as the doctor executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role dunno who thought of casting him but if they re reading this news flash eric roberts is not star he rides on his sister coattails and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him is this problem the kisses to the past they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them only whovians would and they re good is it the script or the movie as whole the script is classy piece of work featuring master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue and the movie as whole is one fans will love and it is good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series so what is it simple no plot the master on his last legs sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey but they accidentally land in san francisco 1999 december 31 where the master with young street hood chang lee help opens the eye of harmony which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor with the help of female surgeon dr grace holloway doesn close it by then virtually no plot was told the movie would ve featured the daleks on screen and started with more of courtroom drama between the master and the daleks but lot of rewriting went on on the set that shows how smart people are as it would have made the movie hell of lot more interesting and that would ve gotten four star rating out of me
every year hollywood crowns new it boy young actor pegged for major movie stardom inheriting the mantle from last year winner matthew mcconaughey is matt damon and like mcconaughey he proves to be more than just fresh young face as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release john grisham the rainmaker and good will hunting damon has his first major starring role la mcconaughey in john grisham adaptation in this case francis ford coppola take on the rainmaker damon plays wet behind the ears attorney rudy baylor who immediately after passing the bar exam finds himself representing the mother mary kay place of terminally ill young man john whitworth in big league suit against negligent insurance company while rudy and the film main concern is this case he also finds time to protect young wife claire danes from her abusive husband melrose placer andrew shue in mercifully brief role written for the screen and directed by coppola the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously coppola most notable and effective contribution to the tried and true grisham formula is sense of humor about itself which largely comes in the presence of danny devito as rudy unlicensed co counsel and golden globe nominee jon voight as the insurance company hotshot attorney the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous but danes is as superb as always then of course there is damon who nicely juggles the weighty the insurance case the spousal abuse and the humorous rudy often comical naivete requirements of his role without missing beat as good as he is in the rainmaker damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself damon plays the title character will hunting troubled young construction worker janitor at mit who also happens to be supergenius in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction an mit math professor stellan skarsgard taps his old college friend community college psychologist sean mcguire robin williams to counsel the abrasive standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life good will hunting is the touchy feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon intelligent script touches even though no one and if so _very_ few people can directly relate to will burden of superhuman intelligence the insecurities he suffers are universal the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors williams delivers nice dramatic turn affleck hot up and coming actor himself chasing amy turns up in warm and charming performance as will best friend and the ever appealing minnie driver shines as will harvard schooled love interest the clear standout in the cast though is damon who bravely does not soften will prickly nature but has such natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care for him so many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine but based on his impressive work in john grisham the rainmaker and especially good will hunting it is safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing lot more of in the years to come
mpaa not rated though feel it would likely be pg for martial arts violence with three movies already re released theatrically in america and at least three more on their way jackie chan is one of the newest hot properties in action adventure stardom and it just about time for over twenty five years jackie been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and wonderful sense of comedy drunken master has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to make it big this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong not entirely sure why exactly in many ways drunken master is similar to most of jackie other early films such as fearless hyena and ii master with cracked fingers half loaf of kung fu spiritual kung fu and others in fact looking at all these early films together one gets the impression that they were stamped out cookie cutter style at rate of four to six per year all using the same casts and telling very similar stories to be honest think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste they re quite different from action movies as we know them in america these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together drunken master though its plot is tighter than some is no exception as an aside drunken master was the first jackie chan movie ever saw and saw it the way it was meant to be seen in movie theater in seattle as part of an asian film festival at the time didn really think it was anything special but after having seen more films like it it kind of grown on me drunken master storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies such as fearless hyena and ii and master with cracked fingers slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by harsh seeming master and has big fight with an evil bad guy in the end formula that has been adapted to put it kindly by american films such as karate kid more specifically jackie chan plays the part of wong fei hong aka naughty panther fun loving practical joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good but not _quite_ good enough after embarrassing his instructor assistant by beating him roundly then beating up bully in marketplace wong fei hong tries to hit on pretty girl but discovers that she and her mother can hit back better than he can and is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt respectively his father wong kei ying is unhappy about this and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages kei ying soon institutes harsh regimen of punishment which fei hong does not like at all while escaping from this punishment fei hong meets up with drunken old man who proceeds to thrash him soundly then take him on as student and thrash him some more this turns out to be su hua chi legendary master of drunken style kung fu he assigns fei hong series of bizarre tasks such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from frame cracking walnuts with his hands and other such exercises that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up then when he ready he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu unfortunately the lazy fei hong only practices six of them drunken master features some wonderful martial arts sequences with jackie winning some fights and losing others it been said before but ll say it again these fights don just _happen_ they re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance and it shows in his fights jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment benches jugs cups bowls fruits and vegetables often in new and surprising ways the fight scenes particularly those toward the end of the film are unparallelled in most american films whether jackie wins or loses it really something to see and it often as funny as anything too and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very very good at there very little that new in this movie jackie winning fights jackie getting beaten badly by master jackie going through punishment or training these schticks have all been seen before in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties but they re still hilarious as ever likewise jackie has _great_ supporting cast many of whom were also in other early jackie films and they re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own the really big thing about drunken master though that inspired several copycats including couple starring jackie himself and sequel fifteen years later was the drunken style kung fu not certain whether or not this is actually genuine style of kung fu but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of drunkard to lull the enemy into false sense of security and it apparently helps if you re drunk while you re doing it genuine or not have to admit there just something incredibly fun about watching fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what going on come to think of it perhaps this element is what accounts for this film success over any of the other jackie films it not just martial arts it the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go whoa on the negative side the cinematography in this film is nothing special the film stock is rather primitive the plot is often rather slow and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background gone with the wind this isn still if you like martial arts films or like what you ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more give it shot it much more real than chuck norris or jean claude van damme you might very well like it another interesting thing about drunken master has to do with its video availability in the us drunken master is the only early jackie chan movie that know of that you can find in its original letterboxed hong kong subtitled form commercially available on vhs from magnum video in altin box for about $10 there are plenty of other early jackie films around but these are typically either in dubbed pan and scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase thankfully drunken master at least is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen at very affordable price if you like drunken master take look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there even the dubbed ones aren really _too_ bad if nothing else you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue particularly recommend spiritual kung fu half loaf of kung fu the fearless hyena movies and snake crane arts of shaolin also the mostly unrelated storywise sequel drunken master ii will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year though what its american release title will be is still uncertain and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer also for rather different interpretation of the character wong fei hong who is in fact popular figure from chinese folklore ve been told to suggest the once upon time in china series starring jet li though haven personally seen any of them yet if you choose to watch drunken master really hope you enjoy it and hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that out there all in all give this film an
footloose has only one goal in mind to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel good antics and hate to admit it fell for it the movie is about teenager bacon who moves to small town from the big city and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend lithgow he ends up falling for the preacher daughter singer and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do as mentioned at the beginning of this review footloose is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama there are virtually no surprises and the writing is second rate so why did enjoy it so much for one thing the cast is great kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role we re rooting for him right from the start and unlike most films of this genre bacon doesn play him as the rebel without clue sort yes he does rebel but he also polite when he needs to be and he never broods the rest of the cast is equally impressive john lithgow seen here playing normal guy for change is playing man who would normally be flat out villian but lithgow plays him as concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter by the end of the film we feel genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character another nice touch is the music we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with sexual innuendos but that not true at all the title track performed by kenny loggins is upbeat and fun during the final sequence was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing of course soon realized that would be little pathetic anyway footloose is charming little surprise don let the premise prevent you from watching it it sucked me in and it ll do the same to you
everyone knows someone like giles de ath stuffy arrogant set in his ways and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with progress giles is writer but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis his house looks like an immaculate museum with no television microwave word processor or other technological gadgets only the electric lights betray that he living in the twentieth century not the nineteenth this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into flat stereotype but john hurt in what is certainly his best performance in decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career turns erstwhile fogy giles into three dimensional human being despite his tunnel vision it impossible not to like the man especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune love and as giles discovers during the course of this amusing warm hearted motion picture it possible to find the object of one affection in the most unusual places giles who is widower and recluse does not frequent the cinema but when he learns that an forster film is playing at the local theater he screws up his courage and decides to go what he doesn realize is that the movie house is showing two films the forster adaptation and teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii nonplused giles ends up sitting in darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress just as giles is about to leave however he notices ronnie bostock jason priestley and suddenly it love at first sight giles is enraptured and the moment hotpants college ii is over he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia including teen magazines and video tapes in order to watch those tapes giles must buy vcr but he initially doesn realize that he needs tv to use the vcr eventually not satisfied with being the world foremost authority on bostock giles boards plane and travels to long island where his idol home is located bostock is away when giles arrives but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie supermodel girlfriend audrey fiona loewi eventually the actor arrives home and impressed with giles demeanor and intelligence he begins to rely on the older man advice but while giles affection runs deep ronnie feelings are less constant love and death on long island is comedy and very funny one at that in fact for its first half the film is nearly perfect it suffers fall off once giles reaches new york and the ending with its none too subtle homosexual overtones is little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom writer director richard kwietniowski adapting from the novel by gilbert adair is 100% on target in the process he not only creates truly likable and memorable character in giles but says few things about the transforming power of love even if it is unrequited from start to finish this is clearly hurt movie he in almost every frame it role that the veteran actor must have relished because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure and does so by means of dialogue delivery body language and ever changing facial expressions jason priestley cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie he is charismatic and it not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie meanwhile solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always reliable maury chaykin love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one social commentary it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment buddy picture love story ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on movie screen these days and fish out of water tale victorian relic giles forced into the modern world yet despite the many laughs love and death offers it never takes cheap shots it has vibrant beating heart and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile
call it touched by demon gregory hoblit fallen is serial killer movie with an unusual horrific twist if marketed properly this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven in fact there even little twin peaks to be found here albeit with the lion share of the weirdness distilled out remember bob the biggest failing of fallen is that although it consistently interesting it not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope serial killer elias koteas has been on the loose in philadephia but detective john hobbes denzel washington the noblest man on the police force has brought him to justice now during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes what goes around really goes around shortly thereafter he begins to sing time is on my side as he taken on his last walk minutes later the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead but for hobbes the nightmare is just beginning because reese wasn normal psychopath he was the host body for mythical dark angel named azazel and with reese death azazel is free to hop from body to body murdering and wreaking havoc at will only hobbes and pretty female theology teacher embeth davidtz have an inkling of what they re up against the rest of the cops including hobbes partner jonesy john goodman lou james gandolfini newcomer to the department and lieutenant stanton donald sutherland don have clue and as result they are in mortal danger as depicted by hoblit primal fear and cinematographer newton thomas sigel philadelphia is dark dreary place gothic city rather than modern one no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown the most famous landmark to appear isn the liberty bell or independence hall it geno steaks shadows and night scenes abound the days are cloudy and unpromising this is the kind of setting where it easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men fallen plot is brimming with potential not all of which is realized somehow would have expected more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise but the level of terror like that of gore is kept in check nevertheless there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks the film also boasts chase sequence of kind that can best be described as unusual of the several dozen actors to play azazel the best is by far elias koteas exotica crash who despite only being on screen for about ten minutes gives fantastically charged performance john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of burly sidekick sadly however these two are the only ones who excel everyone else including denzel washington is boring washington flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film it not that he bad per se but he not very interesting there no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character and that keeps us distanced however slightly from hobbes as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop and as his life or death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate expected to be more on the edge of my seat than was washington subdued approach is part of the reason for this never felt sense of urgency however at least washington was believable which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz schindler list and donald sutherland to be fair the flaws in their characters aren all acting related neither stanton nor gretta milano are well written that said however there nothing inspired about either davidtz or sutherland work both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing multi dimensional individual narratively fallen has few glaring weaknesses although the plot proceeds with convoluted game like structure it uses denzel washington supplied voiceover to overexplain matters at times this is actually helpful and it has use beyond the obvious but there are occasions when ponderous lines like like the night sometimes you come face to face with yourself become little hard to swallow in addition fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel however despite the negatives still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending which loved the final scenes are startling audacious and unexpected it not often that plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did at time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself this is not great motion picture but considering how bad most january releases are it reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours and whatever you do don walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll
think that any competent member of the human race who ever seen movie any movie could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer even though try very hard to not predict films as watching them especially not romantic comedies the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds and sometimes minutes before actually saw it happen on screen but don care not even little my reasons for this are simple adam sandler is great drew barrymore is great the movie is so funny there are parts that left me gasping for air because was laughing so hard haven laughed this hard in movie since austin powers sandler plays robby hart wedding singer who once had dreams of being in rock band and writing his own music in the opening scenes he seems like happy go lucky wedding singer at least partially enjoying his profession and doing rather good job of talking down really drunk individual steve buscemi who decides that his brother wedding is good place to tell the whole world that his life up to that point was utter pointlessness week later at his own wedding he is left standing at the altar by his ex fianc linda angela featherstone with his life in complete disarray he meets julia barrymore waitress she is engaged to glenn matthew glave and is to marry him in about three months julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans soon and predictably it becomes pretty clear that glenn is jerk and that robby and julia really love each other oh sure it trite and if anyone making this film expected us to like feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer then they truly underestimated their audience what makes the story bearable aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music are the performances barrymore is simply adorable here ve never seen her look so close to the way she did in et not only is she pleasant to look at but her acting job here really is good one and it doesn hurt that the character is likable and adequately well written and the jerk played in full force by graves is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy ve ever seen naturally the true star here is sandler think the guy is flat out hilarious he can say something that just isn funny and his delivery makes me laugh his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can indeed hold his own as leading man in romantic comedy whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler the wedding singer gives him character that for the first time he actually has to fit into as far as concerned he succeeded and this film is testimony that he does in fact have some range in his talents and the movie is just so funny perhaps the best moment is when he sings song for julia that he claims is little uneven because he began writing it while in good mood and finished it after his fianc abandoned him this is the part that literally had me groping for breath of air and while the film like all romantic comedies takes hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren very important the film is predicable but who cares the characters are extremely likable the movie is ridiculously funny and the experience is simply enjoyable in addition to this can imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film in that order conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review just want everyone to know that laughed lot
it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing child whether that may be in life or in death after having said that will also say that this movie does all of the above very well one gets that choking sensation in the throat because of grief when one brother forgives another for costly mistake or when husband hugs his wife after long estrangement there is no ocean no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another ordinary people in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing not that this literally happened in the movie so what are the lessons learnt don take your children to class reunions don leave them alone in the lobby not even for second michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of highly strung wife and mother trend that started with thousand acres and one fine day my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie so much so that when she has nervous break down the veins on her temples bulge impressively whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance playing lesbian cop with name that makes one want to reach for lollipop lastly who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie my grandmother comes to mind
capsule short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg joe johnston directs straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs it lets us see some new dinosaurs is that an oxymoron and gives us nice and generally reasonably written adventure the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious had good time low +2 to +4 here goes my credibility this is film on which expect to be in minority liked the third jurassic park film even liked the second jurassic park film in lot of ways jurassic park the lost world was creative three way braiding together of michael crichton novel the lost world arthur conan doyle novel the lost world and the classic silent film version of the doyle jp2 was an adventure as doyle said for the boy who half man or the man who half boy that is what all the jurassic park films are expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon mines had under written characters also jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs the characters are little more complex than they at first appear to be and even that is little more complex than was expecting some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as require feel got my money worth the story opens with eric played by trevor morgan and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park they hope no doubt to get look at the island dinosaurs from safe height the height is safe but driving the boat in the water is not the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant sam neill in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as guide he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go doing the convincing is wealthy and eccentric couple william macy and tea leoni who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs they too plan to see the island from safe height grant is relieved to learn he will fly over this island at safe altitude just this once right guess what happens next jp3 probably functions better as sequel than jp2 first it has alan grant and ellie sattler laura dern back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm sattler has much smaller part in jp3 but is still present to tie this story to the first curiously each film seems to arrange to have signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films of course these raptors look little different also so perhaps they are different related species not only are they more intelligent than in the past films they are also more sympathetic in this story they are not just killing machines they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition this time around they may be little too anthropomorphized each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs of course in this film major threat is from spinosaurus not as common or as popularly known as tyrannosaurus but larger and presumably more nasty it has crocodile head and the body that looks like dimetrodon walking upright perhaps as an economy measure or just to create mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs sometimes they just move too fast to see occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision few times we get unconvincing matte shot particularly of the laboratory but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams score for the first film joe johnston who directs already has to his credit two very good films recommend the rocketeer and october sky team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay the film they have made is long way from great cinema but it still is fun if you get thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today the film is for you rate it on the to 10 scale and low +2 on the to +4 scale
andrew lloyd webber musicals preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice present musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as oklahoma or the slapstickness of shows like funny thing happened on the way to the forum they instead tackle hot issues from our past and view them differently and pack them together with redundant catchy music as well as thoughtful lyrics like jesus christ superstar which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from fame perspective in the cool tune superstar dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn spread his message wider evita takes an inventive stance on its topic this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator juan per eva who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention much like the woman playing her madonna although think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent among other things evita deals with the rise and fall of eva per woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan jonathan pryce then died at the young age of 33 creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di the two do share bit in common although it wasn like di slept to the top webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals but they always have point for doing it here they wish to expose her for what she is but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks her lying and covering up for her fascist husband but show that she was still good woman with fairly good intentions and her death was very sad it also musical with almost no words not unsung the film plays like rock opera much like their jesus christ superstar with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience but also very entertaining one after all this is musical and webber musicals never undermine this they are balance of energy and intellectual depth walking on fine line between the both and never stumbling on either side this is why the beginning of evita is kind of let down okay it is let down not saying the opening moments are bad because they re pretty good but what comes after is lifeless un entertaining and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons singer jimmy nail into taking eva to buenos aires after one night stand in the musical it fun energetic sequence culiminating in the show stopper buenos aires which is also lifeless then punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer instead of her leaving him where she ends up singing the sad tune another suitcase in another hall which was meant for later character screwed over by eva the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft seeming like parker and oliver stone who adapted it for the screen are afraid to present her for what she is even while it being narrated by hater of eva the omnipotent antonio banderas who presents her in negative light for while it looks like alan parker can pull it off however the film pulls itself together in flash and after that song is over and the giddily nihilistic song goodbye and thank you where we see eva go through long line of lovers who help her ascend is magnificent darkly comical and just gleeful from this point on the film is hypnotic satisfying and satirical no more punches are thrown and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact we see eva woo and marry juan get him out of jail rise to stardom falter bit come back and then gradually die of cancer think it was because of cancer more importantly many of the themes from the musical carry on with this as well as some filling in the gaps reconnassaince work juan who is pretty underwritten in the musical is given some extra scenes and exposed as what he was for eva an accessory muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan and understand his sadness more than we did before >from the goodbye and thank you number on the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed nation and saved government even while it left the nation people downtrodden but despite this the nation still loved eva and when she slipped into death the world mourned her because she was star that when our narrator ch comes out to show that she wasn the great woman she really was and expose her fame describing this character is difficult mainly because he has no real realistic background he said to be based on the revolutionary ch guevera but the two probably could have never met like they do in the film but he serves as perspective on eva but even his perspective can help us from feeling bad when eva dies pathetic death alan parker no stranger to bizarre musicals he done fame the committments bugsy malone and pink floyd the wall the latter which is absolutely brilliant nails the film exposing everything for what it is we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should by the way it is presented his direction is manipulative for reason to show the mourning for what it is and there is energy throughout with lots of bright colors and scenes which are cinematically entertaning as well as enriching and deep such as the balcony scene where she sings don cry for me argentina and her death sequence which is poignant becuase of how sad it is madonna golden globe winning performance is much like the movie starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly remaning there for the rest of the film at the beginning she looks like she too busy concentrating on her singing to act but she eventually gets it right though never really getting the presence of say patti lupone who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s her death though is brilliant her singing could be better though know she took lessons to improve her range and all but it still sounds like she trying to hard she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding like patti lupone heard her sing on an old evita cd and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her but it generally very good although not up to the brilliance the role really requires antonio banderas who is almost like guilty pleasure these days one of the few people who thinks he rocks is extremely comanding in his performance presenting lovable narrator his singing is very good though nothing compared to the original mandy patinkin he does have pretty good singing voice and great range and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome although very brief at times in his role as juan seeming to put on poker face for his melancholy facade although it gets off to rocky start rocky polite for what it really is it soon picks up and becomes wonderully poignant musical like the other musical released in 96 woody allen everyone says love you it reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead but it can come back every now and then for brief performance
there more to quilt than fabric and thread each patchwork design has its own unique story or stories to tell in how to make an american quilt the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse proof we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality all the sorrows joys longings sufferings and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and as their bittersweet memories are given expression one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals how to make an american quilt presents distinctly feminine alternative the quilting bee consists of seven members sisters gladys ann bancroft and hy ellen burstyn sophia lois smith woman known for frightening children emma jean simmons the timid wife of perpetually unfaithful man constance kate nelligan who has been having an affair with emma husband anna maya angelou the leader of the group and marianna alfre woodard anna daughter the project they re busy with is the wedding quilt for hy granddaughter finn winona ryder who has just become engaged she spending the summer with hy and gladys and away from her fiance to decide whether lifelong commitment is really what she wants and whether it better to marry friend or lover one of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast from winona ryder ann bancroft ellen burstyn and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn claire danes and kate capshaw this film is overflowing with realized talent the performances are good enough in fact to cover up many of the script weaknesses how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable if affecting tale of love across the generations sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club with dash of fried green tomatoes added there are probably too many characters so instead of really getting to know few of them we are presented with quick glimpses into single defining event in each of their lives we learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible there are other episodes as well the love of anna life marianna soul mate and look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend husband the sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn story whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with hunky stranger there is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt the stories are all well told but it difficult to really connect with the characters their moments pass so quickly while we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals our emotional investment is tenuous there isn enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way and many of the personalities and relationships feel half formed like quilt with patches missing to put it bluntly while enjoyed watching this film it didn do much for me on the whole how to make an american quilt is nicely understated drama that has lot to say about love passion and monogamy in relationships finn segment is by far the most compelling because she the focal point her actions are shaped by everyone else experiences the other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees if there disappointment here it that the script doesn have more resonance but the privilege of seeing such fine cast in top form allows viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional
in recent years harrison ford has been such grave screen presence scowling through the likes of tom clancy jack ryan series _the_fugitive_ and last year smash _air_force_one_ that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such superstar had been completely drained from his system apparently it was just lying dormant with ivan reitman enjoyable romantic comedy adventure _six_days _seven_nights_ the lovable scoundrel is back giving audiences fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons ford plays quinn harris carefree and slightly slobby endearingly so pilot in the tropics whose broken down plane crashes in storm stranding him and his charter new york magazine editor robin monroe anne heche on deserted island of course the sophisticated robin and the salt of the earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting while some of the lines fall flat the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche both actors who have largely done serious works as of late seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders and they deliver their zingers as weak as they sometimes are with beguiling abandon naturally there nothing like life threatening crisis to bring two people together and quinn and robin warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates granted some conflict needed to be introduced on the island but this tacked on development from writer michael browning is bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes but the point is to get the two together and their newfound affection causes complications for both but mostly robin who came to the islands on vacation with her fiance frank david schwimmer who frantically awaits her return on the home island reitman and old reliable hand at breezy comedies keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action oriented sequences his big accomplishment however is bringing the old smiling ford back as appealing and charismatic as he always is ford hasn been quite this charming and affable in years he obviously having blast and the audience cannot help but have one along with him holding her own is heche whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be as the plane goes down she frantically pops stress pills she can take her lumps physical and otherwise just as well as quinn making her formidable foil and ideal match formulaic and light as feather _six_days _seven_nights_ could be cited as classic example of the summer popcorn movie season lack of substance it certainly fluff but it unpretentious undemanding and most importantly fun fluff that goes down as easily as frothy pina colada on balmy tropical beach pass the popcorn
jack nicholson has funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities but whom you end up liking anyway in as good as it gets the character in question is melvin udall successful novelist with obsessive compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible except when he feels like being royal pain in the you know where he mean mean really mean the opening scene shows him shoving little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium every day melvin eats at the same cafe sits at the same table and gets served by the same waitress you can tell that this is his favorite place to be vicious nuisance when his waitress carol helen hunt tells him he can just go sit in another section and all the other waitresses just cringe one day melvin makes comment that goes to far and carol genuinely hurt comes down on him like ton of bricks at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as matter of course but is also the only person who can get to him too another person who often crosses melvin sights is simon greg kinnear an artist who lives on melvin floor aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city simon has the added benefit of being gay making him prime target simon friend frank cuba gooding jr also gay does not fare much better when simon walks in on pair of men robbing his apartment he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital and frank who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor intimidates melvin into watching after simon dog while he convalesces this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in melvin gets to like the dog and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin softening up to the world around him it doesn happen overnight but throughout the film he bites his tongue here cares little there and most miraculously falls in love one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others he traveling terra incognita here and it shows good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film especially by nicholson and hunt they play well off of each other and have genuine chemistry which makes it pleasure to watch them on screen greg kinnear who is becoming known for his supporting film roles is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon he gives short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels cuba gooding jr performs with hyped up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear and comes through with near constant comic performance the screenplay by mark andrus and james brooks is clever touching and funny the best part about it however is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting melvin is man we can quite figure out but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention carol is working woman living with her mother trying to take care of child with debilitating respiratory problem simon is man who is success in his circle of peers but who is still not accepted by much of society combined with the talent of the actors these characters make the film the one noticeable area where the film is lacking however is the absence of cuba gooding jr through the second half his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary but the film ends before his return leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved would have liked to have seen more of his character in general in addition to part in the film conclusion there one actor who will probably not be recognized by any awards but who contributes greatly to many of the movie best scenes and who deserves mention this is that little dog he plays such pivotal role to melvin character development actually serves to forward the plot and has some absolutely scene stealing moments that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal award or no however when even the dog puts in good performance you know you ve got an outstanding movie
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned on december 20 1996 amidst all the year end oscar bait releases from the major studios miramax genre label dimension films quietly released sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream although the teen horror market had been given up for all but dead in recent years the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history while delighting audiences by finally presenting set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry suddenly everybody was looking for hip inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given boost scream director wes craven previously best known as the creator of new line nightmare on elm street film series was thrust back into the limelight and scream rookie scribe kevin williamson burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion it hard to understate this last point mr williamson has based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing scream know what you did last summer from october 1997 and now scream enjoyed meteoric rise to fame quickly become the most well known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly reading box office figure watching youth culture since well since that quentin tarantino guy whom it is said has also achieved some renown as director indeed in singularly freakish oddity it is the screenwriter mr williamson and not the director that has been receiving the lion share of acclaim for the success of scream and the print advertisements for scream theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence while the traditional film by wes craven drapes the film title in the ads right below it in equal sized font yet reads written by kevin williamson an affirmation of the screenwriter contribution to the project which may be unprecedented can envision the board of wga licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of film by is attained and much like mr tarantino screenwriting mr williamson work is vaguely unconventional incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters in scream they satirically discussed other horror films here in the sequel the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood and mr williamson rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel while the sequel was planned from the outset treatment of scream was included when mr williamson sold the screenplay for scream the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived and it only at about the film midway point when it becomes engaging like its predecessor scream opens with splashy eye grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film principal narrative this time around we re following the exploits of young couple jada pinkett and omar epps attending riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab running film within film gag where the true life events behind the first film has been turned into movie however although it tries hard and has some good ideas the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one was sharing the theatre with and was certainly thinking about gutting the overly noisy person few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes the prologue is pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore where her performance not only convinced me that she could act but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in horror film that ve ever seen there are too many knowing hip pop culture references crammed into the scream sequence and the setup isn nearly as cleverly frightening as scream while the first film preface dizzyingly built up to final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying the payoff here is almost campily theatrical flash to the campus of smalltown ohio college where returning characters sidney neve campbell and randy jamie kennedy have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors single minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers courteney cox roars into town to cover the breaking story while ever awkward former deputy dewey riley david arquette flies in to protectively guard over sidney they re joined by cotton weary liev schreiber who was falsely accused of homicide in cameo appearance during the first film his role here is significantly expanded the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory although suppose good case can be made that it really isn necessary not because so many people have seen the first installment but because this is after all sequel to slasher film what do you think happened to these characters in the prior movie there lot of new faces on the scene too sidney new boyfriend derek jerry connell and her new roommate hallie elise neal randy fellow film student mickey timothy olyphant gale newly assigned nervous cameraman joel duane martin omnipresent local journalist debbie salt laurie metcalf co ed cici cooper ms buffy herself sarah michelle gellar and pair of simpering sorority sisters rebecca gayheart and sirens portia di rossi any of these characters could be the killer or for that matter could be the next victim as is seemingly becoming regular staple of kevin williamson screenplay the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly flimsy premise of whodunit one problem that scream didn have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer here and to some extent in know what you did last summer mr williamson screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into mystery the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop kirmizi herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements it doesn help matters any that the killer alter ego is fairly obvious from the get go indeed the finale plays as full out camp when the villain is finally unmasked frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations scheming and motivation that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived the aspect where it head and shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences they re staged much more imaginatively here save for the first post prologue murder which is handled in such mediocre conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized and are much more fun to watch it hard to hold back smile during giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from car wreck and cat and mouse chase involving gale and dewey in campus sound lab is very nicely staged although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown in terms of its characters the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of perceived aura of incompetency is well written and there curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed on the other hand sidney is pretty dull here she doesn have any compelling presence and there nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she the returning heroine given this and the fact that there no strong second banana character for sidney elise neal role isn nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan shoes it no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film what surprises me the most about scream is its zealousness in decimating its cast the film mounting body count bears out the fact that no character is safe well almost while in principal applaud this bold policy at some point you ve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular whose casting for the next installment of the series would ve seemed obvious but hey as rose mcgowan character said in the first film no please don kill me mr ghostface want to be in the sequel look what that got her
contact is the 1997 movie ve seen the most five times to be exact four of those times were on the big screen but even on tv it very impressive film the same can be said for films like independance day but that because contact is rare example in sci fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects and all of us know looking back that id4 didn offer much outside of some one time delightful eye candy contact wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway jodie foster radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of merely listening to sounds out in space her interest in the field of astronomy developed at very young age encouraged by her loving father ted david morse who let ellie use small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola fl that was of course before the days of internet chat rooms while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra terrestrial intelligence of which the program seti is an acronym for ellie prefers to pop on pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive ellie strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young in puerto rico she meets palmer joss matthew mcconaughey writer examining the effects of technology on the world overall happiness one time seminary student who describes himself as man of the cloth without the cloth despite the vast differences in opinion regarding supreme being ellie and palmer hit it off and even take the time to sleep together it weak and hurried relationship but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on meanwhile dr david drumlin tom skerritt who has authority over seti but finds the program frivolous waste of time and money is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors eventually finding setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation and only one night stand to remember it is in this nm city where several months later ellie finally picks up on strong signal from outer space perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science when the signal is closely examined many new developments spring up and before long drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at eventually it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega where the signal seems to have originated the media swarms fanatics go further off the deep end scientists clamor for new information politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take and presidents are morphed into celluloid reality remember when zemeckis couldn get enough of this in forrest gump as if that weren enough ellie discovery leads her to the nation capital where she again runs into palmer contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs religion the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented with no signs of bias arguments for both sides are intelligent solid and thought provoking when palmer joins selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega of which ellie is leading candidate personal convictions play more important role than love interests the question is can person who doesn believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet does believe in higher power even when the film wraps up it uncertain whether it meant to play as an advocate for religion science both or even neither and in our modern day society where right and wrong is only opinion at least speaking politically correctly the ambiguity is an incentive don get me wrong as much as it sounds like it contact isn merely theology class rolled into reel of film it highly enjoyable two and half hours despite its seemingly heavy issues it not tedious undertaking to watch this film the special effects are outstanding though warning highly depreciated on the small screen even so some of the subtle visual effects that will likely go unnoticed by many are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as sci fi the storytelling is rich and complete and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious and at times even hokey it easily one of the best 1997 films and one of the best sci fi films ve ever seen this is zemeckis best since back to the future and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated zemeckis now has real reason to boast
don know what movie the critics saw but it wasn this one the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring in my personal opinion they couldn be more wrong if you were expecting airplane like laughs and agatha christie intense mystery then yes this movie would be disappointment however if you re just looking for an enjoyable movie and good time this is one to see honest it is this story is about 4th network wbn taking to america airwaves in 1939 penny henderson mary stuart masterson the station owner secretary must deal with her overbearing boss an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on moment notice partly due to the fact that they haven been paid in weeks among the mayhem she must also deal with her soon to be ex husband roger brian benben who desperately wants her back unfortunately her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation while trying to woo penny back roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny trying to be unbiased so won tell you how amazing she looked although brian benben gets most of the screen time along with the two leads are several recognizable faces including corbin bernsen law michael mckean laverne shirley and bobcat goldthwait the special effects are amazing and fooled me which some may argue isn very difficult to do in many scenes although the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie overall gave it or an depending on what system you use some comments collected from friends
no it is not bad film in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose actually wished for the film to end itself quickly event horizon is not your run of the mill sci fi film sure many who have watched this will agree with me it is not even original in that sense and it does borrow heavily from films like alien hellraiser and even blade runner the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build up that makes it wonderfully horrifying the story brings us to the year 2050 where space travel have since enormously progressed the event horizon is actually ship built for secret experimental purpose it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in man lifetime the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after years it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune search and rescue team led by miller fishburne is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon the designer of the ship dr weir neill follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship event horizon is sci fi horror film much truer to the word than say alien would ever be while in alien the crew has to cope with ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces in event horizon the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb up till the point where really felt like saying out loud `enough can stand this anymore there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also the acting is only at most average by most commercial standards even so the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film thanks to its well paced storytelling disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences which incidentally has been quite generously removed by our censorship board director paul anderson who did mortal kombat and his team of `atmosphere creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror this picture did not do very well in the us box office most probably for the dread factor impact it has on most audiences people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this although on the face of it event horizon is mostly molded for mass entertainment many thrills spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus however the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing my friend and could not say word to each other for quite while after going through the `experience of event horizon guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us be forewarned this film is not for the faint hearted nor for pure entertainment be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film event horizon is highly recommended but at your own risk it has been long time since good horror embraced the big screen and event horizon is one
bob the happy bastard quickie review rush hour so what the problem with 48 hours clones these days they always try for the same thing that eddie murphy and nick nolte had that was the problem that plagued these clones not to mention the actual sequel another 48 hours complete waste of film but at last someone has different take on the matter and it director brett rainer rush hour features jackie chan in his first action movie playing chinese detective who being flown to the us to investigate the kidnapping of the chinese consulate daughter of course the fbi is upset that he ll be interfering in their investigation and stick him with an lapd office with big mouth of course that chris tucker what makes rush hour work so damn well is the chemistry between the energetic chan and the absolutely hilarious tucker tucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity michael jackson you tito and chan delivers few zingers of his own as well as some terrific fight scenes the story pretty much your average fare but with decent twist involving the main villain highly clouded figure named jun tao at least it entertaining and the concept is excellently realized particular fight scene in chinese office where chan and tucker duke it out with the bad guys is funny and energetic at the same time and the finale real treat as well chan delivers yet another fantastic stunt for the fans with 10 story drop rush hour is just the sort of film you ll get kick out of on any night of the week just make sure you don look for anything culturally different and you ll be fine drunken master ii this ain
when you go to the movies as much as do you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times such was the case with frequency every time went to screening there was the frequency preview it looked awful it looked cheesy sappy and ridiculous it looked like flop well whoever put that trailer together should be fired because in terms of pure entertainment frequency is one of the best of the year thus far frequency boasts compelling story line an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan james caviezel to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan dennis quaid through ham radio despite the fact that frank has been dead for 30 years john is able to give his father information that prevents his death in warehouse fire but by doing so causes other changes somehow serial killer reign of terror which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders extends to ten victims including john mother this is director gregory hoblit third film the other two being primal fear and fallen with all three he managed to attach himself to great scripts this one by toby emmerich whose only previous movie experience was as music supervisor on numerous new line films and add equally great direction also he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with kick ass ending frequency is no exception the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying hoblit is three for three and hope he can keep it up now everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the sci fi elements of frequency but the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved who to say how something works and how it doesn when it never happened is it because we ve become accustomed to time travel laws from other places like star trek and the back to the future trilogy and quantum leap yes if you sit down and think about it certain plot elements in this film probably won make any sense most films are like that don let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however when frequency was over it made me wish had seen it with my father so could have given him hug okay okay shut up when you break it down past all its sci fi elements and serial killer antics frequency is simply movie about father and his son and the bond that they share it touching it sincere and it what ultimately makes this movie work [pg 13]
it must be tough to be mob boss just ask paul vitti robert deniro man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing can believe it too one can even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when he forced to choose between an ice pick baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with suffering from reoccurring panic attacks paul decides he needs to consult some professional help and who better than billy crystal after appearing in bottom of the barrel flops father day and my giant crystal finally finds reliable costar and some very promising material here playing vitti private shrink the two very different stars strike an unorthodox but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on steady wave of laughs from start to finish casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in joke think placed in this mobster shoes deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather part ii and casino it obvious he having lot of fun doing so the man behind the camera is harold ramis whose credits include ghostbusters as writer and star and his best directing effort the bill murray vehicle groundhog day ramis has knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows what funny and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors the only character who weakens the payoff is crystal bride to be lisa kudrow playing the same dumbed down role as she does in friends kudrow is amusing but doesn fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped the supporting cast sparkles joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly vitti pea brained right hand man and chazz palminteri is show stopper playing fellow mobster who in desperate need of the definition of `closure the movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout putting the emphasis on or really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides the situation is just too cute to resist it unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand but hey if you re in the mafia using obscenities probably comes naturally and near the end seeing billy crystal attempt to walk and talk like mob boss is truly special treat
when saw the trailer for the sixth sense didn expect much from it my snap judgment was that it was watered down version of the shining or possibly late entry in the glut of angel related movies tv shows of couple years ago but all the buzz motivated me to give it shot it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe at the beginning of the movie he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work but he is soon confronted by vincent patient malcolm failed years earlier donnie wahlberg former new kid in an impressive cameo year passes and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed cole sear haley joel osment is withdrawn kid who is called freak by the other boys in the neighborhood weird things seem to happen around cole his mother olivia williams leaves the kitchen for moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn moved and cole seems to know things that kid his age shouldn for example that there was once gallows in his school he steals religious icons from churches to build chapel in pup tent in his bedroom the trailer gave away the movie first major plot twist if it hadn the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn know what wrong with cole if you re lucky enough to have not seen the trailer stop reading this review right now and go see the sixth sense anyway since the trailer gave it away figure it fair game to discuss here once malcolm gains cole trust cole reveals his secret he sees ghosts everywhere dead people wander around not knowing that they re dead invisible to everyone except cole malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth the box office success of the sixth sense has generated lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that so hate to burst anybody bubble but the sixth sense isn really horror film at its core the sixth sense is touching story of how troubled kid and an emotionally scarred adult help each other to move past their problems some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy though one that really got to me the ghost of boy says to cole ll show you where my dad keeps his gun when the ghost turns we see the bullet wound in the back of his head osment gives the best performance ve ever seen from child actor it hard enough to find grown up in hollywood who can give subtle realistic portrayal although willis gets top billing cole is really the protagonist of the story and osment truly brings the complex kid to life if only willis work were as impressive accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm his most challenging role to date this is bad omen for his next movie the story of us which chronicles the ups and downs of marriage writer director night shyamalan has light poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite he also skillful storyteller as the movie ending demonstrates only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie look for cameo by the director as doctor who treats cole bottom line osment should get an oscar nomination and you should go see this movie
six days seven nights is summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare here genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it fluff recognizes it fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff of course the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays sizeable part in the movie success ford is such concentrated dramatic actor that it easy to forget what funny guy he can be as his female counterpart anne heche also deserves big pat on the back for her sweet goofily charismatic performance the age difference ford 56 heche 29 matters not these two click in charged way that hard to come by the story is no brainer ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris while heche is career minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe robin on tropical vacation with fianc frank david schwimmer gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there the plane crashes during terrible storm and they immediately find themselves stuck in deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization series of unpleasant often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other meanwhile back at the resort frank is tempted himself by quinn shapely female tagalong jacqueline obradors that subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn robin pairing and while it makes for few good laughs early on it eventually becomes contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin and since the film spends most of its time with the castaways this flaw is only minor inconvenience director ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk at slim 101 minutes six days seven nights never wears out its welcome where lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title michael browning clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable one liners my favorite taken in context is you mean _arrrgh_ pirates and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another they re all quite engaging even the movie more serious moments are played with wink heche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the believability of six days seven nights heterosexual pairing so she lesbian so what deal with it of course it doesn and here her naysayers are proved wrong in big way in fact her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click these opposites attract with the utmost endearing electricity at one point when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest heche asks ford how old he is after several wrong guesses forty five _fifty_ he whispers his age to her you still look good heche stammers still _am_ good ford replies she good too and together they make six days seven nights one memorable ride
curdled is deliciously dark and witty siyah comedy but its humour won appeal to everyone to be specific let me give you an example do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny don see curdled on the other hand if you found that sequence to be pretty funny you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at our film heroine gabriela played by angela jones is woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers she even keeps scrapbook of news articles luckily for her miami is being plagued by serial killer rampage her scrapbook is getting pretty big the killer nickname in the press is the mavi blood killer because he preys on older rich socialite women and he played by william baldwin this is not spoiler one particularly striking on the mavi blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests she immediately quits her job and signs on with pfcs which stands for post forensic cleaning service no points for guessing what they do her workmates are confused by gabriela fascination with murder to them it just day job there hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk and what they would say gabriela partner elena played by mel gorham is particularly perturbed by gabriela wide eyed fascination and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the mavi blood killer latest scene they re the messiest you see unbeknownst to them the last victim left something on the scene which would id the mavi blood killer so he also heading over there the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental quentin tarantino executive produced this film which began life as short film he saw at film festival apparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into feature length film there are other parallels the star of curdled is angela jones the top billing goes to william baldwin but really jones is the central character who probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos the death obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction that role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film curdled jr jones is great in curdled she wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character innocence or likeability she can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow it great performance reb braddock direction is extremely sharp and clever toeing the line between siyah humour and bad taste the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing any more than that would be spoiler the opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing of course it impossible to really take this stuff seriously but then again you re not really supposed to braddock knows the audience is in on the joke and makes it fun little romp as result the one drawback of curdled is that it was based on short film and it feels like it the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill feature length running time and some parts just seem to drag while its running time is already short 94 minutes it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing curdled seems destined to be nice cult film for miramax it ll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well
most people fit into two different categories you either love woody allen or you hate his guts my family for the most part hates him and his movies think he very funny but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of unrestrained by physical boundaries allen humor comes shining through those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen intelligent observations of life those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one in 1995 film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they never seen before toy story used state of the art computer technology and presented world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present many critics will call that better film but believe they only say that because it was completely original motion picture antz however has upped the ante considerably disney bug life isn due out for another two months and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal by beating disney out they have satisfied the audience thirst for computer animated films but don let that fool you disney is definitely not scared in the past two years competitions have broken out between studios in 1997 it was the volcano duel in my opinion dante peak came out way ahead of its predecessor both in time and in quality volcano had an original premise but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations in 1998 there are twice as many competing films first was the comet competition and armageddon blew away it cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact but now it even more interesting as one beloved studio disney goes up against the newcomer dreamworks who will prevail time will tell but sure that mr mouse has nothing to fear this may sound like didn like antz on the contrary put it up there with toy story but due to it pg rating many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn appear in disney version some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for family oriented film sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally which makes dreamworks animated feature geared more for an adult crowd the humor is also written especially for adults though many kids were laughing in the theater attended this is the type of film that should be made for families more often entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents antz begins with hilarious monologue which seems meld between woody allen shtick and franz kafka metamorphosis the short story of man who wakes up to discover himself as bug allen is troubled ant believing he was not made to be worker when you re the middle child in family of five million he comments about his neglected childhood one night is sitting in bar with his friend weaver sylvester stallone discussing his pathetic place in life in walks princess bala sharon stone whom no one recognizes without crown bala asks is he would like to dance and they engage in pulp fiction esque dance while everyone else is following the leader after discovering that she is the princess falls in love but there problem bala is getting married to general mandible gene hackman ruthless leader who merely wants to control better and stronger colony in order to do that he must eliminate not only the queen anne bancroft but the weakest of the colony namely the worker ants but to get rid of the queen he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her he and colonel cutter christopher walkin come up with plan to send the loyal ants off to battle where they will surely be killed the queen is reluctant at first but decides it is best for the colony meanwhile wants to meet bala again and he asks weaver an army ant to switch places with him so gets sent off to battle but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites the battle sequence is absolutely stunning though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers which contained very similar sequence however antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time so the similarities are merely coincidence the second half of the film revolves around kidnapping of bala and their search for mythical place called insectopia there an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants the adventures and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension especially one involving magnifying glass looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day in fact just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally the ants look up in awe and then beam of fire blasts into the ground visually it an exciting rush of adrenaline but don be fooled little kids shouldn see this as they may just try and copy it after seeing antz vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again hopefully children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel as an animated film antz is probably the best you will find to date visually it as stunning as what dreams may come the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren limited by gravity they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible one great moment involves mass of worker ants bunching up to form wrecking ball the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball however the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of young boy shoe it truly great example of film making at its finest with computer technology the animators have carefully made the ants faces look similar to the actors providing the voices the best example would have to be barbatus danny glover at one point you can even see the pores on his face although doubt ants have pores do they barbatus also has touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with without body young kids may be disturbed by the site of dismembered head but good deal of humor is derived more appropriate for adults of course disney bug life looks good but don know if they will be able to best dreamworks newest animated feature in terms of animation if not then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do go head to head with the big mouse and knock him down yes anastasia was good but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature and antz has one of the best line ups seen since toy story in fact it far exceeds that one woody allen has always been funny but here he transcends most of what he done in the past few years without body his comic timing is the most noticeable thing in fact pretty sure that the writers let him improvise lot of his lines sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability though for the most part stone works best as dramatic actress sylvester stallone teamed up with stone once again is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor not typecast action star after snub at the oscars last year stallone is proving himself as the serious or comedic as illustrated here actor that he is gene hackman is superb as the gruff talking general almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns anne bancroft has minimal role but she effective nonetheless danny glover has small role but he does very very good job dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick euro trash bees both are very unrecognizable especially aykroyd jennifer lopez plays worker ant who falls in love with weaver although most people won recognize her voice either many people will recognize grant shaud voice as the foreman he played miles on the tv show murphy brown this is definitely huge cast with some high profile names and it will definitely help it grosses of course you can probably tell where lot of the $60 million budget went to also directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers though guterman did direct 1994 feature headless but both show an incredible talent for this type of picture tense at times and very funny throughout the two hold this film together like professionals the screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot but it contains lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults kids will delight in the animation while parents can laugh heartily at the humor most of it will go over young children heads does that mean you shouldn take kids to see it not at all they will have lot of fun watching this one what is great is the themes that are given to us part social commentary part romance story and part moral drama antz gives everyone something to talk about whether it be the animation or the discussions of individualism and community thankfully it not subtle in either aspects antz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action sometimes the language can be pushing the limits for family movie but the violence is what should keep kids at home the battle scene has ants melting in acid and bugs being speared to death and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight but other than that and some sexual innuendos it perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough but it still advisable to leave really young children at home have confused you enough if you do take your kids recommend seeing the film with them because more than likely you ll enjoy it the most
that the question asked myself when venturing nervously into the wedding singer the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus does he draw laughs from his sad puppy dog expression and don hate me for being simpleton observations or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over well there little bit of all of that in the wedding singer and while exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr sandler thing did have surprisingly good time that because in nutshell the wedding singer is one of the sweetest movies you re ever likely to come across that right sweet the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh out loud hysterical but the tone well it just lovely have to admit was half expecting farting armpit humor gratuitous nudity superfluous cloying subplots and some nasty unnecessary violence instead well ve said it before sweet the year is 1985 and sandler plays robbie hart the eponymous wedding singer job aspiring rock stars often settle for when robbie fianc dumps him at his own altar robbie gets depressed and turns to plucky waitress called julia drew barrymore who has some problems of her own she marrying hunky junk bonds dealer who unbeknownst to her isn that big on monogamy it isn giving anything away to say that robbie and julia fall in love aww sandler and barrymore are good match and they re assisted by some terrific cameo appearances including steve buscemi and jon lovitz whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film writer tim herlihy with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion it doesn all work but it handled with such light heartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans herlihy and director frank coraci have done great job of recreating the sights sounds and affectations of the 1980s the soundtrack an ever present force in the film is packed with wall to wall hits of the period new wave upon new wave of songs from billy idol beyaz wedding to the smiths how soon is now to culture club do you really want to hurt me the mix of music and fashion would make the wedding singer great double feature with boogie nights if you grew up listening to the cure and flock of seagulls and the psychedelic furs then the wedding singer is bound to put nostalgic hop in your stride if you re fan of the lovable laughable adam sandler well let just say that the wedding singer might well be the only film in recent memory to make me want to rent happy gilmore
the happy bastard quick movie review analyze this how does one do comedy focused on the mob well few years ago there was sly little comedy called the freshman which had marlon brando doing romp of send up of his famous don corleone character and recently the utterly stupid in bad way movie mafia failed to really get the joke this time around however warner bros may have gotten it right with analyze this movie that hits its targets more than it misses and for plenty of reasons the story goes like this mobster robert deniro finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and near death following drive by shooting it these attacks that prompt him to hire psychiatrist billy crystal who mostly reluctant to take the mobster case for two reasons first of course he mobster but secondly he trying to get married and enjoy quiet honeymoon with his wife lisa kudrow and kid and of course he can rest worth for moment because the mobster goons are always needing the shrink for something be it quick consultation or dream analyzation fortunately the movie is played out for plenty of laughs director harold ramis who also helmed the comedy multiplicity which wasn half bad keeps the tone peppy and light even if it sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments shootings can always be taken for laughs you know deniro does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy giving off somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas but with bit of lighter heart scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious crystal plays an excellent straight man to deniro character uplifting him from such bombs as father day and my giant kudrow is also hoot as crystal wife to be who on the verge of breakdown thanks to deniro presence is the movie perfect not really thanks to simplistic ending and some slightly wasted moments with character portrayed by chazz palminteri he comic actor too come on give him some more but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different but same for change taking his dramatic act to new field of comedy kudos to crystal and kudrow for not just making it his show either line of the movie crystal when you said you needed family therapy this is not the family had in mind
while watching boiler room was constantly reminded of last year masterpiece fight club both films consist of predominately male cast both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped while boiler room writer director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club he does contribute another impressive work to series of films aiming to represent the new generation generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be millionaire paying homage to oliver stone 1987 classic wall street younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older more experienced types as is true in real life younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages another similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks some people are convinced that an all male cast automatically means there must be gory violence here is proof that this is not true if you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck go see reindeer games this weekend if you want to see smart insightful film with excellent acting and clever script see boiler room giovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film narrator seth after dropping out of college and running lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment seth is offered high paying job by wealthy man nicky katt he agrees to take the job in which you are guaranteed to become millionaire within three years of selling stock to well off americans from the mid west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co workers learning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of good in production seth figures this is too good to be true after stumbling into room at the wrong time he knows there is something no good about this company at this point seth is left with the ultimate choice continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on ribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin playing seth dad the two have perfect chemistry as troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves the transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film the supporting cast of greedy co workers is also flawless ben affleck shines in short but sweet performance as recruiter for the company nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt the energy of the cast as whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring the only major error in the film is that nothing major happens there is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable due to the lack of major event boiler room never finds suitable genre to fit into the movie is not intense enough to be thriller the romantic segments involving seth and abby nia long are not properly finalized and the dialogue isn funny enough to make it comedy in having trouble to characterize the movie as whole boiler room is slightly confused at times it doesn seem to know which category to fit itself into one satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better otherwise the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors
trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick fish called wanda the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter the film opens with narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60 then cut to the harsh reality of the present sheffield has become some sort of semi slum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel factories once flourishing industry gaz carlyle spends most of his time in the worker club sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers he and his `plump friend dave addy as well as their former foreman gerald wilkinson have been sitting around the club for months without any `call for duty what seemingly was just passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he cannot afford the 700 pounds of child support money to his ex wife suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild idea to get the money he desperately requires dave and gerald too have problems of their own on top of his lack of employment dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as his`plump appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as months leaving home for `work when he was actually long standing member of the worker club there we have it people with real problems and not so practical solution for them gaz manages to get the support from them and sure enough they managed to get few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag to perform strip act at the local pub in gaz own words while looking at an add for strip act featuring hunky `beautiful men `if women are willing to pay for this they sure as well will pay for real men the full monty is very simple in nature and not trace ambitious at all it is small film which delves in the harsh reality of unemployment and the desperation it drives people to it also is very light movie to watch despite the theme it delves in because it has lot of human factor going for it never for once was it trying to be manipulative at all the full monty was true to itself all the way while the hilarity level of this film soared unexpectedly high audience will find that they are in no way being cheated of laugh something lacking in many comedy films wannabes from hollywood other than carlyle who acted as the psychotic begbie in trainspotting the rest of the actors were definitely very new to me on screen however the acting presented in this film is more than satisfying carlyle work here is stark contrast to his character in trainspotting implying real acting skill and flexibility on screen kudos to the people involved in this film especially to director peter cattaneo for being able to put together an excellent film which is has so much potential in ending up as your just another striptease already critical and financial success for such small film the full monty is humble film which deserves applause throughout while titanic managed to feast the eyes and soul in an epic way the full monty gives one the same satisfaction in half the time
you ll go ape over tarzan because it more fun than barrel of monkeys okay there the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie disney latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as small family attempts to escape from sinking ship father mother and infant somehow make it to shore amidst rousing song by phil collins and have soon built treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson it amazing the kinds of things you can do when you work to soundtrack before you know it an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala glenn close mother ape who recently lost her own baby to predatory leopard against the wishes of her mate and family leader kerchak lance henricksen she takes on the infant boy as her own tarzan is not so much story about human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild much of tarzan young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his father which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well meant his attempts all he looking for is acceptance perhaps goal easily identifiable by young viewers but one which will ring true with lot of adults when you really think about it this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end look back on past disney animated features and you ll see the trend growing up tarzan voiced by alex linz as child and by tony goldwyn as an adult has couple of friends one is an ape named terk rosie donnell and the other is paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor wayne knight both provide the requisite comic relief timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films just fill in the blanks can you see it now we have to have couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it we ve already had fish and crab and we ve had candle and teapot genie and dog few stone statues have we had an ape and an elephant yet well there we go of course there gotta be romance somewhere along the line so jane minnie driver gets introduced about halfway through together with her father dr porter nigel hawthorne and the big game hunter clayton brian blessed jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory you tarzan me jane scene thankfully those aren the exact words however found it distracting that tarzan is going ohh ohh ee ee one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction how does he tell his name to another ape ohh ohh ee tarzan ee ee ohh well regardless of my picky nature the romance actually works as only disney romance can purely contrived but for some reason rather believable but hey tarzan young adult do you think he dated few of the female apes before meeting jane isn that illegal in most countries oh well don think disney will be using my quote anymore tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not musical there lots of music to be sure but not single character song in the whole hour and half of running time we instead get more of phil collins concert as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material this isn really bad thing as the songs are very high energy and catchy found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day it just different do yourself favor and see this film in theater with good sound system because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie with each new feature disney animation gets even better not necessarily by leaps and bounds but since they put out new film each year steady rate of improvement is apparent and this definitely shows in tarzan there are couple of scenes where the animation achieves near effect and number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers and had me thinking this isn just tarzan it extreme tarzan however tarzan does not seem to have what call its chandelier scene which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort utilizing computer assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking lasting but few seconds at most it been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail as usual the voice talent is up to snuff convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters the one poor choice in casting however was rosie donnell going into the film didn know she was even part of it but when terk started talking recognized her voice immediately her performance was fine but through the rest of the film kept thinking that no boy ape that rosie donnell distracting to say the least ll admit ve never read the edgar rice burroughs story tarzan of the apes so couldn tell you how true this film stays to the book but unless you re purist you should have few objections to this film with solid

all great things come to an end and the dot com era embodies that perfectly beneath mound of bankruptcy paperwork lies the remains of former dot com darling the company kozmo com an online convenience store stocked with ice cream porn videos and other basic necessities of urban dweller all hand delivered by couriers within an hour designed in 1997 by two college roommates joseph parks 27 year old goldman sachs banker and yong kang kozmo flamed out in three short years raising more than $280 million in venture capital funding and from partnerships with such bigwigs as starbucks and amazon com by december 1999 the company boasted 000 employees in 11 cities its barking ceo park attracting all kinds of media attention the company was set for an ipo in may 2000 until april 14 2000 the day the stock market took its first big dive ending the internet era by april 13 2001 kozmo was out of money and ceased operations unlike the earlier similar documentary startup com which chronicled the rise and fall of another dot com govworks dreams focuses both on its original founders especially park and on the common folks that ran the day to day operations the contrast is amazing showing how cult persona can convince anyone that any idea is the next big thing the film director wonsuk chin too tired to die expertly juxtaposes upper management company meetings with on the spot interviews with the bike messengers general managers and floor staff that kept kozmo humming the film images give backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise the most satisfying part of the film comes in understanding to degree the expectations of numerous ceos commanding these titanic type businesses in the film final interviews with park we learn what happens when the money dries up and backers don return phone calls in the end the name of the game was profit and if you couldn make money even the dreamers got the axe screened at the 24th annual mill valley film festival
the jekyll and hyde story told from his maid point of view is in word dark you wouldn expect something bright and cheery based on robert louis stevenson novel but the film is surprisingly dreary and dismal jekyll hyde john malkovich is terminally depressed and desperate mary reilly julia roberts is victim of monstrous child abuse and the anti woman sentiment of the times director stephen fears version of the london slums makes us marvel that anyone survived them the lighting level is exceedingly low throughout the movie it almost appears to be filmed in siyah and beyaz the direction and cinematography are brilliant and liquid scenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off strawberry except there no kirmizi of course the look is so moody and melodramatic that you ll be shocked when you leave the theater saw it at matinee and took quite while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward often the jekyll and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting whole person into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts here the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good but certainly powerless his alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience two parts that make up whole neither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated disaster is inevitable the differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor and attitude when we finally see the transformation the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science fiction not the psychological horror that the tale demands roberts and malkovich are skillful in their roles both are suitably melancholy fitting in with the rest of the film the only flash of life and color comes from glenn close and her lips as the madam of whorehouse where hyde lives and surprisingly jekyll apparently frequents life and color maybe but this is not close best role she seems little more than cardboard cutout character beautiful film in its own dreary way you ll appreciate the filmmaking craft but don expect to leave in an upbeat mood
do you want to know the truth about cats and dogs do you well as this movie shows us they make good companions but pale in comparison to the joy and fulfillment romantic relationships can bring unfortunately there giant roadblock set up in our culture that only certain people can get through while the rest of us mill around outside feeling sorry for ourselves checkpoint beautiful kind of thing and janeane garafolo character abby relates to it well like certain oversized teenage movie critic she is intelligent and has great sense of humor but strikes out with the opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive and the men seem to be backing her up on that meanwhile her gorgeous neighbor nora uma thurman uma being the only woman name worse than nora attracts men like flies as abby tells her you burp and they think it cute you barf and they line up to hold your hair back but nora down on herself for being too shallow and superficial we all have our prwhen man calls in to veterinarian abby talk radio show wanting to know how to get the roller skates off his basset hound oh come on any idiot knows how to handle that problem he likes her personality and professional demeanor and asks to meet her in person abby though knows her body doesn match her personality and that she probably won have chance with him once he sees her so she gives him nora body description and stands him up nora happens to be in the studio the next day when the dog man comes by and abby asks her for big favor she goes along with the masquerade and the three of them head out for night of fun abby assuming the role of goat cheese farmer named donna the dog man finds out even though this girl is beautiful she not quite as intellectual or confident about herself in person but he doesn suspect anything realizing he not living in three company episode the charade continues with abby furthering the relationship over the phone including decidedly unnecessary phone sex masturbation sequence and nora furthering it in person while eventually finding herself attracted to the dog man like sleepless in seattle this comedy romance is predictable all the way through but we care enough about the characters that we root them on and will the romance to blossom the truth about cats and dogs isn quite as entertaining as was expecting it to be but it handles well theme could identify with the thing is find janeane garafolo rather attractive she no uma but sure in real life she have no problems attracting men on the other hand couldn attract man to save my life and am rather proud of that fact
contrary to the title the boxer is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics it actually three movies in one political film boxing film and love story all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal we ve seen it all before and we re just not blown away with it like we should be oh well it still an excellent irish story the boxer of the title is danny flynn jim sheridan staple daniel day lewis an ex ira member who gets out of belfast prison after 14 years and finds out that his troubles are far from over first off the ira is having small civil war between its leader joe hamill brian cox and one of its sub leaders harry gerard mcsorley both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail while this is going on danny and his old drunkard buddie ike ken stott who played the chief inspector in danny boyle shallow grave re open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects protestant and catholics to work together danny not only begins teaching kids how to box but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison and is ready to start boxing real people again and danny runs into his ex love maggie breaking the waves emily watson who hasn seen him since he went in they don easily start up their romance again because she the wife of prisoner whom she married during danny tenure in prison and also has son liam ciaran fitzgerald from him whom liam is hoping will get out soon but the two are slowly re drawn to eachother again and this begins to complicate things the political story is nothing really special but works in itself we ve seen it many time before but it at least interesting sometimes emotional and even riveting at times there big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty the boxing story is very minor to the story but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly and even with good sportsmanship there are only few boxing scenes but they re never like raging bull let strip down the sport to its bones brilliant they re more realistic and instead of bone crunching we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother which is slightly unerving at times and didn know daniel day lewis was in such good shape but the backbone of the story is the love one because these characters are given such horrible circumstances and since the two leads have such great chemistry together we really feel for their plight as the film goes on and circumstances get worse and worse the characters have to make real human decisions and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters this is how you write love story take note hollywood these elements are pretty much equally balanced with each of the parts of the stories working hand in hand with eachother loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered and sometimes spilled over into the next it made sure that we didn just care for one of them not saying they re all equally great because the love story really carries the film but at least they all work out respectively the acting is amazing with day lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry not sure if they re oscar nominee bound but they re very good in the supporting roles billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers but the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike who is just great scene stealer the direction and co writing by jim sheridan with the other co writing credit going to terry george is excellent rounding out the characters well but not pacing everything greatly noticed that the first half was very leisurely yet fascinating but the second half whirls by at quick pace and ends much too quickly more time could have been spent thinking up the ending since it does seem quite sloppy though the boxer is good film it never achieves the greatness that it should sure it masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get but on it own it just could have been better but it still works out gives us great love story combined with political and boxing drama and features great acting even if it could have been better this ll do
set in the wild west this carry on centres around the arrival of the rumpo kid sidney james and his cronies in stodge city his dodgy dealings and summary shootings aggravate judge burke kenneth williams so much that he asks sheriff albert earp jon pertwee to drive rumpo out of town instead the rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead therefore judge burke sends for law marshall to come in and clean up the city due to misunderstanding an english sanitary engineer called marshall knutt jim dale is assigned without knowing it as the law marshall for stodge city he arrives at the same time as annie oakley angela douglas who is seeking revenge for her father the sheriff murder when marshall arrives at stodge city he soon becomes aware of the misunderstanding and due to his rather limited intellect he is manipulated by the rumpo kid and always ends up getting things wrong in the end there is head to head between rumpo and marshall with the rumpo past experience it would seem that marshall is out of his depth but using his sanitary skills and learning the ways of the west from annie oakley he at least stands some chance sid james with an american accent is perfect as the rumpo kid part which suits him down to the ground jim dale provides one of his best carry on performances as the stupid sanitary engineer and angela douglas is very effective in her role as the revengeful daughter other regulars that appear in this movie include charles hawtrey and bernard bresslaw in his debut as big heap and little heap respectively big heap is the local indian leader and the crazy casting of hawtrey for this part is very amusing as is his performance he steals every scene he is in even though he does not enter the film until thirty minutes past joan sims provides useful and amusing support as belle the local bar owner who takes fancy to the rumpo kid however the part of doc played by peter butterworth and sheriff albert earp played by jon pertwee are not really necessary and pertwee performance is rather poor kenneth williams uses new voice but struggles with the weak part of the judge even so this carry on was sid james and kenneth williams favourite very different carry on film in that it is played more seriously by the actors and possesses more realism than any other carry on the death count is the highest of any carry on film sets costumes and action sequences are all very commendable the songs that are included in the movie the title song and annie song are very impressive strange but therefore very interesting carry on film not the best of its kind but it is certainly the most distinctive film of the series
118 minutes not rated though suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language mamoru oshii is name that probably isn very well known to most american audiences but perhaps it should be oshii was the director of last year best known japanese animated film import _ghost in the shell_ and is known among fans of japanese animation or anime for making films with deep philosophical bent one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series in its many incarnations graphic novels manga two different runs of made for video episodes original animation videos or oavs for short and television series running to nearly fifty episodes patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan set in the very near future though it was somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived this atypical giant robot anime features the characters rather than the machinery as the primary focus as whole patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains giant industrial robots known as labors an interesting play on words considering that robot is derived from the czech word for labor have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century with the rise of labors however has come new menace labor crime this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions using patrol labors to fight labor crime the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division sv2 who through no fault of their own have acquired bad reputation for destructiveness sometimes utterly hilarious sometimes almost deadly serious the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers the story as has much of patlabor before centers around the controversial babylon project gigantic seawall that will on its completion allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists most notably the house of sea organization however the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist but from someone who is already dead shinohara heavy industries the premier labor manufacturer in japan if not the whole world has just come out with new operating system that increases labors movement speed and efficiency by 30% this hyper operating system hos for short has very quickly been installed into well over 90% of the nation labors including the patrol labors of sv2 since that installation dozens of labors including heavily armed military model have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos some wags have compared this to windows 95 it up to asuma shinohara labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries to find the source of these problems before more labors including sv2 own fall victim to them and before hos drags his father company down with it as was the case with _ghost in the shell_ if you just want no brainer actionfest this might not be the movie for you _patlabor the movie_ is more of psychological thriller technological suspense drama it is closer perhaps to chrichton novel than to an action movie crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding there are long thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_ this movie is fraught with symbolism in fact large part of it is based on christian symbolism patlabor near future setting is aside from the giant robots tromping around very similar to our own present day the film uses this setting to make its central point is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new this is question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor alternate 1999 setting as far as the technical aspects of the film go referring to the subtitled version as that the only one ve seen the film transfer is clear almost phenomenally so the animation quality is incredible though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to the oavs and tv series were more cheerful better suited to humor the movie however makes everyone look great deal less cute and emphasizes that this is going to be for the most part deadly serious storyline as far as cinematography goes there are many interesting moments in _patlabor the movie_ don think can recall ever seeing fish eye perspective used in any other animated film save for _ghost in the shell_ another oshii film or indeed in many other movies at all the cinematography is well suited to the storyline emphasizing what it needs to though couple of scenes where characters features are exaggerated in anger may seem slightly strange to western audiences the audio track of _patlabor the movie_ is in glorious hi fi stereo and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems it _is_ that good even without headphones sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _come_ from that side giant robot footsteps are deep and booming the sometimes understated sometimes blaring score is crisp and clear and always right on the mark enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery as far as the subtitles go have to say that they re among the most easily readable subtitles ve ever seen for _anything_ large enough that they don strain the eyes but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen although it does have several action sequences in it most notably the climactic conclusion _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie although it is superbly realized film it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story and that could detract from some people enjoyment my
garry shandling makes his long overdue starring film debut as an alien from planet populated only by genetically created men who are looking to take over the earth by propagating their own species there shandling is chosen for the mission is given the name harold anderson and is set up as banker in seattle after few disastrous mating attempts he figures his best bet will be susan annette bening former alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she won have sex again until she gets married the leader of harold planet ben kingsley tells him to marry her and harold is soon exposed to all the joys of married life despite its title and premise which seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle from the late 1960s what planet are you from is very funny movie the plot which the film wisely doesn linger on the specifics of for too long is of course nothing more than framework for the jokes most of which work very well the material may be considered crude and tasteless by many and might have thought so as well had shandling not been the lead but he brings sort of pathetic charm to the role and it his performance that makes the film truly funny instead of just offensive plus if you think about it what planet are you from could have very easily gone the gross out route considering that shandling character is given detachable penis that vibrates and hums when he gets excited we never see anything though it all implied which gives the film touch of class amidst its crudeness glad to see that someone in hollywood still understands the concept of less is more the talented supporting cast certainly adds to one enjoyment of this film annette bening oddly playing merged version of her real estate salesman character from american beauty and her ditzy spiritualist character from mars attacks does fine job keeping up with shandling and makes good catalyst for his brand of humor she even manages to pull off potentially disastrous scene where she has to perform rather goofy rendition of high hopes for lengthy period of time ben kingsley john goodman and greg kinnear all fare well in their performances as well and linda fiorentino good lord there should be some sort of law stating that no woman can be that sexy everything about her character in this film oozes raw sexuality what planet are you from is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video the disc gives you the choice of either watching the film full frame or in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 85 and enhanced for 16x9 televisions also included on the disc as extras decent making of featurette an isolated score track talent files for the cast and crew and the film original theatrical trailer as well as trailers for wolf men in siyah bugsy and as good as it gets when first saw that the disc featured an isolated score track actually laughed how great could the music for silly little comedy be for it to get it own isolated track well as it turns out it mighty fine score from carter burwell fargo the hudsucker proxy that enjoyed listening to again while typed up this review kudos to columbia tristar for adding that feature to the disc what planet are your from was unjustly ignored in theaters and hope it finds its deserved audience on home video this fine dvd is certainly great way to see it [r]
there moment in schindler list when number of jews are trudging through snow clean and crisp dark edges and frost on the ground one girl waltzes through wearing kirmizi dress that stings the eyes it is probably the finest moment through out the film when first saw it began to cry though could not say why this landscape is the setting of many small moments that add up to one big whole when one man is shot in the head we see blood oozing out onto the ground so siyah and murky its almost pomegranate kirmizi at another time we follow young boy as he runs searching for hiding spot before finally squeezing into toilet which is already occupied like so citizen kane fargo the godfather the godfather part ii greed many of the greatest american films schindler list plays with the concepts of money power and soul but this is movie about man who does the right thing starkly emotional and brutally powerful schindler list strips away everything on the outset and leaves us ony feelings the following that it has gained is not suprising this is probably thus far the best film of the decade steven spielberg has always been skilfull filmmaker his assured hand churned out both jurassic parks jaws the indiana jones films and but it wasn until 1993 that we saw what brilliant man he can be the product of his genuis is really something to see it can bring tears to your eyes just as it uplifts you throughout we sense the deep control which he so masterfully spreads we watch oskar schindler liam neeson grow from an arrogant self important man who hires jews only to save money into moving figure with deep sense of pride and accomplishment the film requires much work and can be harrowing experience go expecting quick entertainment and you ll be bitterly dissapointed it does reward the patient viewer this is mature spielberg and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece this eqsuisite beautiful film is rare gem it does good job of summarizing why love movies it leaves one breathless uplifted and with much to think about afterwards you can reflect on individual images visions and people laconic removed schindler strides through the film detached prescence who watches all does much and leaves feeling as if he could should have done more then he did and was able to the change seems natural in the hands of lesser filmmaker it would be crude and would cheat the audience instead we are told tale told story the film is punishing to watch yes but anyone who allows themselves to get involved will experience miracle and genuine masterpiece of movie
ok admit had bad attitude about this film from the start romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents with couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure yuck but it not really too bad it has lot working against it for me at least in addition to the above it is typical of lot of recent movies in that it is really just glorified made for tv movie but longer and with bigger stars and you have to pay to see it it does win you over though even if it is painfully predictable just think about it two single parents with their cute kids are thrown together due to missed field trip through day of near disasters they cont inually meet get in one another way cause trouble for one another and generally insult one another at every opportunity in fact they hate each other so much that we know that they are or soon will be in love the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples so this film is predictable just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable and the screwball genre is obviously hoffman model for this film will they get fired from their yuppie jobs will they make the big soccer game that is so important to their kids will pfeiffer realize what jerk her ex husband drummer for bruce springsteen really is aren they all will they finally kiss well what do you expect but there is certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled especially when it is done with as much humour along with lack of sticky sentimentality as it is in this film pfeiffer and clooney have certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show one word of caution though this film is being billed in some places as family movie don let that stop you however think most kids especially boys would be pretty bored by this move after all nobody gets killed and there are no explosions all in all good non offensive date movie the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice

an astonishingly difficult movie to watch the last temptation of christ may be scorsese most important film and yet his most impossibly abstract as well scorsese presents the life of jesus christ through nikos kazantzakis novel which details the life of christ from approximately 20 until the day of crucifixtion jesus of nazareth dafoe is carpenter who opens the film making crosses so that he can escape the fate he is subjected to his destiny on earth yet he soon learns his evil ways for aiding in the deaths of others and subjects himself to desert in exile in hopes that he can reach god before leaving he asks for forgiveness from mary magdelene barbara hershey prostitute who is also childhood friend of jesus =20 after going to the desert christ learns his true purpose in life and what he must do aided by judas keitel he sets off on teaching the world his message along the way he meets john the baptist the rest of the prophets and tries to teach the world his message christ is also confronted by internal demons and self doubt as he tries to find his true purpose throughout the entire film during the story judas is the closese ally of jesus his betrayal argues the film was not out of hate but out of love in order to allow christ to die =20 he is eventually captured and crucified as per the bibile however as he is about to die on the cross he is saved by girl who brings him to his marriage with mary magdelene the girl is guardian angel who is from god and who has saved him from his death jesus goes on to live life as man as carpenter and does not die on the cross on his deathbed in the final moments of his life he is visited by the prophets and by judas who denounces his master for not keeping his end of the bargain judas reveals the angel to truly be the devil and the life jesus had lived to be the ultimate selfish act jesus escapes from his deathbed and asks his father for forgiveness for succumbing to his last temptation visually and aurally the film is absolutely breathtaking no other director has even come close to realizing jerusalem during the time of christ life to the screen peter gabriel contributes score than is simply astonishing with pulsing rhythms that capture the viewer the performances are simply exquisite with dafoe leading the way with mesmerizing turn as jesus keitel although his accent is problem is passionately brilliant fighting through language to bring the character to life the visuals are also amazing scorsese frames his movie in harsh tone leaving the impression that jesus truly is man who is having human frailties the film though has many trouble spots paul schrader script is one schrader uses modern day new york english to tell the story along with new york words new york mannerisms and new york slang speech the film also does not focus on the godly aspects of christ there is no underlying message behind the man words the film fails to capture the glory and splendor of christ had it faithfully explored that aspect than the dichotomy of jesus soul his frailties and doubt mixed with his unmistakable glory would have been simply spectacular the message of christ is confused between love and violence and the film merely tells us jesus is great instead of showing us his greatness the film is also overlong it just drags in the middle with nothing truly happening christ is confused figure in the sense that the audience doesn know who he really is schrader forgets to give jesus message to show that he truly is the messiah to give him the divinity without that he is rambling prophet who the audience themselves do not believe there are several moments of accidental hilarity and most of them occur when jesus is attempting to preach there are moments of brief awe and power followed by moments of confused hilarity that said the controversial temptation sequence is something to behold it is step in an unexpected direction one that leaves the audience puzzled until the arrival of the disciples it is simply breathtaking scene with jesus about to die as mortal it is truly one of scorsese finest moments it is unfortunate that scorsese couldn make film about christ as powerful as that one scene =20
it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system no major surprise when mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority small wonder that hollywood most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual underdog against some larger collective oppressive witness braveheart born on the fourth of july rocky first blood clear and present danger jfk the list goes on there little of that in singapore we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line though the government been long worried about the younger people getting americanised and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition the people vs larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america sex does pornography have right to exist and circulate larry flynt the publisher of hustler magazine thinks so and obviously so too the congress which last month threw out bill to curb pornography on the net but even with such actions americans remain undecided the oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire what they have ignored is actually great picture woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as to hell with morality to hell with the law and to hell with the system anti christ that we last saw in natural born killers and he is outrageous and convincing as nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex stripper wife dearly the latter is played with abandon conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination if not of the award itself edward norton plays their jerky lawyer the relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox superficially they are immoral outcasts who ve had it coming woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down and courtney dies of aids god damnation but in the powerful love they have for each other each standing by the other in turn the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still moralist and in the american context christian if they can love and care and feel just like anyone else on personal level friedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moral christian influences to go beyond good and evil this is great picture no doubt and love it personally because it is moving funny ends with open american optimism blah blah but like it and admire it because it comes from fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases there are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities this movie is not so much about larry flynt but about americans and american society
sci fi comedy starring jack nicholson pierce brosnan annette benning glenn close martin short and other stars warner bros picture the martians have landed in this hillarous tim burton movie before entering the cinema was initially little bit nervous about what this film would be like many people were saying that this film was silly rubbish and there was no point to it all how wrong they were left this film feeling much happier than was before entered the cinema the story is about martians attacking earth using ray guns hooray they generally cause havoc around the and other countries nicholson plays the president who must try to stop invasion and also taking advice from his loopy officials but basically its load of set pieces showing the martians destroying earth the way people are killed by the ray guns is great they is hillarous and mildly disturbing scene involving martian lady mad general who just wants to nuke the aliens away and ends up getting squashed by an aliens foot and gory finale involving lots of alien heads exploding but most of all this film is fun the martians are full of character the performances are spot on and the all star cast help make the film more enjoyable the film is million times better then the dire independance day and is real tribute to the tacky 50s invasion movies they are is great score by danny elfman and lots of laughs this has to be the best invasion ve seen for long time
if this keeps up jane austen sense and sensibility pride and prejudice may have to apply for posthumous membership to the screen writers guild yet another novel of hers has made the transition to the silver screen mansfield park is turn of the century 18th century going on 19th story about love among the classes as well as an examination into proper society and family ties ten year old fanny price hannah taylor gordon jakob the liar taken from her mother and father and the poverty in which they dwell is sent to live with her aunt and the privileged class at mansfield park under the stern patriarchal hand of her uncle sir thomas bertram harold pinter mojo spending her days reminded of her lower status she also invents and writes fanciful stories during her private times fanny eventually grows to become beautiful intelligent and engaging heroine quite unlike the original character which ms austen originally penned in her novel writer director patricia rozema when night is falling is responsible for the textual changes from purely dramatic perspective the revision makes perfect sense and improves the film audience appeal what ms rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of ms austen own personality by including excerpts from the author journals giving that dialogue to fanny the result is central character that is immediately appealing as the grown fanny australian actress frances connor all about adam does wonderfully textured work at times ms rozema has fanny address the camera directly to communicate many of the novel more introspective observations this is difficult device to work seamlessly into period film and it is to ms connor credit that it works as well as it does the central theme which gives the story its legs in an old one whether it is better to marry for love or for social standing fanny has fallen in love with her cousin edmund jonny lee miller plunkett macleane who appears fond of her as well his attentions are soon divided as the stylish and socially acceptable mary crawford embeth davidtz bicentennial man enters the picture along with her equally acceptable brother henry alessandro nivola inventing the abbotts who eventually sets his romantic sights upon fanny while mary and henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections their presence does provide the movie and the main characters with the necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the film appropriately austen like ending other thematic devices include awkwardly inserted reference to the source of the wealth of mansfield park the slave trade there is also hint of both lesbianism and incest but neither is carried very far and is soon forgotten the motivation for marriage remains the primary thematic thrust fanny cousin maria bertram victoria hamilton persuasion is an example of one making poor match marrying well to do fool who is able to make her comfortable but never happy fanny own mother trapped in her chosen life of squalor warns fanny by admitting that her situation is due to the fact that she married for love fanny given those two terrible examples and faced with the same choice is understandably indecisive as to which way to lean the spiritual answer of course lies in the middle of those two extremes marriage is not cold calculating decision based upon self preservation neither is it senseless decision made in the warm afterglow of passionate embrace in the purest sense marriage forms an insoluble union whereby two people agree to function as one and said for this cause shall man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh matthew 19 [kjv] love and logic can be combined god word contains both so does marriage based upon his truth
want to correct what wrote in former retrospective of david lean war picture still think that it doesn deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute list of the 100 greatest american movies and think that lumet 12 angry men wilder witness for the prosecution and kubrick paths of glory would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958 but can deny the importance of the bridge on the river kwai cinematically and in its contents the film is set in burma in 1943 bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai but the british commanding officer colonel nicholson alec guinness insists corresponding to the geneva conventions that his officers needn work as simple workmen struggling toughly col nicholson forces the japanese commandant col saito sessue hayakawa to give way in this respect afterwards col nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge he considers it an opportunity to raise his men morale and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese but the british high command sends few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge among them the american shears william holden an escapee from the japanese prison camp and the british major warden jack hawkins flaw of the picture is the clich characterization of the japanese people they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british as if the japanese were incapable of building bridge and the film doesn consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in paths of glory lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies this is also perceptible in the conversations between col nicholson and col saito in this regard it is symptomatic that shears who doubts the military logic is somehow unpleasant person in the film the audience is supposed to applaud col nicholson perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col nicholson takes for his men the plot by passes these risks that means the picture isn perfect but it has lot of virtues as well it shows the madness of war and what war can produce in people minds it shows how col nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being hero and that others like shears get cynics and the bridge on the river kwai is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti war film despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme david lean effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates high suspense especially in the dramatic though not wholly plausible showdown alec guinness does magnificent job of bringing col nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character the other actors deliver very good performances as well jack hildyard fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses karl rackwitz klein ris germany 1999
when first heard that romeo juliet had been updated shuddered thought that yet another of shakespeare classics had been destroyed fortunately was wrong baz luhrman has directed an in your face and visually stunning piece with this film it revolves around the two rival families who in this version each run multi million dollar enterprises these rival companies families are the capulet and the montague the younger generation of these two families have formed gangs who despise one another as the storylines goes romeo montague played by leonardo dicaprio and juliet capulet claire danes meet at fancy dress party and it is love at first site never believed love at first site was possible until saw this film the scene in which romeo eyes meet juliet through the fish tank is one of the most memorable of course they cannot publicly reveal their love for their families are arch enemies so they marry in secret this is where things begin to go wrong the story as with all good shakespeare ends in tragedy the cinematography is spectacular to say the least and the soundtrack provides the perfect atmosphere in which to lay our scene as the film says there is very little to criticise the performances are convincing and several of the film younger stars may find that it provides launch for their careers the modernisation of the script is ingenious and clever despite the well known storyline this latest version still manages to cause tears among many members of the audience especially the younger generation and this is certainly great credit to the film
when was growing up in 1970s boys in my school used to divide into two groups based on their action movies preferences the first one myself included liked movies that featured spectacular car chases lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks probably because they could or to be more precise thought they could imitate its stunts in the real life decades later while refining my own cinematic taste began to appreciate and actually like those movies probably because of overexposure to shoot em up idiocy of 1980s ramboids yes most of the kung fu and other martial arts flicks were cheap they had predictable and formulaic plot and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills but in the same time those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation the best of those movies one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon made in 1973 in joint hong kong hollywood venture it was intended to bring bruce lee skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience it succeeded but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor lee plays quiet shaolin monk who is martial arts expert he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri annual martial arts tournament that is held on remote island owned and controlled by han renegade shaolin monk interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics gun running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons harra han brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee sister years ago the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us williams played by jim kelly is siyah activist running from the racist police and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later the main hero was faced against power hungry megalomaniac on remote island alone against whole army of bad guys on the other hand lee was more believable hero than bond deprived of guns and super tech gadgets he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive in the same time the plot although extremely thin allowed him even some internal battles between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti violent philosophy the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence although two other main actors john saxon being the obligatory good beyaz guy and jim kelly being the obligatory siyah good guy were intended to share top spot with lee they served as nothing more than comic relief it is real shame to see kelly definitely the worse actor than saxon to steal the scenes from him only because his lines being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches sound so damn over the top other actors not including shih kien who turns han into typical although not very convincing bondian villain are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee among them is young jackie chan fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre in many way they are also more realistic they were personally staged by lee himself demanding only blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent not martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today simply can avoid to appreciate the difference from today movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end so despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times enter the dragon is incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don like that particular genre
even if did not know that director and co writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the files would have inevitably made connection the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon like plot to the mysterious characters to the overall dark ominous settings it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case they witness stuff like this on weekly basis in fact mulder and scully would have been much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie another more important similarity is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time this is great accomplishment for teen horror movie especially when compared to some of the trash of the same genre released in the last couple of years urban legend and still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch what helps final destination is its unique premise unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with knife chases blonde cheerleaders the villain presented is unusual it the grim reaper this being already has predestined when and how you will die according to the brief history lesson given in this film everyone was meant to die at certain time some people at 100 others at 17 whatever death chooses what is unique about death is that it already dead so you can really kill it the only way to defeat death is to cheat it the question is how do you do that this dilemma is what faces alex and group of teenagers alex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on trip to paris will crash leaving no survivors alex begins to realize that his dreams are little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off shortly after the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal however death isn through with them yet it gradually kills off the seven one by one leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again the plot allows for some of the most creative original death scenes have seen in while some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films sure it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ali larter character is particularly annoying but the shocks from the beginning to the end are extremely entertaining also director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously he knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that won win any academy awards not even golden globe the myriad of inside jokes and gags the characters are named after famous horror directors one character who plays jerk is named carter like files creator chris carter and song by john denver who died in plane crash plays whenever death is near show this movie is bunch of guys having good time making movie and from this had great time watching the movie
james jones one of the major novelists from the middle of the twentieth century has written number of fictional works about the effects of war on the individual veteran of world war ii and witness to the pearl harbor bombings his novels are not only grounded in realism but poetic in nature they are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence trait which lends itself to razor sharp focus but perhaps none matches the scope of his autobiographical novel the thin kirmizi line now cinematic masterpiece from director terrence malick the book principal cast some thirty characters has been trimmed down for this rendition but it still retains its most endearing value each of the roles has an everyman quality emphasizing jones examination of world war ii on the american soldier there definitive chain of command present and this also plays on the motivations of the cast but most importantly and perhaps intrinsic to the novel but not to the movie dynamic and effective voice over is used malick has several characters relating their thoughts giving the viewer greater perspective of the issues at stake the issues at stake are many and one told from limited third person perspective as opposed to top down omniscient view the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company for charlie to take hill during the conflict at guadalcanal the south pacific island is seen by the top brass as the key position for american armed forces to hold if they want to win the war and want to win the war they do in an excellent performance nick nolte plays for charlie commanding officer lt col gordon tall he an aging soldier who embodies the win at all costs mentality if only to impress his superior john travolta in questionable cameo this philosophy is opposite that of captain bugger staros elias koteas who dearly values the life of each and every one of the men under his command at the front are the privates and corporals adrien brody james caviezel ben chaplin et al lead by 1st sgt welsh sean penn who must actually execute the suicide orders handed down to them the thin kirmizi line is filled with intense visual poetry but it nearly three hours long although the interest level is high throughout the first two hours the climax comes forty five minutes before the end of the movie it goes without saying that the movie drags on the back end the thin kirmizi line will doubtless be compared to 1998 other masterpiece of war saving private ryan countless number of times but to do so is to belittle both films for although similarities abound so do differences director malick has story to tell and for those interested in listening this can be very outstanding movie
an energetic visually stunning but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne arc in history jeanne arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors who can basically alter the story as they wish she came in time where people desperately needed saint hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness director writer luc besson nikita leon portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend he tries not to show her as saint or villain he shows her as human being in time where blood was almost pouring from the sky and the air smelled of rotten flesh it is hard to keep your sanity the only support and hope is in god at the age of 13 jeanne milla jovovich watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers this terrible event makes lasting impact on jeanne mind god is no longer her support he has become her obsession she starts seeing visions and signs that command her to raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny with the help of the wise yolande aragon faye dunaway and charles vii john malcovich whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences only occasionally resorting to calmer tempo the movie is filled with dreamy symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship that create surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere the film is lost in time and space hysterically jumping back and forth in jeanne thoughts imagination and conscience besson visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle but the film is far from being flawless the script needs lot of polishing except for jeanne there are no real characters and although grand star cast is assembled their characters are nothing more than props not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing as for the maiden of lorraine herself she is portrayed as simple girl too small for her divine task in the latter part of the film we see her as hysterical confused and on the brink of madness with her past purity and innocence for ever lost jovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect but though her screen time is incredible excessive both malcovich being john malcovich and dunaway titus surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance and even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part besides casting jovovich besson only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting there are some viscously evil englishmen that murder pillage and betray with smile on their faces and some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen represented by the three musketeers of this story the brave gilles de rais vincent cassel the wise aulon desmond harrington and the strong la hire richard ridings though all those actor perform well their characters are nothing more than symbols banners that proclaim the glory of france and thus there is no sense of realism in this film the messenger has muscles instead of brains there is some relief in the end where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking dustin hoffman appearance helps and the film ends elegantly and surprisingly effective with climax worthy of praise jeanne character is unlocked but whether god was in the picture or not is never quite explained was she confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge or was she truly messenger of god the film poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious bess messenger is nothing more than fairly good film it is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater maybe the sound the dreamy sequences but certainly not the dialogue it is an elegant and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtv generation that although presents some interesting material works better when it on the battlefield
dangerous beauty is really nothing more than grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583 it is beautifully filmed wonderfully acted and certainly nothing short of entertaining but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness dealing with themes of forbidden love religious intolerance subordination of women sexual freedom and the roles of pleasure and sin in high cultured society it still feels like brightly lit fluff the director marshall herskovitz doesn want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down so he opts for more genial livelier and relatively shallow interpretation the film takes place during the renaissance time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe at this time venice was its own republic and it thrived on being the central juncture of east west commerce the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived however there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment the story centers on veronica franco catherine mccormack lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier rufus sewell the son of wealthy aristocratic parents jeroen krabb and joanna cassidy unfortunately the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love rather it was more like business transaction where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power wealth and ensure that outsiders couldn get in veronica despite her charm and good looks is certainly an outsider after short love affair marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her however because she is beautiful and intelligent veronica has chance to enter marco world albeit not as his wife she decides to become courtesan class of women who were as well educated as they were ravishing and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite courtesan was not mere prostitute they were afforded special place in society and they were greatly revered respected and often envied at one point character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother paola jacqueline bisset who was once famed courtesan herself once she enters the lifestyle veronica finds that it suits her quite well she is allowed to read all the books she wants she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet including the awestruck marco their relationship develops into playful bantering with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco advances in many ways their relationship is sad because marco is married to women he is unable to love and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love love the love not the man as her mother told her dangerous beauty which was based on factual book by margaret rosenthal flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice it has multiple plot lines including veronica adversarial relationship with court poet oliver platt her role in obtaining france military assistance in venice battle against the turks and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition yet it is never confusing or overbearing much of the film success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson ire in braveheart 1995 mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of leading lady she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in courtesan her character is intelligent witty and both sensual and vulnerable all of which mccormack easily transmits with single flash of her eyes the rest of the roles are also filled well including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in dark city have assured him solid place in hollywood he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas oliver platt plays variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like second skin although the film deals his character cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy platt is good actor but he just too hard to hate jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was and even fred ward turns up in small but moving performance as marco uncle dangerous beauty is marshall herskovitz sophomore directorial effort after the overlooked 1993 film jack the bear partnered with edward zwick herskovitz has spent most of his time as producer on television thirtysomething my so called life and in the movies legends of the fall his directing style can be best described as transparent it never gets in the way of the story yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions he could have approached the film in any number of ways including overdosing on the sexual aspect which he wisely avoids dangerous beauty contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic but not so much that it seems exploitative herskovitz is also aided by strong supporting crew including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli whose previous efforts include the highly stylized thriller kalifornia 1993 and abel ferrara dark sci fi film body snatchers 1994 bazelli captures the film in strong bold colors and be brings sixteenth century venice to life in wide panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery however the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood brazil the princess bride and the costumes by gabriella pescucci the age of innocence the only problem with dangerous beauty is that it doesn stick with you it good story well told with interesting characters but it easy to shrug off once you ve left the theater the only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions but it never quite comes off because it simply too melodramatic and conventional herskovitz tries with all his might to make it nailbiter but somehow its outcome is foregone conclusion and like the rest of the film it carries no real weight despite the potential severity of the subject matter
at first glance daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie on second glance it looks that way too although as typical disaster movies go daylight isn that bad admittedly it seems to rip off great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by think poseidon adventure but the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the haven seen this scene somewhere before feeling that creeps up all too often during the film sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york emergency response team by sheer luck he is in the right place at the right time when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film what disaster is that you ask as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat glad you asked through whole sequence of entirely probable events about as probable as hitting the lottery large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends which causes not only massive loss of life but traps dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel good old sly who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses offers his services to the rescuers who gladly accept it sly then enters the tunnel through vent shaft think judge dredd which he can only go in and not out off and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside so begins the fun but the fun has to be quick because this tunnel has started to spring leak the acting is about what you would expect of stallone movie not superb by any means but far above some of his other films think judge dredd again daylight acting is probably average or little above in terms of this sort of genre starring this particular star amy brenneman is the only actor of any note and she does pretty good job as stallone reluctant helper oh yeah stallone real life son sage is in this too sage nice name guess it could be worse he could have been named nutmeg or parsley note to sage you are still young go to school and get good education you don have future in acting the plot runs along the same lines as the acting interesting but predictable mostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from dozen other action flicks the biggest problem with film of this nature is that they try to cram too many things into the movie as soon as the cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle another one seems to pop right up even worse than the last one realize that it wouldn be much of movie otherwise but it does make the movie bit predictable adding to the predictability is the cast of characters which of course has to include at least one or two difficult people who want to do things their own way and think the qualified guy in this case stallone doesn know what he is doing why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with each other and all work together would this be too much to ask can we all just get along special effects weren bad but ve certainly seen better some of the scenes while fun to watch were such blatant rip offs that you had to wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim especially all of the scenes that involved anything underwater the tunnel of course starts to flood really expected gene hackman roddy mcdowell and ernest borgnine to appear at any minute wasn sure if was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure suppose if you have to rip off movie for good ideas the poseidon adventure is good one to use the underwater sequences aside from the deja vu were very well shot and worked fairly well they were the best part of the movie by long shot better than average stallone flick realize that not saying much when the man has judge dredd on his resume but certainly not up to the standards of cliffhanger daylight is fun movie and as long as you aren expecting whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised
after rather disappointing mary railly stephen frears is now officially back in business with comeback worthy of praise this is one of the best surprises of this season sweet small budget comedy with big heart in fact it not even comedy it drama or even more precise clever satire on human relationships and needs based on 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby ``high fidelity is wry and likable story about man quest for fulfillment and happiness rob gordon was dj it seems that he could make everything spin except his own life now he owns championship vinyl little musical store somewhere in new york when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend gorgeous blond attorney life suddenly looses every purpose decimated humiliated and on the verge of mental and emotional breakdown he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been about what right and what important he starts categorizing life dividing it into top lists and the most important is the top list over the most painful breakups of his life starting with 5th grade when he found his young girlfriend with another boy though you might think that people change grow more mature with age it just doesn seem that way and all rob relationships were different versions of that first where did he go wrong was it he that screwed up or maybe life just stinks while he is lost in his own self pity he must think of the top list over his needs for the future find the right elements and mix his life together with clever parallels to the cult of celebrity music and with incredibly direct narration it addresses the average audience member in other words people like you and me although lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and frears the director the acting is equally important as the written word and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned he is simply superb it is as much his movie as it is frears the film would not be the same without him cusack whose character is sadder wiser and 35 brings intelligence and warmth to post mod irony most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera not an easy task but cusack pulls it off his interpretation feels so emotionally right so incredibly realistic and precise that frears message simply can be ignored or overseen the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job both ______ and jack siyah are fabulous even catherine zeta jones appears in role where she actually acts not just looks beautiful however the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers spectacular comic performance as rob co worker and friend dick this is such an impressive achievement that it almost worth oscar nomination he is simply joy to behold otherwise everyone are in their place and at the right time all part of frears colorful blend pretty much like edward norton keeping the faith this film doesn follow any formula or belong to any genre it dramatic tragic sarcastic comic and even cynical but never bitter or angry it little bit of everything pretty much like life itself nothing seems unreal or staged it reflects reality as mirror as you watch it you go through the same emotional problems as the main character you feel and think and reflect this effect has become rarity nowadays although it primarily about the perils of love ``high fidelity is secondarily about pop music rob owns championship vinyl and his employees timid dick todd louiso and overbearing barry jack siyah are fellow music snobs music is the language in their lives the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives and so does the movie it is as much musical film as anything else as rob journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments in the end you have gained something while watching it it not the film of the century or even of the year it not an special effects extravaganza it doesn require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed it small movie about the big things and even though it does not contain heavy philosophy you feel as if you have experienced something of significance and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time
with many big budget science fiction films great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts cheesy plot twists and terrible acting the fifth element the abyss and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting writing or both at first glance the matrix larry andy wachowski sci fi kung fu shoot em up spectacular looks like prime candidate to join the list of high concept bad movies especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role but despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue the matrix works it an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films most obviously the terminator films star wars and total recall but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout reeves plays neo computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with trinity carrie anne moss rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks unseen omniscient cult figure known as morpheus lawrence fishburne and trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell neo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems moreover he discovers that the grim bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it neo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah with grave doubts that he is actually the one prophesized to come and save the world reluctant or not what follows is mix of hong kong style slow motion shootouts surreal dream sequences high speed chases and comic book kung fu fights the film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality how exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind and if the real world were much harsher and grim than fantasy one you were living in would you want to face the true world or continue to live in more comfortable illusion unfortunately the matrix doesn provide many answers to the questions it raises but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions shoot outs and flying roundhouse kicks perhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving who plays agent smith the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix weaving stony appearance deadpan voice and chilling comments put grim human face on the haunting evil technological force that controls the matrix like robert patrick as the shapeshifting 1000 terminator in terminator judgement day weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because despite his power and seeming invincibility he looks ordinary even scrawny weaving embodies his role with memorably chilling presence the film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography it seems to be deliberately kitchy with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors in few scenes the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is bit jarring however with the comic book style and tone of the film you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience the matrix isn classic its open ended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions it also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero the kind of shmaltzy feel good goo that most of the film avoids reportedly the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel unfortunately audiences deserve little more than vague sense that the story will continue in the future the matrix is an fun enjoyable diversion like big puff of cotton candy at carnival just don be surprised half an hour later when you still feel little hungry
whenever writer director robert altman works in specific genre he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms he made the west dirty in mccabe and mrs miller 1971 he parodied hard boiled detective stories in the long goodbye 1973 and he transformed cartoon into flesh and blood with popeye 1980 the same holds true for his most recent film the gingerbread man which reinvents genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years the john grisham movie by the time the gingerbread man was completed there was very little evidence that it was ever based on story by grisham there no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise matthew mcconaughey chris donnell or matt damon and it doesn feature great showdown in courtroom instead of being grand ode to the powers of the legal profession the gingerbread man is rain soaked southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters twisting plot line siyah humor somewhat bleak ending and even altman trademark full frontal female nudity the central character of the film is rick magruder who is unlike any of grisham other lawyer heroes he is older experienced and rich he drives cherry red $80 000 mercedes that never gets dirty even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah georgia where the story unfolds rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife leeanne famke janssen and he rarely gets to see his two children jeff jesse james and libby mae whitman reason is never given for the divorce but it isn hard to surmise that rick womanizing had large part in it whenever he late to pick up the kids on his visitation days leeanne always assumes it because he been screwing around after an office party celebrating another of his court victories he hasn lost in eight years rick becomes involved with mallory doss embeth davidtz one of the catering waitresses he drives her home because her car has been stolen and they end up in bed together rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father dixon doss robert duvall grungy stringy bare footed old man who leads commune of other greasy old codgers it was actually dixon who stole her car that night and when rick asks why mallory replies that he always does weird stuff like that as another character puts it dixon is few beers short of six pack rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell private investigator friend robert downey jr and testimony from mallory begrudging ex husband pete randle tom berenger dixon is put in mental hospital but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out from there the story delves into kidnapping murder double crossing and even hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action altman cinematographer changwei gu gives the film dark soaked look if it isn night time at least it raining gu shoots the interiors which are almost all dark wood paneling with minimum of light great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability in the city there is danger enough but when rick has to venture into the woods you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre from westerns to epic dramas to comedies but no matter what the genre he is always sure to give it the altman stamp which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings the gingerbread man is no different although his style is much more restrained here however without those little touches the film could have easily slumped into routine action thriller great deal of the credit for the film success can be given to the actors especially branagh who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction here the british actor consistently maintains serviceable southern drawl while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic rick is an extremely flawed man but branaugh brings real humanity to his character without it the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick pain and frustration the supporting actors also put in fine performances including embeth davidtz who is probably best known for her heart breaking role as the jewish maid in schindler list 1993 tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief and robert duvall spends most of his on screen time just looking weird it doesn seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue but watch him closely during the film one courtroom scene his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing while the gingerbread man isn in league with altman greatest works like nashville 1975 or the player 1992 it is nonetheless solid piece of genre filmmaking which may prove successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career some critics love to stamp films like this as commercial as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at tiny audience and don make money altman has done something much better he took what could have been generic movie and by investing artistry and effort he made it into something more
can already feel the hate letters pouring in on this one folks loved the wedding singer but it gets worse if so much as mention titanic in the same sentence hell same paragraph as the wedding singer bound to be lynched well lynch me then because thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory with titanic as the only exception right away you re ready to discount my review aren you you re thinking that can possibly know what talking about after all this is adam sandler right well there more actually got choked up and more than once yes the man who brought us billy madison and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes but before you shrug me off as an imbecile urge you to see the movie and see for yourself the wedding singer is the story of robby hart sandler 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so but when his own wedding results in no show for the bride angela featherstone as linda robby begins to re examine his life and wonder why true love doesn exist for people like him in the process of performing at these receptions robby meets waitress named julia played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore whose reputation is anything but this character julia too is engaged and when robby finds himself without wife his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding seeing as how her fiance the miami vice loving glenn matthew glave doesn seem all that interested as the time goes by we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding he merely marrying julia to prevent breakup something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women it obvious that robby is going to fall for julia and feel strong need to rescue her but what is lighthearted romantic comedy for this isn sleepless in seattle but actually compare it to that before compare it to happy gilmore while the wedding singer maintains some of that post snl cornball humor its sincerity and charm carry it very very long way sandler is great in his role and yes if you allow it you can take him seriously barrymore seems perfect along side him and although the two more likely represent gen moronism and party girl ditzism respectively the two go together like bread and butter as mid eighties couple one scene in particular where julia ponders the future in mirror is so well done was on the verge of tears unfortunately sandler is going to make lot of people shrug this one off as no brainer but it got so much surprise substance packed inside that encouraging everyone to go see it in fact the entire theater applauded when the film ended and laughs were so consistent some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar the 1985 setting was milked for everything it was worth and for those of us that are old enough to remember it it was bodacious trip back and done very well sandler shows new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm or is it anti charm while the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit grading it on pure enjoyability would give this one four stars it hilarious and it touching it got that great cheezy humor but it also takes sandler to higher level than anyone expected this is one to see again and again is it possible the wedding singer could be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of 1998 my magic ball predicts it is certain
kevin smith is like big kid his humor is that of sophisticated juvenile he grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books having also written few he also has cult following mostly composed of teenagers college students and smith own fellow adolescent minded grownups smith is hilarious in person and in writing but when he tries to be earnest and moralize that is when he goes wrong kevin smith is better writer than director and he ll be the first to tell you that that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy handed great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them this was true in the overrated chasing amy and it is true for dogma as well that is not to say smith message is bad one in dogma smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god desires is superior to anyone else basically dogmatism is bad changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight they also know what is best for you whether you like it or not this is not exactly new message in movies see inherit the wind but have no problems with recycling old ones particularly since dogma protesters are proving smith point smith own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading dogma for dummies book but this is smith personality and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible or koran etc correctly or if there even is correctly and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany linda fiorentino being chosen by voice of god metatron alan rickman to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels bartleby ben affleck and angel of death loki matt damon along the way forgotten thirteenth apostle rufus chris rock stripper muse serendipity salma hayek and slacker duo jay and silent bob jason mewes and kevin smith himself come to bethany aid fallen muse azrael jason lee proves to be the behind the scenes manipulator for all the chicanery the logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith points and in itself has little dramatic momentum among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is woman jesus was siyah and the bible was written by bunch of racist misogynistic beyaz men of course kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself they are metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie when harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes smith thought it might give validation to protesters claims that the film was sacrilegious but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into joke the film humor is uneven some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for fire extinguisher when metatron makes burning bush kind of entrance but many of the film jokes just bomb as in virtually anything involving salma hayek serendipity also some of the jokes can be seen coming from mile away still smith keeps the zingers coming at sufficiently rapid pace among the actors fiorentino and rickman stand out by far fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight damon and affleck are fairly lackluster rock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith but the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob who recur in all of smith movies are much more in line with smith brand of humor bud cort george carlin janeane garofalo guinevere turner and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances
synopsis captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend peaceful community of 600 the ba ku from the evil admiral dougherty and ru afro the enterprise crew in the meantime experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba ku homeworld lt worf grows pimple data sings opera pieces picard scores with ba ku chick riker shaves while sharing bubblebath with troi and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts comments star trek the next generation was hugely successful sequel tv series to star trek science fiction series which developed devoted fan following in the 1970s even though it still enjoyed high ratings star trek the next generation ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original star trek cast in paramount film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise star trek insurrection is the ninth star trek movie and the third to focus on the star trek the next generation crew star trek insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans such as myself would rate somewhere between okay and good after star trek the final frontier nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant star trek voyager tv series star trek fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise don wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies most people reading this probably haven followed star trek anyway so comparison would seem tedious at best let me thus make my comparisons briefly so that it out of my system star trek insurrection is not as good as the previous installment star trek first contact star trek insurrection comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv the voyage home star trek ii the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie okay let move to the movie itself star trek insurrection infuses basic science fiction premise humanity exploration and colonization of space with lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners this combination works well more often than it fails but when it does fail the humor really seems cheesy much of this film appeals to trek fans nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise crew audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times star trek insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba ku homeworld forget the actors and special effects the beautiful setting of this movie with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys steals the show this tranquility however is broken by data an android who reveals to the ba ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies the son it seems that this world is veritable fountain of youth sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in young healthy state the enterprise crew led by captain picard investigates data actions and uncovers conspiracy between the son and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba ku and plunder the planet youth restoring properties sound pretty heavy it is though this plot anything but unique and groundbreaking is undermined by the film constant barrage of humor when going after data for instance picard sings an opera piece with him this is supposed to be cute and humorous in much more funny sequence work grows large pimple on the side of his nose as result of his exposure to the ba ku homeworld pimple which his crewmates try as they might cannot avoid looking at the acting in star trek insurrection is for the most part pretty good since they ve been playing these characters for years those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean luc picard and delivers moral speech picard trademark with his usual aplomb brent spiner another fine actor plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film though the old android wishing to be human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good despite many other critics negative opinions murray abraham the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus plays the major villain ru afro well enough ru afro reminds me somewhat of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune like the baron ru afro continuously has his skin looked after it is stretched and stapled by servants in one particularly memorable scene ru afro becomes very agitated and his facial skin splits open and bleeds ru afro is no khan from star trek ii the best trek villain ever but he is much better than the forgettable dr soran from star trek generations okay promise no more comparisons donna murphy must also be noted as ba ku woman anij who picard falls in love with murphy is not young woman with supermodel body she is mature woman with an attractive countenance this is the type of woman whom picard for those who know the character well would be enchanted with in fact the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here particular plot point involving anij ability to slow time down an ability which she shares with picard becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie for as good as the actors and setting were star trek insurrection special effects were surprisingly disappointing they proved adequate sometimes barely for 1990s mainstream science fiction film but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars the phantom menace trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships in particular seemed trite and unsuspenseful and the final confrontation between picard and ru afro took place on completely unconvincing interior of satellite the new enterprise itself only seen in this film and its predecessor remains largely unexplored though its exterior doesn look quite right for reason cannot explain despite star trek insurrection frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects enjoyed the film it maintains roddenberry largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors particularly star trek first contact though don get me wrong the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully recommend insurrection as matinee film for saturday afternoon especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general rated pg can see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience young or old
welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings prime example of this is 1999 10 things hate about you which was basically the taming of the shrew in high school less successful was last year adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp here the setting was the corporate world of new york now comes faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare tragedies like 10 things hate about you the stage is high school private prep school where odin james mekhi phifer is the on court general the basketball team standout player julia stiles featured in 10 things hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke hamlet plays desi brable odin girlfriend whose father also happens to be dean of the institution josh hartnett pearl harbor is on hand for the villainy playing the scheming hugo who sets the tragic wheels in motion was actually filmed couple of years ago but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy the movie directed by tim blake nelson best known for his co starring role in brother where art thou and written by brad kaaya is very grim an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits and that is how it should be of all of shakespeare tragedies othello is the most harrowing not because of any body count but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery kaaya profane filled script after all these are high school kids does offer hugo subtle motive of sorts the young man considers himself the basketball team prime utility man who does little bit of everything pass shoot rebound but is constantly in the shadow of odin plus his father the team coach played with ferocious intensity by martin sheen showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood the script follows the familiar lines of the classic hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi fidelity eroding the star confidence in those he considers closest to him affecting both his relationships and his game it all ends in blood of course which is why the movie was originally shelved the performances in vary phifer is at first cocky and self assured emotions he handles with ease he also does quite well displaying odin darker side his defensive sensitivity about being the only siyah at the institution his growing distrust of those he loved his rage and the erosion of his belief system hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit turning friend against friend and lover against lover stiles seems bit stilted but occasionally also rises to the occasion moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight the film does contain few missteps subplot involving hugo theft of the school mascot is left hanging also desi actions concerning michael andrew keegan odin former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo machinations is puzzling why she would continually be seen with michael however innocent the circumstances when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back it is irrational but these are minor carpings overall is stylish and faithful adaptation if nothing else it may encourage some people to read the original text and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature
feel no hesitation in saying that there something about mary is the best film that will see all year from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture there was no doubt in my mind that had seen masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998 it is that good of film when gene siskel said this about fargo only few months into 96 dismissed the notion as ridiculous how could you possibly know that film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it but after seeing the farrelly hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork now know what siskel was talking about once in very great while film comes along that is so daring so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end you just want to stand up and cheer and you know at that instant that you have just experienced something very special now for the shocker mary is the grossest and most disgusting film have ever viewed pink flamingos obviously notwithstanding the movie is so rude and guess inappropriate in nature that had hard time sitting in theater watching it with my parents luckily had seen it before them so could warn the about what they were in for forget blazing saddles animal house and even the former king of gross out comedy monty python meaning of life they were all only preludes to the farrelly assault on the senses in fact this may even be the funniest film ve ever had the pleasure of seeing the only real contender is monty python and the holy grail and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade but as funny as it is something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of mary it has huge heart you see the farrelly are truly gifted filmmakers they don just present you with string of dick and fart jokes although there are plenty to go around they also very wisely add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses it funny though if you just look at an outline of the story it seems kind of contrived and predictable but believe me it is anything but ben stiller plays ted very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe mary cameron diaz after he sticks up for her retarded brother warren early brown the cameraman believe it or not from scream his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom in one of the film funniest scenes something goes wrong won ruin it for those who know nothing about the film and ted is unable to face mary ever again jump to the present after years of self loathing ted finally hires private detective pat healy suitably slimy matt dillon to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school healy finds that mary is still full blown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself admittingly the basic story line leaves little to be desired after all with not really all that funny premise how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours somehow the farrelly pull it off the performances here are also right on target as ted stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating as he would normally be but very lovable and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons but the actor who really grabs your attention is earl brown as mary brother no other actor has even come close to playing mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here know he won be nominated but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february as good as the actors are though it the directors movie all the way guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielberg wwii epic saving private ryan and yes that is great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting but which is harder making great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can breath for minutes at time ll let you decide that one for yourself but this critic is sticking to his guns there is just something about mary
the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas has made the film out to be comedy and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one it 1971 and the hippie movement has left behind quite few wash outs among them journalist raoul duke johnny depp and his attorney dr gonzo benito del toro these two spend most of the film in drug induced stupor having strange hallucinations trashing their hotel rooms and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path duke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas but gets lost in blur of drugs beer and flying dust and ends up wandering around with no clue who won he leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back in what can only be described as strangely appropriate twist of fate to cover drug enforcement conference fear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs it doesn even in the beginning while the pair antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first the humor here is still fairly dark director terry gilliam views them with rather satirical eye and even when we re laughing we re laughing at them rather than with them they spend most of their time paranoid angry or just plain befuddled which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles the siyah comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen but it probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first hand all this aside was starting to grow bit restless as the film drew near its one hour mark thinking to myself that wanted something more out of this than just an off kilter satire of drug culture thankfully the script delivers it before too long as duke in rare moment of lucidity stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie riding the wave of something that seemed special and important now it six years later and the wave has finally broken as he puts it materialistic culture is still alive and well and for most of this film right in his face in las vegas the american dream of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever the social protesters have lost and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in sea of drugs and disillusionment in many ways fear and loathing is gilliam most reality based film all of his others with the exception of the fisher king have made use of some sort of fantasy or science fiction plot elements yet it is his off the wall masterpiece brazil to which this film bears the most visual resemblance the protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by plastic soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks and similarly duke world is composed of the artificial empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations unlike the protagonist of brazil however duke is not particularly admirable figure and neither is gonzo during the latter half of the film their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse eventually building up to an incident an diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates waitress while duke though he doesn seem to approve doesn do anything to stop it either by the time this scene takes place they don seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more they just seem like couple of stoned jerks in diner duke seems to realize at some level that he become something he doesn like but he either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change this film has taken critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience while gilliam may have overdone it in few places think he and his co writers deserve more credit than that there plenty of substance here particularly in the second half its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the 60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren usually very pleasant unlike say brazil or the fisher king both of which feature character who dares to let himself dream in repressive environment fear and loathing in las vegas shows us someone who given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs in its own psychedelic whacked out way it sad and regretful but think it also bit of kick in the pants challenge to find an alternative between chemically induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas style materialism indeed duke himself admits at one point that he never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them not sure if he any closer to accepting it by the end or not but suspect the audience will get the idea
along his carreer mel gibson has collected several successes not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view for all that think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart the australian actor decided to produce and direct film about sir william wallace popular scotch hero of the 13th century where he would also perform the principal role accepting so huge challenge mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years with suppoosed failure just to see recognized by everyone all his potentialities and that way to consolidate his position in hollywood it was definitely an enormous risk but sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face braveheart is in fact magnificent and magisterial film for three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative rhyitm which never gives place to single moment of monotony or uninterest the william wallace story is the story of so many others brave liberty defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value along the centuries seeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression william wallace dares to face the powerful edward king of england in war by the autonomy of scotland as the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up his courage and inteligence are admired by everyone including the princess isabelle of wales wife of edward son however william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty nowadays mel gibson directs with lot of brilliancy brilliant cast patrick mcgoohan has very nice performance as edward the king longshank the scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good sophie marceau as princess isabelle has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart also liked the performances of angus macfadyen as robert the bruce and of course mel gibson as william wallace however think this time the mel gibson work as director was much better than his work as actor the excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is when we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes view by the camera of john toll then we realize all the beauty of this film braveheart is in my opinion one of the best movies of 1995 ve heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be new david lean for now let see if braveheart equalizes the oscars of lawrence of arabia it won be easy it gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson
three things learned from being john malkovich when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 2th floor of building always bring your crowbar don stand in the way of your wife actualization as man and whenever entering portal into the mind of another human being wear old clothes because hey it muddy in there being john malkovich is the most original film to come down the pike in very long time wildly surrealistic yet presented in down to earth funky style this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head after savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it from the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself there lot to think about here just don forget to have fun clearly all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did starting with writer charles kaufman wrote being john malkovich without an outline he explains in the press notes blindly with no sense of direction or purpose it important to me that don have map before start this allows me to surprise myself stay engaged discover things and hopefully allow the unconscious to surface spike jonze mark wahlberg na ve buddy in three kings takes it from there the white hot director of the beastie boy sabotage an award winning parody of 70s tv cop shows as well as numerous other music videos and commercials eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film debut jonze wisely realized that storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in low key style his flat matter of fact approach works perfectly and then there the cast john cusack plays control freak craig schwartz street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive but decidedly erotic puppet shows over the years his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte cameron diaz has devolved once passionate lovers the two are now little more than courteous roommates financially strapped craig takes job as an entry level file clerk at lestercorp located on the 2th floor of manhattan building navigating around dr lester orson bean his 105 year old boss and floris mary kay place lester dotty secretary craig tries to settle into his new position but two things keep him distracted first there the beautiful and imperious maxine catherine keener who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her and then there the hole behind the file cabinet which turns out to be portal into the mind of actor john malkovich craig learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the subconscious of malkovich where they can experience life from his point of view with enough concentration you can even influence his actions after 15 minutes the visitor gets ejected and unceremoniously dumped in ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike then things get little weird by the way if you re concerned that gave away too much of the plot rest assured barely scratched the surface one of the most satisfying aspects of the fable is that kaufman is not content to simply milk laughs from his bizarre set up instead he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical implications of compromising another person identity he also examines the consequences of the malko visits to craig lotte maxine and of course john malkovich himself the performances are superb malkovich best known to mainstream audiences for his work in dangerous liaisons in the line of fire and as head psychopath in the guilty pleasure con air tweaks his own image in dandy self deprecating turn far from his effete vaguely reptilian persona this malkovich is just another schlub drinking with his pals and trying to get laid incidentally charlie sheen also plays himself in hilarious parody of his well earned bad boy reputation as always john cusack nails his part handily pulling viewers along even as craig actions become unconscionable the big surprises come from catherine keener and cameron diaz both playing against type kenner usually cast in icy subordinate roles is terrific as highly intelligent extremely manipulative femme fatale cameron diaz barely recognizable under mess of brown curly hair sheds her perpetually sunny smile and draws big laughs as woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion after taking ride in malkovich being john malkovich stumbles towards the end as jonze and kaufman try too hard to resolve the various subplots additional characters and increasingly complex explanations lead to cluttered finale regardless this contemporary alice in wonderland is real treat enjoyed watching being john malkovich but only later after reflecting on the film did its resonance fully hit me at one point craig says do you know what metaphysical can of worms this portal is truer words were never spoken
another independent film this comedy which was brought by miramax for $5 million is good fun favreau and vaughn the lost world jurassic park 1997 play mike and trent two everyday 20somethings on the lookout for women the film just basically follows their plight on the lookout for lurve and along the way we get to meet some of their friends see their attempts at chatting up girls and just basically get insight into their lives and all of this is great fun swingers doesn rely on huge special effects or big name stars to provide entertainment no it just has great script and superb little known actors the script by favreau is great mike is always missing is girlfriend who hasn called him for six months and every time he meets girl he always end up telling her about the ex the audience feels for this pathetic little man thanks to the great script vaughn is the money swingers speak for the best as the womanizing trent always on the lookout for new girl some of his chat up lines are awful but he always seems to get the girl thanks to his hard man nature vaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film towards the end in diner the conversations that go on between mike and trent are great but it never quite reaches tarantino standards which suspect the film was trying to reach there are some excellent laugh out loud jokes in the film and some superbly funny set pieces such as favreau cringe worhy battle with answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence embarrassing to him hilarious to the audience mike trents friends are also good although there characters seem bit underwritten and we never really learn as much as we would like about them although this is primarily mike and trents film it would of been nice to learn bit more about their friends they just seem to wander aimlessly in the background but again the lines they say are usually pretty good and they do have some funny parts it just shame that they didn have more meatier roles the acting is superb as said above vaughn is superb as trent he definitely the best thing in the film favreau is also good acting as the little man very well and the way he always feels sorry for himself is very funny graham boogie nights 1997 has small but good role as lorraine girl mike finally falls in love with she hardly features in the film at all but she still manages to make an impact on the audience swingers then is funny but it does have some flaws firstly the running time is bit too short the film comes to an abrupt halt and actually wanted the film to carry on longer it never really comes to satisfying conclusion which is shame as most films are too long also this type of film has been done too many times such as sleep with me 1994 but these small flaws don really spoil what is funny entertaining comedy
star wars episode the phantom menace review review by jamey hughton stars starring liam neeson ewan mcgregor natalie portman and jake lloyd director george lucas rated with all the hype that star wars episode the phantom menace has been receiving it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film the movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever with marketing campaign so strong it has brought colonel sanders the taco bell chihuahua and pizza hut together can george lucas succeed yet again with transporting us back long time ago in galaxy far far away yes this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch with amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity but that doesn mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment the phantom menace features the most eye catching jaw dropping visual look in cinematic history the tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest and the special effects are nothing short of the best and most plentiful to ever be caught on film the vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this project is astounding the phantom menace is delectable feast for the senses even if it has some disappointing aspects after we re treated to the famous prologue in the sky with john williams thundering score we meet qui gon jonn liam neeson and young obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor jedi master and his trainee `padawan they are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters for the evil trade federation and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet of naboo oh but enough about that the prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker jake lloyd into the picture as you already know this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter this particular race is the most exciting energetic high octane action sequence that you ll ever see one of the delights of the series is meeting the newest set of strange alien creatures that lucas has devised and the phantom menace is no exception loved sebulba the rat like scoundrel whom anakin has to face in the pod race and boss nass the leader of the gungans who are neighbouring species to naboo one character who has been subject to criticism is jar jar binks member of the gungan race jar jar speaks like roger rabbit on hallucinogenic drug and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief yes he is initially annoying but can admit to laughing over some of his harmless goofy antics there is some lack of dramatic pull in this star wars entry but the presentation almost makes you forget the plot and character lapses the final light saber battle between the jedi and the horrific and terminally underused villain darth maul is spectacular to behold jabba the hutt yoda 3po and r2 d2 have cameo appearances lucas has not forget how to captivate an audience even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness one can only wonder what the possible technology will present for the next two installments episode and ii when they arrive you ll know where to find me
after indecent proposal and up close and personal redford was wise to direct himself in picture at last redford may look great on screen but over the past few years he proven himself bigger talent behind the camera ordinary people is one of the best films of the nineteen eighties and it was the first picture he helmed while the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magic realism with um realism and ve never been much of fan of river runs through it to the chagrin of many quiz show was dazzling energetic and convincing the horse whisperer represents both his directorial return to nature films and the first time in that sub genre redford seems equally concerned with humans and scenery scott thomas plays annie maclean an uptight but respected new york magazine editor whose daughter grace johanssen loses leg and good friend when an early morning ride climaxes with their horses colliding with semi grace horse survived but barely and has gone mad annie refuses to put the animal out of his misery believing that if the horse heals it will mend grace newly broken spirit eventually mother and daughter travel alone to montana to be with tom booker redford famed horse whisperer who has gift of calming horses with simple looks and touches leaving busy husband neill behind eventually they move onto the booker ranch with the rest of tom family and annie finds herself falling in love with all things montana including naturally tom the wise and lonely trainer the horse whisperer is delicately made dare say lyrical since to many people ear that word is synonymous with boring hardly the horse whisperer has little to offer in the way of surprise but it does have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch especially in the final third of the story scott thomas and johanssen seem like mother and daughter and you have no doubt believing that the mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under spell especially since robert richardson photography casts montana as heaven on earth gimmicky but effective technique the filmmakers employ is switch in aspect ratio from squarish to widescreen when the central location shifts from new york to montana the underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt emotive performance as the nice guy husband who is as authoritive and likeable as tom he is indeed refreshing change from the sexist lout of husband so many writers resort to as short cut for explaining away the cheating spouse motivation unfortunately one of the horse whisperer only flaws is the chemistry between would be lovers scott thomas and redford liked both of them but didn necessarily believe that redford would fall for such cold fish even if the countryside air thawed her slightly luckily and curiously this is such rich and textured movie that it doesn quite matter their adultery seems like an afterthought the obligatory sub plot that ties many of the characters complex relationships together
was born in 1970 which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons tracks and disco however since was 17 years old ve seen more than my share of adult films mention this only because thinks its important to state up front that not against pornogrpahy ve seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available director paul thomas anderson boogie nights offers us view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema the mid to late 70s this was the period when rated movies were real movies shot on film shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films films that attempted to tell real story one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how like in an any other billion dollar industry the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete in this case the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette burt reynold manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur known as jack horner horner has steady family of performers some of whom live in his plush home but in the world of porn performers are commodity the fresher the better when horner scouts fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque he decides to add him to his stable it is pairing that leads to meteoric rise and fall for young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his as directed by anderson the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door boogie nights provides voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of hardcore film scene but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends the downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut by the film final image what we we once found titillating has now become grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams boogie nights is not about sex it does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers in fact the film isn really about pornography at all pornography is merely the setting to tell compelling story about lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub culture to find acceptance of who they are the film goes to brilliant often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world yet like in the lauded tarantino films these people still have their own moral code their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively the characters we meet are like road map of dysfuntion first stop the den mother julianne moore in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son second stop the cuckold crewman william macy who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real life porn star nina hartley but the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams eddie is blessed with natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it with no real ambition of his own he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame his alcoholic mother clearly dissatisfied with her own lot abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house horner introduces him to amber waves moore who immediately adopts him nuclear family is born the surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her babies provides some of the films most poignant scenes clearly she is not even fit to manage her own life let alone nurture these lost children but the need to love and be loved is so strong they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to even the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in real family then again perhaps its not so different from real families at all eddie adams who later takes on the screen name dirk diggler is skillfully acted by former pop star mark wahlberg say former pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job this is bold and brave territory for such young man he pulls it off marvelously wahlberg is big bright star with big bright future boogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt without the first amendment preachiness its intimate studies of character make it the superior film wahlberg surprising performance is on par with woody harrelson but in my opinion boogie nights is not the best film of the year got the feeling that itus hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance still if the subject matter of this film intimidates you thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway ya know kinda like disco
once again the battle is dreamworks versus disney earlier this year the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end of the world asteroid flicks deep impact and armageddon here we are now just few months later and they re at it again with dueling bug movies antz and bug life what find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution mean come on what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer animated films about bugs as was the case with the meteor movies disney has come out on top though antz is likable movie bug life is far superior in fact this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz became immersed in the world of bug life while antz just made me scrutinize everything but it not really fair to base an entire review on comparison bug life is remarkable film in its own right and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer animated film about bugs in fact it one of the best films this year it smart subtle and funny but it also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining haven had such good time at the movies in months it tells the story of an ant named flick voice by dave foley he nice guy but he also troublemaker the ants spend all season putting together the offering big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers just before the grasshoppers come flick accidentally knocks over the offering and ruins everything for the entire colony the grasshopper leader hopper kevin spacey is enraged and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer or they re all dead flick feeling responsible for this sets off to look for help he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them he heads to the city the city being house few miles away where he finds colorful bunch of circus bugs ladybug denis leary who is spectacular siyah widow bonnie hunt caterpillar joe ranft butterfly madeline kahn rhinoceros beetle michael mcshane and stick david hyde pierce also giving hilarious performance flick doesn know they re actors and they don know that flick needs them to kill bunch of grasshoppers so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position the most obvious element of bug life is the quality of animation created by pixar the same people who brought us toy story bug life has some of the most amazing visuals ve ever seen the bugs seem to inhabit three dimensional space and occasionally there will be shot that is indistinguishable from live action this is lush colorful world full of life and imagination the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives matches bottlecaps tin cans etc and make them active objects in the bugs world is innovative the film is also mercilessly exciting particularly in superbly staged scene involving our heroes escape from bird little bird never seemed so huge and threatening but the makers of bug life know where the importance lies story and characters flick with solid voice work from foley is great guy to lead the story but the real treat comes with the circus bugs they re such likable group of characters the standouts are the stick hyde pierce is so good francis the ladybug and the big fat caterpillar all of these bugs have more than token personality which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs and it also keeps the tear jerking scenes from seeming obligatory in my review of antz said that the film is clever cop out because it presents bunch of little humans reacting to an ant like existence in concept bug life is basically the same movie except that was never given enough time to find things that didn like about it with such strong work in both animation and script bug life is nothing but joy to sit through it really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie but bug life is so good that sure it will find its audience after slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies it downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty
dimension films scream distributor has asked press to say extremely little if anything about the film twisty plot that no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here but will do my best to be vague now there first the first one was [good] but all the rest sucked said cinematically savvy teen in last winter wes craven thriller scream her statement referring to the films of the nightmare on elm street series but really putting down franchise overkill in general the comment certainly carries clout for every truly great sequel there appears to be couple of duds making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas but like it or not along comes scream and believe it or not it doozy slick sinister madly subversive good time at the movies as intent on sending up hollywood sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions scream is definitely that rare movie thing follow up that can stand along side its original with pride it been two years since pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch esque get ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro california those surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives plucky heroine sidney prescott neve campbell is drama student at the midwestern windsor college her pop culture whiz pal randy meeks jamie kennedy has tagged along trash tabloid reporter gale weathers courteney cox has written best seller based on their ordeal the basis of which has been turned into very bad movie called stab and dewey riley david arquette still suffering from wounds inflicted during scream has left his job as police officer for while life is tranquil at least for while several sudden murders bring sidney randy gale and dewey together again but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings if these four people learned anything from the past it to trust no one thus the possible victim potential killer list includes said quartet as well as derek jerry connell sidney new beau cici sara michelle gellar chatty sorority gal joel duane martin gale cameraman who not too thrilled with her blood soaked past hallie elise neal sidney sassy roommate debbie laurie metcalf local reporter who gives gale some not too friendly competition and mickey timothy olyphant randy good friend and fellow film student cotton weary liev schreiber the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother murder in scream also shows up on campus but why like the first scream craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with bang this time it an extended sequence that finds an african american couple jada pinkett and omar epps attending sneak preview of stab making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non roles of blacks in slasher cinema before tragedy ensues at the screening the movie within movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments including scene from stab which turns scream now famous drew barrymore prologue on its ear hang up the phone and star 69 his pinkett yells at the screen it funny creepy stuff don think ll ever feel safe in movie theater again that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road another flawless example of this is riotous cell phone assault of the killer on randy dewey and gale in broad daylight it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters there are other superb set pieces but explaining them risks ruining their effect there are more players this time around as to provide both higher number suspects and staggering body count it something of trade in the new characters are too large in number to be as fully developed as the original scream gang but this movie packs in knowing performances especially by kennedy and cox and more death for your dollar it can be argued that while the original might outclass it by tad scream is both scarier and funnier it certainly doesn skimp with shocks major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart actually questioned craven and williamson judgment here considering how much this person has added to these films sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab the two scenes we re shown are dead on but for film fans there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like the usual suspects aliens and the empire strikes back still scream does so many things right it petty to quibble its penchant for parody is irresistible discussions of the merits of film sequels and all the attractive solid cast is definite bonus and the denouement while not as shocking as scream is priceless the film final revelation incorporates bits of particular horror film prominently referred to in scream with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper all this and scream is in the works knowing the series tendency for self reference perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice mentioning scream ll help them in their argument
when someone journeys to the theater to see comedy he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space it really is too bad that comedies are so hit and miss because when moviegoer goes in theater expecting to be amused it really is shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver but weep not dear readers because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than sure bet austin powers the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things ve had the pleasure to see in long time completely looney delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks if all comedies or even half or what am saying even fifth of them could be this consistently hysterical would take up residence at my local multiplex even more to this movie credit is the fact that it is sequel to the 1997 sleeper cult hit austin powers international man of mystery the original came out of nowhere it was low budget eccentric movie that many expected to flop like leslie nielsen parody all of sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america ironically powers yeeeeah baby yeah has almost become an icon of the late 90s thus another installment was inevitable but it also undoubtedly welcome the spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained over the top comedies have ever seen in my entire life it brings back most of the characters from its predecessor even if only briefly and adds new ones austin powers mike myers swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo oh you ll figure it out which dr evil meyers again has stolen he enlists the help of gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in hilarious opening sequence played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr evil yet again surprisingly the real star is dr evil rather than austin he gets most of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie perhaps this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately instead of being the scheming villainous mad scientist we might expect from character like this he is bumbling often sweet mad scientist wannabe the spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the original but that okay by me because the original left us wanting more by the time that one was over we haven had nearly our share of shag jokes crude puns and powers antics and this sequel satisfies our appetites even by its conclusions still not sure ve had my fill of bits like do you smoke after sex don know baby never looked this may seem awfully immature of me but understand that the austin powers series unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days is genuinely funny don know if ve ever laughed harder at any movie than did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious just the two of us rendition by dr evil and his new miniature clone named mini me don have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort indeed there is little beyond the joy viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did but as far as concerned that is enough 1999 eugene novikov &#137
contact pg there moment late in robert zemeckis contact where was reminded of why started writing movie reviews in the first place we see scientist dressed in silvery space suit walking tentatively across narrow walkway leading inside compact spherical space pod unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops anticipation excitement anxiety fear the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character nervously breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead it is this sense of discovery the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical captivating entertainment jodie foster stars as dr ellie arroway brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals and mean life after losing her entire family when she was young the only thing occupying ellie world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport from this synopsis contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact but there is whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci fi hook the alien contact angle generates great amount of suspense and awe but perhaps more than anything else contact is character study of ellie whose obsession with empirical scientific evidence has erased all belief in higher power the irony is that while admitting to having no religious faith she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes in sense religion in its own right it would be easy for scripters james hart and michael goldenberg in trying to paint positive image of the heroine to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones but they wisely eschew easy answers giving equal time to both sides and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane in the end there is no right or wrong nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other even slightly so there are just two very viable points of view each with their own merits each with their own faults the complex role of ellie is an actress dream and foster virtual shoo in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year more than rises to the challenge she conveys intelligence determination warmth and in gutsy move always on edge we root for ellie and feel for her but we also feel at times that she goes too far contact is clearly foster vehicle but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles matthew mcconaughey who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss however his main storyline the tentative palmer ellie romance is the film weakest subplot john hurt is effectively creepy as hadden the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as beyaz house aide rachel constantine most memorable of all though are tom skerritt and james woods who play rival scientist dr david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz respectively both especially skerritt embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances zemeckis comes off of his three year break in top shape always known as director of effects laden extravaganzas it comes as no surprise that contact visual effects are quite stunning the central space journey is more than little reminiscent of the close of 2001 space odyssey but with more advanced technology at his disposal zemeckis voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick yet more wondrously pure and zemeckis doesn resist the urge to use the always interesting incorporate actors into existing film footage effect which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump effects however are confined to only few scenes and clearly take back seat to the drama emotion and pure wonder which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump it says lot that in summer science fiction film such as this it not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised the thought provoking two hour plus contact is much welcome change of pace from summer no brainers but the fact that it is smart film does not mean that it also isn entertaining for all the interesting questions it asks the film is still what it being sold as journey to the heart of the universe and what fascinating unforgettable journey it is
after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project making the third installment in the godfather trilogy this new film has been underrated for no reason it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla pervious films it is also more psychological pessimistic and more tragic than the first two the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some unfinished developments of some characters the film elegantly begins with nino rota recognizable musical score the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael voice as he is writing letter to his children the only wealth in this world is children more than all money and power on earth you are my treasure the year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of part ii to make his father dream come true making the corleone family legitimate michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling constantly haunted by the past his only reason to live is his children the family has amassed unimaginable wealth and as the film opens michael corleone al pacino is being invested with great honor by the church later that day at reception his daughter announces corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily check in the amount of $100 million but the corleones are about to find as others have throughout history that you cannot buy forgiveness sure you can do business with evil men inside the church for all men are fallible and capable of sin but god does not take payoffs the plot of the movie concocted by coppola and mario puzo in screenplay inspired by headlines brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican there is moment in godfather iii where michael says all my life have been trying to go up in society where everything was legal but the higher go the crookier it becomes visually this film is as spectacular as the first two gordon willis rich cinematography carmine copolla beautiful composition and alex tavoularis wonderful art direction could not be better but copolla first two godfather films were more famous for their deep intellectual plots tree dimensional characters and incredible acting than for their visual perfection the third installment has only the plot and visuals some characters could be much more developed and the acting although good never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie that could have been grander and more emotional the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino who should have got nomination for best actor at the oscars andy garcia is powerful as sonny son strong focused and loyal violence is natural to him he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family behalf and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was however both kay diane keaton and connie talia shire are useless and characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed the good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends that you remember from the first and second films in the third film michael has become almost like his father vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger this parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo character was more developed many have pointed out that making the third film was unnecessary disagree it is beautiful film of great importance completing the tragic saga of the corleone family the first film showed some horrible results of corleone life it showed michael making choice the second showed man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times man desperately trying to keep his balance focus family and sanity while everything is crashing all around him the third film is terrifying conclusion result of michael life the life he chose for himself is like quicksand one wrong step and you are doomed there is no turning back and no matter how hard you try to get out of it to free yourself no matter how powerful and wealthy you are you are helpless sinking deeper and deeper till it swallows you completely the beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film when michael is sitting alone in his chair left by everyone surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and family members long dead here he dies alone miserable and unforgiven
there must be some unwritten rule that states one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom even if it is foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere in the exotic morocco of 1972 25 year old english hippie mother julia winslet of two sweet young girls the year old lucy carrie and the year old bea bella has arrived for year stay with the self absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for change of life from her unfaithful poet husband she is not officially married to him and her cold one room london flat and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech at least she says she is as she is making some attempt to contact sufi sheikh there who has all the answers she has not planned things out too carefully having no money and the trip doesn seem like it much fun more like misadventure with some romance with local moroccan thrown in drugs world wide youthful phenomena during this period where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the good life cheaply and to be in spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities even though drugs are illegal there but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here in this film the subject of drugs is never broached only hinted at in an off handed but slurring way as the hippie commune is shown in negative light strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons to follow the mystical sufis seem lost following culture that is far different from where they were coming from the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud grand daughter esther freud who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister it is written by the director brother who has previously directed regeneration the playboys and trojan eddie the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls with julia strapped for cash and not receiving needed check her husband often forgets to send her she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria so instead she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar bilal said taghmaoui he becomes her lover taking the place of her husband as father figure for the girls the girls readily accept him and there is no big to do made about their openly sexual relationship but the girls really don know what to make of the relationship it especially bothers bea who is embarrassed by her mother loose attitude and wants to go home things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village it seems only that bilal charm is matched by his shiftlessness as he has wife who still lives there this scene didn make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people also but doubt that the family is now stuck without money in backward area trying to decide what to do next as they hitch ride away from there with truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel lucy takes it all in stride and has good disposition for travel while bea just wants to go to school and learn something and be normal girl the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes expansive views illustrious mosques and grand sunsets kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be westerner living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences as many drop out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves the family travel which is on the edge has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting but when she gets up all there is is this splendid emptiness all around her and vacuous life that is starting to bother her that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her is starting to wear thin in her thoughts it will dawn on her when bea takes ill as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got chance to see him the new guru is grounded in reality something she is not grounded in and seems to tell her what she couldn comprehend from anyone else even comforting her by telling her that her tears are memories gift from god the film weakness was the empty feeling got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia the storyline about helpless single parent detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby boom generation had during their trip to morocco who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism teaching that has lot to offer its followers contrary to the impression the film might give seemed to pass her by her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep at best she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along smoking some hashish and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like hippie and she wouldn have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey after all the mystical trip is the journey the film strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are and no one is that good or that bad or judged too harshly for their shortcomings bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity the little girls are precocious but they are lovable julia the cornerstone the film is built on is mother who cares about the children but doesn know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them she was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she at this is very freudian way to look at things as this sudden realization that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey at least for the time being and after all is said and done who to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences just like she probably was
when was asked to see this movie with friend my initial reaction was not hugh grant was perhaps wrong to be so harsh but after his insidious flirtation with street hooker just could not picture him in any romantic lead what makes this movie wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh but because it stars julia and carries with it brilliantly written script this writer richard curtis whose exceptional first work four weddings and funeral shows us that he is master in the domain of the romantic comedy with splashes of drama thrown in between hugh and his hair is almost identical to the character that made him famous in four weddings he plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck unfortunately he is type cast in this role but fortunately it works well for him in this movie if only he would dither little less julia knows this role well the glamorous movie star who is searching for true love there are moments in this movie that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness how sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful but to have no one to share it with the writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels how differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such harsh environment how the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice
it was only matter of time before dilbert esque office comedy hit the screens however rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams office space is instead based on the work of another animator mike judge creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill in his live action directoral debut judge aptly spoofs corporate culture the story is certainly not very involved but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps peter ron livingston is programmer working at the initech corporation every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before in other words every day is the worst day in his entire life he stuck in boring job with eight different supervisors all obsessed with administrative trivialities he smitten with joanna jennifer aniston local waitress but hasn the guts to even introduce himself everything has simply made him complete nervous wreck but all of that changes when after an unintentionally over effective visit to hypnotherapist peter loses all of his inhibitions he realizes his lifelong dream to do absolutely nothing he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss bill lumbergh gary cole doing whatever he feels like peter friends and co workers samir ajay naidu and michael bolton david herman no not that michael bolton are perplexed by their friend sudden change in attitude but they have larger things to worry about rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing as bleak as much of this sounds let me assure you that office space is comedy and quite funny one although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life each mundane detail taken by itself seems completely regrettably plausible yet when combined into whole the picture which results is absolutely surreal ron livingston tackles his role straight faced and becomes much funnier because of it his character isn simply being clown lampooning around the office but rather seems possessed by zen like clarity he is operating on higher plane where everything suddenly makes sense and from this vantage point he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film in fact in addition to being wildly humorous the film may actually prove to be cathartic the animated roots of office space show in the film lack of complexity most of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by particular personality quirk one employee milton stephen root is practically flesh and blood cartoon however despite their simple nature the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny it not required to have corporate background to enjoy this film though the situations may seem exceedingly far fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are the film is flimsy and absurd but also very funny
if beavis and butthead had favorite movie from dusk till dawn would probably be it scripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez desperado the movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence and is incredibly fun to watch it starts off as pulp fiction type crime story with criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing convenience store because this is tarantino movie however it not just case of pull the gun and take the loot it case of hole being shot through someone hand man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie everything overdone and nothing as it seems clooney and tarantino bring hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with family in it harvey keitel plays the backslidden ex preacher and juliette lewis his daughter whom registered sex pervert tarantino eyes endlessly you know you re mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive although she not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn the first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying to get to and through the mexico border clooney strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on the toilet it does its trick the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind never noticing clooney or tarantino once they get to mexico it time to wait at the rendezvous point topless bar called titty twister where we re once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of stripper finally after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots and clooney forcing keitel and lewis to drink with him the stripper turns into vampire soon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back that right we ve come all this way to see vampire movie but like everything else tarantino takes this age old genre and twists it to his own ends to produce over the top entertainment so we get holy water condom balloons heads rolling quadruple impalement on an overturned table and keitel getting bitten by vampire and announcing he only has few minutes left before he becomes lap dog of satan the from dusk till dawn dialogue is 100% tarantino hovering between absurd and disgusting as when they re entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister but always entertaining and is huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of being one more second rate gorefest clooney keitel and especially tarantino are so over the top with their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people even if there absolutely no message or meaning to from dusk till dawn pulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for reason but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment from dusk till dawn isn the classic of modern cinema that pf is but is does prove you can do good job making really bad movie
not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective few years ago have seen film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets lies like bergman director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations also like bergman leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters ravished and wracked faces and the prominent mournfulness of cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman own use of bach cello suite in an earlier film all that is missing is discussion of god which is not to say that secrets lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master in fact it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind nonetheless what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place that it takes some effort to adjust to the film rhythms once the adjustment is made however there are great rewards one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is though leigh may have adopted some of bergman stylistic touches most obviously in an early scene of terse cross cutting during married couple strained conversation as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any style at all whereas bergman uses artifice as tool to expose reality leigh makes the camera mere observer almost as in pbs documentary the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors it is tribute to everyone involved that despite such scrutiny only infrequently are we aware that anyone is acting much has been made of brenda blethyn performance and rightly so but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching fiction that you realize how good she is there are few missteps for one except for one scene tragicomic as it happens there is scant humor in the film this leads to certain monotonous tone throughout and occasionally as with bergman the bluntness of the situations can seem forced for all that this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film in fact it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it there is even sweet but significant irony in the film unspoken take on race relations something an american audience at least would do well to observe nonetheless secrets lies is not for the faint of heart though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen needless to say it is also very depressing at times but for many of us of course so is life and though the film is too honest to tack on phony happy ending that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better
city of angels is the kind of love story that enjoy the most thought provoking moving and completely unsentimental find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant which is film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality city of angels is wonderful film enhanced by interesting and well rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years it love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story and avoids most of the cliches we re so used to seeing in films like this city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders 1988 film wings of desire have yet to see wings of desire so am unfortunately unable to make comparison of the two have heard however that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways which makes me glad that this film isn rip off of its source material nicolas cage stars as seth an angel who like all of his angel counterparts is present to lead the dying to heaven or somewhere just like it one day he is forced to take the life of patient of dr maggie rice meg ryan and his attention is called to her the angels can make themselves seen to humans but they can experience any of the senses most importantly touch he shows himself to maggie and she falls for him unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status seth wants to become human so he can feel her that when he meets nathaniel messinger dennis franz former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race as side note found messinger to be the most fascinating character for can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel know it sounds ridiculous but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well done after much deliberation she tells him that she could only be with man who can feel this of course is when seth decides to take the plunge literally from building when he wakes up from the fall he is human and happy to feel what it like to have split lip and blood oozing from his forehead since love this film so much ll make minor note that it certainly isn perfect although it is original and mesmerizing it does fall prey to few of the cliches of the genre the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic though the details are what make the story excellent and steel has done great job with them the ending too could have been more powerful and less predictable these elements are minor though and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels the acting is superb from everyone involved this is perhaps my second favorite performance from cage my favorite being the rock he quiet and pensive and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly toned words he perfect for role like this and at the same time he reassures us he not bound by playing the psycho though he is good at it as he shows in face off meg ryan is powerful enticing and appealingly chirpy actress and her work here is some of her best dennis franz however steals all of his scenes as the energetic former angel what admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation director brad silberling is talented man and he knows that story like this is driven by the characters rather than forced sentimentality his direction is steady and he shows this in just about every scene near the beginning maggie has to tell mother and her two children that their father is dead there is no music or elaborate camera work we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information this is the way stories should be told and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real the film also appeals to the senses in way that few love stories do cinematographer john seale the english patient provides some of the most stunning images ve seen on the big screen hundreds of black clad angels stand on dim beach in the early morning hours just as an example the music by gabriel yared also of the english patient is perfect for this film it quiet and moody music but not sentimental and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far all of this adds up to film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre it film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously
in 1912 ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world and she was she was also build to be one of the most luxurious and that she was finally she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not to get ticket for this voyage you either spent life savings to get to america to start life anew were part of the upper class and had the money to spare or finally were lucky enough to have full house in poker match by the docks like jack dawson jack dawson makes the trip and happens to be at the right place at the right time rose dewitt bukater first class passenger climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping thus is started tale of romance and intrigue and tale of death and tragedy this movie is about tragic event that took place great many years ago an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia the movie titanic shows what happened maybe not with 100% degree of accuracy but it still shows it very realisticaly now the titanic is both story on its own and backdrop for story it serves as both admirably brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is but that alone is not enough the story is brought out with certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren acting but are actually the characters in the movie the casting for the movie could really have been better in my humble opinion that is one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself yes you read correctly the ship is character how is the titanic character you ask well simple ship had certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this mr cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense all this adds to the movie in certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp now to produce the effect that mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening if your imagination is good the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique the movie will leave you amazed at the effects and that is feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie just humans and an oversized ship the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions the theater that went to had few people leaving with tears in their eyes now that is not feat accomplished by most movies now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of punch wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end the historical value of this movie is quite high and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy for it is extremely well done the method of telling the story is also good maybe not totally unique but effective none the less regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing if you get the chance to see this movie go it might not be the best movie in the world but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it during none of the hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie
notice this is review and analysis of exotica the first part of this piece is the review the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers if you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so then save the second part for the discussion afterwards starring bruce greenwood mia kirshner elias kosteas don mckellar arsinee khanijian sarah polley director atom egoyan screenplay atom egoyan exotica is film that grows on retrospection exotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film all of the people know each other but apart from that there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account the director hints for possible solutions using multi line plot so popular with critics in mystery train and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction exotica reaches whole new dimension using this technique at the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features the out of chronological order technique has become ever so popular perhaps even de rigueur for biographical films similarly we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use to varying extent converging multiplots on first glance once the multi plot puzzle in exotica is solved there seems to be little left to look at but perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather commentaries on views of life exotica is very much worth seeing it opened to critic praise worldwide first saw it in mexico city last december in canada it broke records for movie of its kind which prompted the american distributor to go for wide release apart from strong plot acting is very convincing and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie the spoon fed entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie and thus it might last little on screen but if you want to try movie cut above the crowd with an originality that is ever so rare by all means see exotica analysis spoilers ahead what is behind the complex plot in exotica first common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means the lone tax auditor the repressed homosexual pet shop owner the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub the rich man which has the club remodeled the audience at the movie theatre all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul then we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people including those who sit watching exotica in that regard exotica stands for onlookers at nightclub for the rich man looking through silver mirrors and poor rich people looking at other people lives through silver screen exotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner exotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of gay person no attraction to the strip dancer and only interested on avoiding jail no personal relationship with the tax auditor in exotica everybody is watching and what is worse everybody knows second exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters the strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter the niece becomes the baby sitter the baby sitter becomes the dancer and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter the pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj by finding the proverbial daughter chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle just as everything comes around to fitting whole at the end of the movie
martin scorsese triumphant adaptation of edith wharton the age of innocence is stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do period piece in the early 1900 but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is wonder and testament to the greatness of scorsese as filmmaker this is gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese finest newland archer day lewis is prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ryder somewhat empty and shallow new yorker who belongs to prestigious family and is quite beautiful the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families in society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may countess ellen olenska pfeiffer cousin of may walks into archer life archer is immediately captivated and finds himself in love with ellen archer is also bound by the limits of new york society which is an intrusive as any other in the world archer finds himself having secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status the film subject matter may seem alien to scorsese but the theme is definitely not it is theme of forbidden romance guilty pleasures and the consequences causes because of those actions there is painstakingly flawed hero and his choice between the life he wants and the life he is destined for in truth it is film about society the audience doesn know about but wants to find out more much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun the performances are absolutely breathtaking day lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well ryder is probably the gem of the group for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot and slowly pushes day lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending the supporting cast is also wonderful with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one memory scorsese definitely has passion for filmmaking his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is wondrous sight he literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery his script is also excellent slow in buildup with rapid conclusion and fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed it is difficult to make period piece gripping scorsese however does it beautifully the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere he is patient but he films everything and anything remotely important the cameras sweep pan track and do more than they ve ever done but they are so subtle one doesn realize he watching all the scorsese hallmarks until 2nd viewing the central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot but the viewer doesn notice it because we want to see more of this gorgeous world there are few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding and joanne woodward narration is exquisite not fast film like goodfellas this shares more in common with kundun than anything else and like kundun this is slow starting film that truly shines when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end beautiful film by director continuing to challenge himself year after year
when first heard that kevin costner was making movie called the postman thought an american version of il postino starring costner god help us when found out that it was not remake of postino but an postapocalyptic epic thought landworld please god make him stop as it turns out the postman is much better film than had expected despite being set in 2013 the movie is at heart western band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back the setting however allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages the struggle of dead society to be reborn has grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it costner nameless character wandering actor rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem will patton former copy machine salesman turned bandit king our hero escapes and discovers the body of dead postman taking the uniform and bag of mail he passes himself off as representative of the restored united states he is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets one young disciple ford lincoln mercury larenz tate organizes full scale postal service ford spreads the postman message of hope until bethlehem finds that the once meek villagers are beginning to resist his rule as war breaks out between bethlehem army and the postal workers costner character steps into the legend he created and goes from self centered loner to leader of the revolution his lie of the restored united states becomes self fulfilling prophecy postman is an odd blend of bleak setting and message of wide eyed optimism sort of sergio leone meets frank capra but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling what could have been another knock off of the road warrior like waterworld was surprises the viewer with sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble tate is the stand out in the movie large cast ford lincoln mercury self named is the polar opposite of dog tate character in his debut film menace ii society 1993 and tate makes ford innocent belief in hope as convincing as dog cynicism and brutality his performance sells the movie interestingly as tate moves from his usual street smart roles to youthful optimism the soft eyed patton who usually plays nice guys proves disarming villain olivia williams makes her film debut as the postman love interest abby when they first meet abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile predictably the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero however their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored she torn by grief guilt and anger he resisting his destiny the postman is costner best work thus far perhaps that alone gives us hope for the future

not too many people know who james whale is but it safe bet that good chunk of them have seen his movies if we are to believe the semi biographical gods and monsters whale would have wanted it to be that way this is an insightful haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in hollywood movie gods and monsters has no interest in being biopic of whale life because it tracks only the final few days of his life and it probably better movie for it it focus is on whale ian mckellen untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone brendan fraser it begins with whale fairly talented artist aside from being director asking boone to sit for him pose for portrait at first boone doesn realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man when he does discover whale sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid lynn redgrave he is frightened refusing to sit for the guy but he comes back only to storm out again disgusted with whale locker room talk boone returns yet another time after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned locker room talk and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening meanwhile jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as result of his stroke not long ago his ailment leads to desperation and depression which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser bravura performance up until seeing this film intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in blast from the past for example was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here this is impressive because his character dialogue is minimal with mckellan doing most of the talking that requires fraser to act through body language difficult skill to master but something he proves capable of doing well this is not to ignore mckellan oscar nominated turn he earned that nomination with his touching performance here although at the risk of sounding like philistine would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination an understated compelling gem whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of battlefield he rejoiced in being free from it only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people in the end perhaps it is what killed him the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form living nightmare 1999 eugene novikov&#137
meteor threat set to blow away all volcanoes twisters summer is here again this season could probably be the most ambitious season this decade with hollywood churning out films like deep impact godzilla the files armageddon the truman show all of which has but one main aim to rock the box office leading the pack this summer is deep impact one of the first few film releases from the spielberg katzenberg geffen dreamworks production company following the rather dismal showing of their previous two releases mousehunt and amistad deep impact shines with elements which could just make it one of the biggest movies of the year deep impact begins with the discovery of an earth bound comet during school astronomy outing by leo beiderman elijah wood which subsequently stirred up the political community of the world keeping the information under wraps to prevent widespread panic president beck morgan freeman took it upon himself and his subordinates to execute highly secretive space project to destroy the comet before it hits earth while pursuing sex scandal story amongst the presidential ranks ambitious up and coming reporter jenny lerner tea leoni unfolds the wool that president beck has pulled over the citizens of the world as if the knowledge of the imminent annihilation of mankind is not enough jenny has to come to terms with her father maximillian schell leaving the mother for younger woman =20 president beck announces the discovery and preparations to destroy the comet exactly one year later with so much confidence that it left no trace of panic within the american community achieving fame from announcement of the comet wolf beiderman en route to earth the name of its discoverers leo beiderman continues life in his small town as young celebrity team of astronauts led by the ageing veteran astronaut spurgeon tanner robert duvall was secretly trained to carry out the mission to land on the comet and create and explosion with nuclear device with the hope of blowing it out of its current path towards earth despite him being the most experienced in the team the younger generation of astronauts in the team doubts tanner ability due to his age but these are just problems of individuals life on earth goes on as any other day confident that the comet will be destroyed when the attempt to avert wolf beiderman path failed and caused the comet to split into two comet wolf and comet beiderman the president unfolds his contingency plan to evacuate part of the population leaving the rest to die citizens are randomly chosen to live underground for years prior to impact when the dust due to the impact around earth have settled by then all life on the surface would have died jenny and leo were picked but many of their loved ones were not only handful of earth population will be saved from destruction =20 deep impact moving moments occur in the least special effect laced scenes while the effects are fantastic they only form small part of the film which indulges itself in the development of its main characters leo lerner and tanner leo struggle when he learns that his girlfriend is not part of the population to be saved lerner dwindling relationship with her father and her pain for the mother loneliness tanner strive to gain the respect he deserves from his crew and his ultimate sacrifice all form the backbone of deep impact moving moments deep impact smells suspiciously like the previous year release contact despite vivid differences think its probably because they both delve in story of global proportions and indulges in the premise of hope faith and life itself both do not depend heavily on eye candy in the form of cgi effects director mimi leder who won numerous awards directing television series and made her debut with peacekeeper last year is definitely director to watch =20 despite this being the first of the two meteor movies this summer the other being armageddon think there will be stark differences in the approach to the subject matter while the premise of both may be the same execution and focus of the films will in fact show that deep impact has more focus on human elements than armageddon which is done by the team which brought us bad boys crimson tide and the rock =20 deep impact should be able to satisfy variety of audiences from the most action craving to those who just want to immerse into its manipulative but nonetheless dramatic premise
there is striking scene early in city of angels where all the angels who live unseen in our midst gather at the beach to watch the sun rise the camera moves above them showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women all garbed in siyah then the camera moves in on the face of seth an angel played by nicolas cage and as the sun rises he smiles and his entire face lights up you see the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets but they cannot feel human touch it is an important scene for several reasons first of all it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible the film presents these fantastic beings as normal looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth watching what goes on with little interference there are none of the standard hokey angel references used in recent films like angels in the outfield 1994 or michael 1996 the angels here are stark and believable this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition for its shows how god angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs or the smell of the salt in the air there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel although there is much beauty in it as well they eternally walk the earth listening to our thoughts touching us in our pain and leading the dying to heaven like human existence being an angel is often confused and unsure city of angels is essentially love story between seth and human beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie meg ryan he first sees her when he is in her operating room waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven maggie is distraught doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table and seth is moved by her efforts and more importantly her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain and seth does what he can with his invisible touch but it not enough he wants to be with her and share her pain not just stand back at distance he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to fall and become human he learns this from another fallen angel played by dennis franz blue in touching and humorous performance sitting at diner together franz tells cage character about how wonderful it is to be human to be able to taste food feel another person skin smell the air and most importantly have loving wife and children of course there is pain to go along with all this but for seth it will be worth it city of angels is something of reinterpretation of wim wender haunting 1988 film wings of desire wenders film was more like poem it was the feeling the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human and unlike most foreign films that are re made into hollywood fare it doesn suffer extensive damage this may be because director brad silberling casper and screenwriter dana stevens blink wanted to make city of angels its own movie inspired by wings of desire but not an attempt to copy it and yet city of angels is not typical hollywood movie it is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale the english patient whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world seale creates many striking visuals in addition to the beach scene there is wonderful sequence in circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by while the film travels along charted plot it takes time to develop its characters and situations it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly and shows just how thin those boundaries are both cage and ryan give soulful soft spoken performances ryan who is usually so bouncy and energetic truly embodies sadness that can only be alleviated by heavenly touch cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple heartfelt gazes and speaks with the comforting knowing voice that only an angel could have what is most striking about city of angels is that stevens has added new ending to the screenplay which is both unexpected and challenging it not formulaic hollywood ending because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time it doesn give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of romance instead it offers something much better something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive ____________________________________________ visit charlie don surf an eclectic collection of film reviews by james kendrick http www bigfoot com ~jimkendrick || mail jimkendrick@bigfoot com
how many of us would become strippers for those of us who wouldn is it moral reason or purely lack of confidence that probably not fair question and for lot of us it could very well be for neither of those reasons as you watch the full monty however you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions would you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough in case you haven guessed the full monty is about stripping but striptease it ain it actually quite charming comedy that uses its ideas with great deal of tact and sophistication it is the story of six out of work out of shape mavi collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless but not without need what to do it hits our main character gaz robert carlyle as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into local male strip club on regular basis it seems that simple take it off and bring in the cash eventually gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance these include the overweight confidence lacking dave mark addy the uptight overly officious gerald tom wilkinson the once suicidal lomper steve huison and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition horse paul barber an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy and guy hugo speer young well endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant when the sextet is complete we re given hefty dose of physical comedy we watch the bumbling middle aged men choreograph pseudo sexy dance numbers all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place as if there anti appeal wasn enough they decide to boost interest in the group by promising the full monty on opening night which for us americans means baring it all and mean all the movie actually ends on opening night hilarious applause worthy ending might add it sure to leave nothing short of big smile on your face as you leave the theater with the subject matter you might not expect the fully monty to be such feel good almost inspiring film but it surprisingly turns out that way the amount of light touching drama also comes as nice surprise never feeling off balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film there lot more to this movie than you might think in other words and the ensemble cast couldn be better each character is completely individual interesting funny and most importantly real the full monty is never offensive very impressive attribute since its subject matter alone could ve easily fallen prey to tastelessness it one of those movies that is best described as solid piece of entertainment perfect for great night on the town or as saturday night movie rental either way you see it it shouldn let you down in the slightest and pun heavily intended when it all said and done you ll be smiling from cheek to cheek

at one point during brian de palma crime epic scarface the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to ranting al pacino and pops question that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves can you stop saying fuck all the time fucking good question that it may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride but as far as can tell oliver stone script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history yet it would be shame if bad language is all de palma scarface is remembered for because this is damn fine gangstar flick the overall structure is similar to howard hawks 1932 original but this time the scene has switched to miami florida and our anti hero chosen vice is cocaine traffiking pacino sporting thick cuban accent gives one the best performances of his career golden globe nominated as tony montana cuban refugee with criminal past who flees castro and comes to america to live the american dream and live it out he does with lashings of violence abuse murder and the funny beyaz powder from his earliest jobs as drug runner for various middlemen tony montana makes it clear to everyone he meets that he not man to be fucked sorry soon he the king of the cocaine heap but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing never do your own stash warns one character early in the film as sure as night follows day the emperor of miami eventually falls writer oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here stone script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development montana is fascinating uneducated but calculating straight shooter who speaks from the heart an ambitious violent man yet one with conscience man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year old sister not wanting her to be sucked into the glitzy dangerous world which he inhabits pacino is dynamite taking to the role with brooding bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no inner life only once does tony express real affection for her and his desire to have children and even then you sense all he really wants is regular screw and beautiful object to show off to his friends and she happy to oblige this isn as meaty role for pfieffer as sharon stone was in casino but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well as director de palma sets up number of dramatic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva the escalating tension he creates in various mob situations drug deal gone wrong an assination attempt is often thrilling and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola where he differs from say coppola godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep whereas in scarface de palma opts for grittier feel and it perfectly suits the material the only major botch is giorgio moroder mostly crap synthesier score it just not right and unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes as expected scarface is very violent at times but you shouldn be watching gangster movies if that upsets you at over two and half hours in length it true epic and if you re fan of the genre you ll love filled minute of it
when you get out of jail you can kill him starring ashley judd tommy lee jones bruce greenwood rated double jeopardy is lurid prepostrous thriller that also one of the year most enjoyable it an uncompromisingly brutal cheerfully anarchic hyperactive actioner that has mission and never diverts from it there is not moment here when the events on screen don have direct bearing on the plot once the film gets going it never stops it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that probably correct assessment of the plot but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davis harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones not even bothering with character introduction director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get go and never finds the brake we meet rather hastily libby and nick parsons ashley judd and bruce greenwood respectively seemingly happy married couple with son matty age they go out on sailboat one night and after period of some rockin sex they go to sleep libby hears strange noise wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood she follows kirmizi trail to the upper deck where she finds knife and out of astonishment picks it up at that convenient moment the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested her lawyer friend puts up defense in court but though we know she is innocent the evidence against her is too compelling her friend adopts her son and she goes to prison once in prison she makes phone call to her friend her friend gives her son the phone nick walks in the room little matty screams daddy the phone goes dead libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn even dead she gets some advice from prisoner former lawyer who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband they can convict her of the same crime again meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they can touch her after weirdly short amount of time she gets out of parole she is sent to live at house with other recent parolees under the command of parole officer travis lehman tommy lee jones she sets out on mission to find her husband and get her son back which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated she winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her son adopter double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime same time same place same circumstances it not like it matters this is rollickingly good thriller intense exciting fast and furious it silly alright but this is the kind of film you just don question in some films plausibility is everything double jeopardy however is not concerned with making sense its sole purpose is to entertain and it does judd helps the film tremendously in difficult role this is her breakout box office performance and she is terrific she brings some emotion to what could have been one dimensional role giving the movie little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive but the movie makes good use of his stone faced wit thankfully too double jeopardy refrains from developing romance between libby and travis subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the film story this is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys and took sort of sick pleasure in that the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book after all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system it great to see movie that doesn so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure double jeopardy is really good but it isn the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards it one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off otherwise your brain will be busy ruining your experience this is thriller that isn concerned with being smart or plausible instead it diverts all attention to the action which this year is second to none
don box with kid gloves don play nice not nice guy and never ever go easy on film consider it to be breech of some sort of code of ethics for movie critic however do some favors and these often come in the form of points that hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery rigormortis the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking gets several of these points each time still however will not go easy on them they recently sent me vhs copy of their down with america trilogy which begins quite wittily with disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film and decided to spend an hour of my day watching it in the famous lines of many martyrs have no regrets well do have some regrets but that is not the point in the previous sentence the point of it was that down with america was film that from critical standpoint did not entirely disappoint me sure the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was pain and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable down with america concerns government agent needless murder and book containing everything from the unabomber manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report like the previous films of rigormortis that have reviewed it displays an off kilter humor and intelligence it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail the best way to see this film would be as parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s dying movement from the day they started these paranoid `thrillers had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word `roswell in down with america the line `roswell is highly absent with an about ten minute running time down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich that the conspiracy films fell into makes jokes at them at the same time and provides us with funny and memorable characters again have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters couldn care less about the film as previously stated concerns federal agent peter roach an obsessed librarian meri stevens mystery man joe kaczkowski and two people obsessed with silence in the library robb sherman kevin flowers the plot book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in public library where it can be viewed by all from there we go into delightful parody the federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth the librarian goes on diatribe about the sanctity of books we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast although the actors and actresses are in small roles and give whole new meaning to `no name it ends up being the no name people who do good job delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out for once don have url that know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online can only say that you should find my previous reviews of auto and les files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself it almost as much fun as the film
plot this movie takes place over one day it rookie cop narcotics training alongside seasoned police veteran the rookie doesn know much about street justice so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the real world how even cops like themselves have to bend the rules and break the law every now and then in order to catch the really bad guys critique pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board some ups some downs and thrilling ending despite couple of small flaws really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations which had me wondering about what would do if were in their place the film gets right into the dirty side of well the dirt on the streets and proceeds to teach the rookie cop and us the audience how things really work down there of course we re receiving this lesson from man who has put away lot of scum in his time but the things he seems to be doing aren exactly on the up and up either and therein lies the fun of the film do you agree that you yourself would need to break few small laws in order to put away the people who break the really big ones well as the film moves along we re given two points of view in respect to this predicament and to me both sides made sense at some point or another and you gotta give lot of credit to the screenplay for that the director who builds the film up wonderfully with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades hawke first off because he rarely plays these commercial roles but does so perfectly here with vulnerable side which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top and denzel well what can you say about mr washington that hasn already been said before he comes through as per his usual high level style here and gives the audience completely different side to his talent of which personally would like to see more he nice he not so nice he smart he not so smart he caring and he dog all the way the few problems that did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point okay we get it you have to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty people move on and this one really major coincidence which involved bathtub that saved the day for one character but seemed little too convenient for my taste also never really understood how washington character got out of certain dire predicament only to be seen driving his car in the very next scene but obviously these small flaws didn taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama film that gets you right into the streets into the nooks and the crannies and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice system and the day to day drug busts see it if you want to wrestle with some of these issues yourself see it if you want to see denzel and ethan strike up palpable chemistry on screen and see it if you like holding on to your seat handles real tight during movie in fact see it for the scene in which ethan hawke plays cards with host of gang bangers alone dang now that intense where joblo coming from the corruptor 10 crimson tide 10 confidential 10 lethal weapon 10 requiem for dream 10 seven 10 10 shaft 10 traffic 10
