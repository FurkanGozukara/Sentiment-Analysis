she was the femme in la femme nikita he was the baldwin in backdraft sliver and fair game with cindy crawford together anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make shattered image the biggest piece of hooey since the stallone stone thriller the specialist the film poses the question what if the life you re living now is really dream and your dreams reality it either about woman who haunted by recurring and recurring and recurring nightmare that she hired assassin or it about hired assassin who haunted by recurring and recurring and recurring nightmare that she honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica it doesn much matter and believe me by the time shattered image runs its painful and pedestrian course you won care these two lives with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with siyah wig siyah emotionless eyes and siyah leather clothing in the seattle based assassin scenes and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is it now twice as boring as it might have been it not that complicated plots can be entertaining of course it helps if you have interesting characters crisp dialogue and modicum of style shattered image isn complex it just stupid and boring parillaud and baldwin who aren exactly shakespearean material to begin with are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines lines like you don beg you insist like that in woman that parillaud character talking to her cat and you re not the reason couldn care less about you huh and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film if you give me couple of minutes you know ll charm the pants off you don have that kind of time talking of pants parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say point of no return we have come to expect this from billy baldwin but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first but there nothing to learn karen is as interesting as cereal box someone out to get me crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone the stranger who sends her flowers maybe even her husband himself is her would be killer siouxsie is the chromium cool tough as nails crack killing machine who shoots out couple of mirrors in order to justify the film meaningless stock title baldwin seems more interested in parillaud nest egg so that he can pave paradise and put up parking lot than he does in her each time graham greene shows up he gets killed barbet schroeder reversal of fortune co produced and should be ashamed of himself every now and again it fun to watch really bad movie and every now and again as shattered image makes agonizingly clear it isn
funny how your expectations can be defeated and not in good ways the ghost and the darkness promised at least it seemed to me to promise hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000 level material an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters get new jobs was one line if remember correctly at the end of the 19th century col patterson val kilmer whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr is an engineer who has been hired to build british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda he is having immensely stereotypical problems the natives are restless his boss is jerk and now two man eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off patterson tries to handle the situation himself incompetently and then turns to charles remington michael douglas hunter of world reknown or something like that the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions they should have gotten top billing and co starred with siegfried and roy they are nigh invulnerable as one comic book put it and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature give me break the movie hasn got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas it just trying to find convenient ways to stall us even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic get this remington big plan is to build large scaffold like structure in the middle of the savannah sit on it and wait for the lion to show up he does this and then gets knocked off by bird by the end of the movie the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand the acting is forgettable douglas does good job of portraying relatively cracked fellow but it nothing he hasn done before kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else somewhere else and the rest vanish into the cinematography the camera by the way sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent what did expect from this movie dunno some real excitement suppose sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation no such luck dug out my tattered copy of hemingway the short happy life of francis macomber and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind
supposedly based on true story in which the british drive to build rail bridge deep in africa grinds to halt after pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898 john patterson val kilmer the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation tried to rid his operation of the lions but fails world renound hunter remington michael douglas is called in and the battle man against lion begins this film has great soundtrack and wonderful scenery the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin we only see one side of each character kilmer is bridge builder and that all we see him as these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesn even appear to be too upset about it and the plot it jaws but with lions again we re presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should it appears to kill men because it just likes too why who knows guess there wouldn be much of story if it didn the problem is that there isn much of story even though it does

mr nice guy is the latest jackie chan film so you should know what to expect weak plot terrible dialogue very little acting ability but some jaw dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile however mr nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie best efforts and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever jackie chan plays who else jackie this time out he famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show not that it ever makes difference in the plot there are only two scenes of him cooking for the rest of the film somehow he mutates into jackie chan supercop it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege tv newswoman diana gabrielle fitzpatrick covertly tapes drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo richard norton and local gang of toughs the demons although she only has one camcorder somehow the result is full of close ups and multiple angles hmmm shades of broadcast news anyway the goons discover diana and will do anything to recover the tape here lies another crucial flaw in the story doesn anyone realize you can copy tape oh well no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense as luck would have it diana runs across jackie and wouldn you know it jackie accidentally ends up with the tape this leads to countless chase and or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie in move apparently designed to woo american and other english speaking audiences the film uses english as its primary language however that doesn mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie recent americanized releases strangely many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english and poorly too whether this is just very bad case of looping an effort to minimize accents or simple case of nostalgia it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie dubbed films the plot in mr nice guy is negligible merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie films it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread look if you have jackie chan playing chef why not use that to your advantage watching jackie doing his stuff in kitchen beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts the action is mixed bag here there really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie films it takes place in the arbitrary location of construction site apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan the action in the film is neither jackie best nor worst but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes the film gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting once or twice it may be useful to highlight spectacular stunt sequence but to slo mo jackie running either this is nod to the six million dollar man or pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down if you ve seen all of jackie films and are in need of another fix go ahead and see mr nice guy however if you re just in the mood for some good action you be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work such as supercop
it was with great anticipation that sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers james horner what was in for was disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 what drags braveheart down is its screenplay it abounds with high production values john toll award winning cinematography which also graced edward zwick 1994 legends of the fall gorgeous score by horner and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names but this does not save misguided script the film wishes to paint its central character as hero but the viewer only response to his heroism is intellectual william wallace producer director mel gibson is fighting for freedom and against tyranny so we have to root for him but wallace actions paint different story he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king wallace speaks of freedom but his acts point toward vengeance after kicking the english out of scotland he decides to invade england this is evident of spartacus complex and this example applies both historically and cinematically the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities the film spartacus like braveheart has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay it is shame that such an excellent score is part of such terrible film horner score tries to make emotional connection but the performances and the script do not help gibson portrays wallace in such way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him this drags down any emotional connection to the film plot and turns three hours into total waste of time
edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back and like his previous two it is working class relationship picture however unlike his previous work the film dwells on more personal story and with female protagonist and in no looking back he stumbles making slow boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work claudia lauren holly is small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life she at turning point in her life and feels as if she going nowhere her boyfriend michael jon bon jovi is broke and in dead end job if she were to marry him she never get chance to escape this town enter charlie edward burns claudia old flame he skipped town several years before without any explanations even for claudia he has come back to town to see her and suddenly she is torn should she stay with stable michael and never escape her hometown or should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again part of the answer lies in the character of her mother blythe danner who fell for the wrong man and has spent her life pining for claudia father to return now it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes at only little past ninety minutes no looking back is rather short for its genre unfortunately it seems much much longer the storyline is simple and uninspired and there lack of energy to the whole proceedings which makes the entire drama rather tedious edward burns makes misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame there no one to restrain his ego which reigns unchecked he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons yeah right lauren holly does what she can with her central character but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions and we never really care bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie his acting talents are much greater than they might seem but he is given mostly bland and ineffective role to work with there not much to recommend in no looking back it not that the film is bad it simply boring there no zest in any aspect of the film and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it
lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode episode is boring empty spectacle that features some nice special effects after the familiar long time ago opening the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo ruled by queen amidala portman jedi knights qui gon neeson and obi wan mcgregor are sent to negotiate deal with the confederation to stop the blockade however this simple blockade is not all it seems and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers including facing the evil darth maul ray park they also meet the future darth vadar anakin skywalker jake lloyd star wars is largely failure in all the major areas of filmmaking script direction and characters the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into two hour epic the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non existent there no underlying tension and no urgent need to see what the outcome is the film also takes leisurely pace in telling the boring story which doesn help there no snap to make the film work it moves at plod the script is boring all the characters speak in morals especially anakins mother there no group spirit evident here and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders it evident that not much is going to happen the two leads are hideously boring static characters given little to do and too much time to do it qui gon and obi wan hold no presence on film and give little for the audience to root for the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul if he had been given more screen time maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history even if he does provide the only straight plot line in the film all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy anakin is annoying and unlikeable instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended it probably not surprising that his hateful little boy unfortunately blessed ani by everyone he knows joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks although in the end none is provided in the film by him although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by pod racer because knew he wouldn be able to talk for while queen amidala is nothing in the film she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must serve her people and go goo goo over anakin again her role will become more important in the later episodes and is given little to do here the actors don help the movie much either liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible mcgregor comes across as posh mothers boy with little charm the casting director must have chose him because he scottish like alec guinness there little other explanation for it natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and poor script but she delivers spunky performance and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in bored voice there very little talent evident with him it hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there he not even very cute the main claim of the film the special effects are okay there nothing impressive about them yet they complement the story well the cgi takes away much of the human element however the battle droids for example the replacement for the stormtroopers are characterless little computer graphics lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers episode is just disappointing it got high production values but little else the music is meandering except near the end the plot gives us no one to root for or even care for the effects are nice but dull the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should there an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair and many clich are catered for throughout the film apart from remotely exciting pod race sequence episode is dry affair that serves little purpose except to make money and to get us to watch episode to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film disappointing is barely the word rating=
from the director of the nightmare before christmas it said in the previews which guessing was said to get people to go see the movie obviously it hasn worked since the $75 million dollar movie has yet to break $5 million to each it own however since monkey bone is not only bad movie all together but technically well made tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects stu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena monkey bone crude comic strip that everyone wants to merchandise they go to great links to get it as well including dollars that let out fart powder when stu and his girlfriend julie bridget fonda are in freak car accident you ll see stu goes into coma and while in his coma stu travels to guessing dark town where all the characters in dreams come to life people are stuck in this town with their nightmares roaming around them when stu spots monkey bone whom he really can stand he tries to keep him under control making new friend kitty rose mcgowan he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death he can go back up and live his life when monkey bone and stu steal pass monkey bone becomes trader and takes it and goes into stu body now monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder so everyone has nightmares or something like that rather complex in fact more than it needs to be monkey bone had potential in the script and even the story what is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes and lack of character development for instance we really don get to know who stu or julie are so why should we even care kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha story behind her but we are not given chance to know her the cast is decent however brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body bridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to screeching halt her performance is bad and she seems miscast dave foley isn given enough to do as well as will grace megan mullally who can be funny the standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being total bust the special effects of monkey bone is what might really bring in some curious viewers these special effects are highly effective and nice to look at with the eyes some of them are believable and some unbelievable for monkey bone he seems to be like stuart little you really don realize that he is animated but on occasion it sneaks up on you the direction by henry selick is good but at times he doesn know what kind of film he wants to make and the ending climax falls off the cliff it too bad really monkey bone could have been real good movie but with it heavily done hack job and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role for those curious however it might be worth the rental but other than that avoid this one
numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci fi suspense thrillers soldier is multi crossbreed between the likes of terminator aliens and offspring the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is real mongrel not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground besides this the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured slow and sluggish and could have done with better choreography russell who is usually good actor in grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character sergeant todd who seems more like sergeant toad besides having almost no dialogue his character appears stunted zombie like which is in line with his screen persona but scores little points of empathy with the audience this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former it is still long way from anything considered desirable
the following review contains spoilers it just the way we are rapist matt frewer responds to supergirl helen slater query as to why she being attacked an example of the mind numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl ll admit it love superman iii know it hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than vehicle for richard pryor but still think it worthy addition to the man of steel franchise supergirl spin off film of sorts from the series same producers alexander and ilya salkind doesn even rival superman iii in terms of quality let alone superman or superman ii supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time as the film begins we see the residents of argo city commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in inner space go about their daily lives ok what so these are exiles from krypton which blew up right were they living there before krypton exploded how do you get to inner space this whole inner space notion is never explained particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world how do they know where superman went how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me argo city is kept running by power source called the omegahedron one day the founder of argo city zaltar peter toole gives the omegahedron to superman cousin kara helen slater for use as inspiration in her art kara uses it to create bug like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of whatever that protects the city in the chaos the omegahedron sails out through the opening dooming the argonians to death in three days time or something kara then climbs into pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to minor league witch named selena faye dunaway who immediately before her dip was ruined announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel peter cook selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans and she sets out to achieve world domination selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth and that she arrived as supergirl complete with appropriate costume supergirl emerges from the bottom of lake when she arrives ok huh why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of lake attention movie explain yourself sorry can only suspend disbelief so much can buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to knowing that she needs secret identity supergirl basically wills herself into school girl outfit complete with different hairstyle picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school she given her dorm assignment and who happens to be her roommate lois lane sister lucy ok coincidence is one thing folks but we re getting really contrived now what follows are some generic all girls school hijinks complete with evil bully girls mean for no reason of course and even shower scene best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks at this point rapidly wondering why bothering with this nonsense there is some credit to give to the film however one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an evil bulldozer destroying small town in search of its prey is very well done also its commendable to see genders reversed in the film whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools hart bochner die hard is particularly fun as kara love interest lovesick landscaper who is under spell cast by selena although he is unfortunately part of one of the film more ridiculous moments when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some menacing bumper cars then there were numerous little things that bothered me the flying effects are never convincing for moment it all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires instead of having her look like she flying the filmmakers wanted her to be graceful so she poses lot and does ballet type maneuvers also who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth pair of truck drivers rapists who immediately attack her and then meet wacky demise there is also some rampant product placement in the film most notably for popeye tylenol and a&w root beer with the latter actually putting its logo on the shirt of one of the rapists finally just one word monsters faye dunaway and peter toole ham it up unmercifully however when toole overacts he entertaining and when dunaway does it she annoying her character actually says the line seize them at one point dunaway henchmen played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro fare much better with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty otis character from the first two superman movies helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent naive character she written to be as she able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable believability aside though it still annoying now despite all this negativity and not alone here supergirl is not well liked nor well respected movie in many circles leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested but excited about its release on dvd they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd to the delight of many people including myself yet still unclear as to why since this movie is so awful the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in theaters the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 35 is enhanced for 16x9 televisions and has been remastered in full thx glory extras on the disc include full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and special project consultant scott michael bosco the excellent 50 minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl the making of feature dig that workout montage trailers tv spots talent bios in depth storyboards accompanied by score from the movie and assorted still galleries the transfer on this international version is incredible you think you were watching new release images are sharp colors jump off the screen and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts only some special effects sequences show the wear of time and there just isn much that can be done about that unless you re obsessive like george lucas the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places however you ll be hearing absurd dialogue and mediocre jerry goldsmith score which is completely unrelated to john williams classic superman theme and sounds better suited for cannon films golan globus production the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there no dead air on the track bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen and we learn great deal more about the film as result of his participation although at times you can tell that bosco is looking for specific response from szwarc and is surprised when he doesn get that response we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track most notably the almost appearance in the film by christopher reeve great detail is given about superman proposed role in the original script before reeve wisely dropped out as it stands superman is written off early on in the film when we hear radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission for the sake of brevity won even get into that one szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds and everyone else agreed that supergirl needed to stand on its own replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy whimsical fantasy nonsense bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been hit at the box office again for the sake of brevity won even get into that one anchor bay has also released limited edition only 50 000 copies pressed two disc set disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release disc two features the never before seen director cut of the film which runs 138 minutes long the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don add much of note except for few moments which lengthen peter toole screen time particularly during his latter appearances the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono but fans of the film won care one question though shouldn the director commentary be on the director cut of the film never seen supergirl before sat down to watch this dvd was nine when it was released to theaters and even then was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it so when popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair had no idea what to expect knew the film wasn beloved and never had any interest in it before but was willing to give it shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc as the disc began to spin was rather impressed with the opening sequence which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo so slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started at the end of the film supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron and flies back to argo city ugh give up surprised even made it to the end of the film not once not twice but three times to review these discs supergirl is definitely terrific dvd package but very lousy movie [pg]
the sequel to the fugitive 1993 marshals is an average thriller using it association with the fugitive just so it can make few extra bucks tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive this time he after fugitive mark sheridan snipes who the police think killed two fbi agents but of course he been set up and when the police plane escort he and gerard are riding crashes he makes run for it gerard not so hot on his tail what follows is about hours of action brought to us by the director of executive decision 1995 another film curiously involving plane when comparing this movie to the fugitive the prequel is far superior but even on it own marshals is pretty lousy movie while the original was reasonably intelligent and had fugitive to root for the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film overlong running time while the fugitive gave little time to develop harrison fords character marshals is straight in there pulling it trump card the place crash almost immediately to be honest couldn care less if snipe character got captured or not snipes performance is average and his character gets surprisingly little screen time considering he is the fugitive for reasons ll explain later tommy lee jones is as fine as ever although his role is hardly challenge the sense of deja vu was overwhelming know it the same role from the fugitive but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film there few nudge nudge references from the first film but apart from that nothing nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who roped into the chase and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife nobody looks as if their having good time and all the performers are on autopilot the supporting cast are but when it comes to performances marshals falls flat on it face it doesn fare any better plot wise either the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes but then veers off into terrorists territory as said above the film is an normal average terrorist thriller seen million times before but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional if this film wasn the sequel to the fugitive this would probably go straight to video or not even been made at all because it so average and because of the film plot changing it course snipes is almost forgotten apart and hardly features in the movie stuart baird the director is all right but there no particular scene that stands out it director is the usual action movie style even the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension the special effects are nice especially the plane crash and there good if very loud soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith but in the end marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement sure it loud and dumb but in the end marshals just ain fun bored performers and lackluster plot and script do not make good action movie overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities
apparantly money talks and uses quite bit of obscenities doing so ve always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity film can possess whether in language violence sex or what have you find that this fact gives me little more leverage to complain when movie goes overboard and money talks definitely does it not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly and mean constantly but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged perhaps if one character were foul mouthed but in this film everybody swears nearly every other word money talks is about siyah ticket scalper named franklin hatchett played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker franklin is your typical con man and ends up with more than one person out to get him when the plot finally gets underway there no less than three people or groups that want him dead or alive the frenchman who somewhat responsible for franklin escape from prisoner packed bus hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder franklin only hope james russell charlie sheen an investigative reporter for the local news who out to prove himself worthy journalist james offers to help clear franklin name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week both of these elements are completely lost along the way however and never do reappear as expected the odd couple of franklin and james do wind up friends at the end which is another wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of becoming friends at any point along the way there is just nothing original or intriguing about this film and so many developments are either non relevant or just plain forgotten about money talks is paint by numbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience frivilous dialogue predictable flat storyline and two dimensional characters make money talks reason to save your money
starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public particularly kids wanted to see therefore it with some surprise that as big fan of the above mentioned movies was so disappointed with pocahontas despite some innovation and risk taking the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes as are its characters group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of altin with no regard for the savages that live there the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent terrible clash the ending as it turns out is not entirely happy one and is one of the film finer moments the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth governor ratcliffe for instance is snobbish single minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses captain john smith is blond hunk who while slightly misguided is good at heart pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time she even comes complete with insignificant best friend again against tradition talking animals aren used but lusty wizened talking tree is this is an odd compromise but it one of the few elements that really work the animals are delight and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to rather bland presentation maybe it would have been better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes the talking tree who seems to have thing for john smith is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch the music welcome delight in the later disney films is mostly let down here with the exception of the catchy and motivational colors of the wind mel gibson as the voice of john smith has solid singing voice and should have been used more the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character was rather bored through what turned out to be shorter than expected running time even the children in the audience seemed restless while there no stopping kid from seeing something that they want or disney wants them to most believe will be disappointed perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history it all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit movie entertainment value but doing so to historical facts doesn work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer minds and plot holes that are never filled even the artwork another disney strong point varies greatly in quality making any story problems even more obvious as mentioned above there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film for instance if john smith was truly such world traveler and had so much experience with savages why did he so quickly change his previous kill as many indians as can attitude if he was such nice guy after all he should have changed his ways long before this or how about pocahontas amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen beyaz men can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience but simply saying that they had met missionary years earlier would have cleared up lot history was modified in the film anyway as it is wonder if it doesn give kids the wrong impression in short the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions they end up failing on too many levels
seen may 1998 at 40 at the crossgates cinema 18 theater #13 with chris wessell and sean shea for $5 [theater rating very good sound picture and seats] the big budget mega hype event movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming weekly routine instead of seasonal one gluttony is hollywood favorite sin but it is the movie goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever worsening basis lost in space is the latest such offering film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre it made up of every element of science fiction but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for audiences attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films this one opens with fast paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film probably because it has star wars written all over it but as the producers way of showing off their budget through the special effects battle scenes are worthless without tension and since we have no idea what the setting is it impossible to care about anything that happens in essence the entire segment works like teaser for an arcade game not piece of filmmaking we meet the robinson family family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources each member of the family has special trait and personality and yet none of them seem like actual people professor john robinson hurt is the intelligent quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it it obvious what role this aspect will play of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other while the necessary problems are resolved at the right moments the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it presented in completely serious manner without trace of satire and is so pathetic it laughable the first act is not building of story but juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements such as plot conflict and characterization god forbid we re provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent in fact it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non existent yes the characters do speak but they do not talk they say things that only relate to the conflict but they never really interact unless it the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west leblanc and uptight unemotional judy robinson graham it amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens eventually the pacing rapidly increases but the amount of genuine interest does not the story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr smith oldman the cartoony villain and his plans for sabotage what ensues is series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as alien lite the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive but there never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly plotlines are developed but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes but it presented in such ridiculous way it utterly boring by the time the last act rolls around there is no sense of payoff building the ending does not go out on high note with any kind of climax instead it seems to come to sudden halt but at least it ends at all lost in space is major film production at its worst it frightening that film so poorly written directed and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment
this is your definitive hollywood movie extremely predictable following the basic formula horrible ending overzealous writing meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise ass character of which we ve seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly wasn used enough here afraid the film would have been completely unbearable in this film ashley judd plays women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for weekend while in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her over money how original while in jail she works out exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition now she has learned about law titled double jeopardy stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works now her po parole officer and bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims skipping over to the acting the fact that judd is more of looker than an actress no offense she has been good [simon birch] and even very good to great [kiss the girls] at times in the past and believe may have the potential to be better but she terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying doesn really add to the movie at all just takes away as said jones was fine although he did not have much to work with he was much more of supporting character which is fine and he handled it well especially considering the material he had to work with feel this film had alot going for it originality not being an issue the acting was the only thing as said keeping it alive the plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better the action scenes were well made however sometimes out of place was just left unsatisfied in the long run so basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely over thought the plot has certainly been done before generally speaking the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot and is basically film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones who if he had some more screentime could perhaps have earned the film higher rating in my book anyway keep this in mind if you re in the mood for good action film rent the fugitive d+
in twilight ex alcoholic ex cop ex husband ex private eye harry ross paul newman works for pair of aging hollywood actors catherine susan sarandon and jack ames gene hackman jack is being blackmailed and he asks harry to deliver the payoff instead of the blackmailers harry finds dying ex cop emmet walsh as more bodies begin to pile up harry realizes that he will have to solve the disappearance of catherine first husband twenty years earlier to find out who willing to kill to keep that secret buried newman sarandon hackman with an list cast of oscar laureates like that twilight would seem very promising however the script is tired and predictable it would serve well as tv movie of the week possibly with some 1970 detective hero reprising his role the appeal of the project for its stars and its director robert benton is nostalgia twilight wants very much to be 1940 film noir with alan ladd or dick powell all of the standard tropes are here hard boiled among the rich and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets femme fatale who tempts and confounds the hero shadowy figures shooting from doorways dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation the script offers little originality and co authors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is clich in 1998 elmer bernstein score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn note for note from vintage noir the lead actors try hard none of the three has every made less than full effort even when burdened with bad script they try to invest every line and gesture with meaning and they create convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters harry is fond of jack but is in love with catherine jack is dying of cancer and is jealous of harry love for catherine catherine teases harry and enjoys his attention but her real feelings are hidden beneath carefully maintained veneer twilight wants to be character driven like nobody fool also directed by benton also starring newman based on novel by russo was but the tired script gives the actors too little to work with twilight also squanders fine supporting cast stockard channing harry friend on the police force reese witherspoon jack catherine bratty kid giancarlo esposito the humorous sidekick john spencer harry nemesis on the force liev schreiber and margo martindale the blackmailers and james garner cop who bailed movie stars out of trouble
there was probably good reason that the warner bros studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened and after seeing this piece of toxic waste now know why this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago fire down below centers its story on little mining town in god country somewhere in eastern kentucky it beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate kris kristopherson who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role it turns out that he filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for tidy profit seagal plays jack taggert an aikido versed fighting machine who is an agent with the epa no not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa it the environmental protection agency had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice written by someone named jeb could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships banjo picking preachers and dumb as nails rednecks but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in seagal idea of disguise is long length $1000 leather jacket but to get closer to the kinfolk he will fix people porches for free that another great epa asset teaching agents how to fix porches slow and plodding this project is total mess the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige here his bravado basically turns into bullyness townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever and his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of sunday church ceremony gets behind the pulpit and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping kristopherson meets up with seagal kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away seagal gallantly replies ll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and show of fireworks in the background this is truly nothing more than pompous showcase for seagal righteousness and narcissistic arrogance seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring new genre into the filmplace that of the enviro thriller on deadly ground however the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this still believe in preserving mother earth so save your $5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity
tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers all searching for deeper meaning however they won find much meaning in the real blonde and not enough real humor either joe matthew modine is struggling actor or he claims to be one even though he has no credits under his belt his girlfriend mary catherine keener has no pretensions about her career she makeup artist working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair marlo thomas and supermodel of the month sahara bridgette wilson sahara who has acquired new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid has an on again off again relationship with joe best friend bob maxwell caulfield however bob has gotten his biggest break yet starring role on soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly daryl hannah who may be that illusive woman he always pursued real blonde there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde but not enough the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background such as sahara perfume ads depression it not just state of mind but to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in barrel and unfortunately the film forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic take for example the film framing device of an old lady and her dog the story serves absolutely no purpose makes little sense and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film but they re stuck in the most boring plotlines modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley who appears as another struggling actor keener character has stronger edge but the insult self defense class taught by denis leary no less she is stuck in makes little sense the movie running time is under two hours but it seems like it is well over it there just not enough humor to speed things along and not enough meaning to propel any drama
gordy is not movie it is 90 minute long sesame street skit and very bad one at that this movie is so stupid and dumb that it depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light and even more surprising is the fact that this is disney movie sure children are the target audience of this movie but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it it is the story of farm piglet named gordy voiced by garms whose family has been taken away to up north which we know means death of course we can hear the animals talk to each other and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible actually it almost funny in way the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears little girl named jinnie sue macallister young who sees gordy on the back of truck and essentially steals him jinnie is country singer and the film goes off on huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it what is the point of this maybe she is one of the producer relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something we then cut to huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce roescher who is sad because his divorced mother is dating he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue but he accidentally falls in pool probably because he was sitting on the diving board with $200 suit on nah didn see that one coming starts to drown and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him if this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of food processing corporation when hank grandfather the original ceo dies and leaves his fortune to hank and gordy of course there must be villain but even this villain donadio as sipes isn that evil he never raises his voice or becomes angry and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story it hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is family film or if the filmmaker are just this untalented and stupid at times gordy is tolerable to watch thus earning it one star and not the dreaded but it just so unbelievably boring cliche dumb unfunny corny and just plain bad it may scare children it certainly disturbed me 21 96 29 97 13 97 [see also babe
senseless marlon wayans is very talented physical comedian and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life alas moments are simply that moments which are not enough to lift this fantasy comedy above its one joke premise granted that one joke is initially amusing when wayans darryl witherspoon an economics major at stratford university hits some dire financial straits he becomes guinea pig for experimental drug that heightens all five senses after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land position at highly esteemed corporate firm at this point the film sounds more like senseful than senseless but through some turns of the plot darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once essentially leaving him yes senseless this sets up some showcase moments for wayans gift for physical comedy especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely hilariously limp but these gags and the gag behind the entire movie quickly grows stale once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses instead of exploring any new comic territory director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness wayans approaches each go round with gusto but by this point he simply treading water for the rest of the film unfunny duration senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn strive to be anything more than comic trifle however the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in blanket of bogus sincerity darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash strapped family and this serious angle seems to come from an entirely different movie unlike wayans last starring vehicle the surprisingly effective and serious the 6th man the emotional content of senseless is forced and unconvincing any attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles darryl romance with janice tamara taylor young woman who yearns for man who is true to himself does not generate sparks of any kind once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros comes to an end the genuinely funny marlon wayans has promising big screen future ahead of him but if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless his film career could go the way of his once promising older brother damon who is now set to make his comeback on television
synopsis when meteorite crashlands in the arizona desert community college professors ira kane duchovny and harry block jones are first on the scene they discover that an alien lifeform has arisen from the rock and is evolving at an amazing rate soon the army advised by dr allison reed moore moves in and forces kane and block out but when the aliens begin to menace society it may take the scientists combined efforts to stop them before they terminate the evolution of another lifeform humanity review evolution certainly has the ingredients for decent comedy it directed by reitman clearly trying to parlay his ghostbusters success into twenty first century counterpart it stars duchovny and although one might question his judgment in lampooning his files character so soon after leaving the tv series it should certainly provide him with plenty of ammunition and then there moore who may not have much prior experience in comedy but who has certainly proven her ability as an actress shame then that it all deteriorates into such hopelessly unfunny morass evolution is movie more concerned with its special effects which are quite good than anything resembling consistently funny script it has its moments scene in which jones body is invaded by an alien is particularly entertaining but there are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour moore is totally wasted her clumsy shtick getting very old very fast duchovny has stunningly little in the way of material to work with and the story is so formulaic it could have been written by monkeys part of what made ghostbusters so wonderful was combination of great script and characters the audience could root for evolution is so mind numbingly tedious that it difficult not to start cheering for the aliens
mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival it may not be clear to the viewer why am so negative on this film for most of the running time in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry toward the end of the film think everything that has been built falls apart the film was to be pilot for tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it something else is what he did the film opens with woman played by laura harring about to be killed in car when car crash saves her life she crawls away from the accident with concussion and finds herself bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep meanwhile young vivacious betty naomi watts arrives in hollywood from canada she wants to build career as an actress betty is little surprised to find woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow she does not know who the woman is she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is they fix on name rita for her but are not sure if this right or not meanwhile local director adam kesher justin theroux has problems of his own he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else cammie rhodes melissa george these two threads are joined by third one in which there is strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong there is also strange character called the cowboy monty montgomery adding to the confusion in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits lot of mulholland drive starts out fun lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film he just chooses not to as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason there are no earthworms but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches the film is little long for the subject matter toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes clearly not intended for the tv pilot unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers will not mention them in the main body of the review but give mulholland drive on the to 10 scale and low on the to +4 scale mulholland drive spoiler warning have rated this film fairly low you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film david lynch is in large part dark satirist most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside in mulholland drive think he is having laugh at the expense of the crime film genre what he does with this film is are you sure you want to read this playing off the audience expectations that there will be simple explanation for what is going on the first 80% of the film he tells simple multi thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something the audience expectation is that they will add up but he has given clues that are self contradictory lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories in fact the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until hear better explanation think lynch is merely playing joke there is visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties mad magazine called it poiuyt other sources called it tri pronged bar look at small portions of it and makes sense look at the whole figure and it does not this film is in my estimation the cinematic equivalent of tri pronged bar
young einstein is embarrassingly lame but that didn stop it from becoming phenomenon in australia where it became the third largest box office hit of all time in the warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan inxs and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under personally hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein box office bomb young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious who not only wrote produced edited and directed the film but also starred and did his own stunts his creation is about as stupid and contrived as you expect from someone named yahoo the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein youth whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania remote australian island in addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity albert invents surfing bubbles in beer and the electric guitar yahoo plays einstein as naive and unrefined country hick clown with an insatiable curiosity although yahoo performance is at first endearing the one dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say e=mc2 yahoo has created charming family for albert and the scenes on tasmania are often clever but after the first twenty minutes the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into poor excuse for comedy young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack unfortunately the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing almost every other scene includes blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching movie or music video the instrumental score on the other hand is generally playful yahoo uses such classics as the 1812 overture and the theme from the good the bad and the ugly to great comic effect halfway through young einstein knew for sure the movie was stinker but it wasn until the very end that finally put my finger on why the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies such as young sherlock holmes but from cheesy prime time sitcoms in fact young einstein might have been more at home on network television where its sophomoric humor wouldn raise any eyebrows
capsule not as bad sequel as crow or batman robin but still horribly putrid cheesy and ill conceived this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons extended review you know about halfway through this movie realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes you have damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy hong kong style martial arts beautifully choreographed by robin shou who also plays liu kang the fight scenes are both mind blowing and graceful acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep this is what made the original so fun but unfortunately for the sequel we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson instead they got john leonetti the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat not good choice while the fight scenes are brutal and eye popping the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare the acting is sub par which could endure if it were not for the director style the special effects the treatment of the story and characters mr leonetti should go back to lighting in my opinion could say dozens of bad things about him he way overuses slow motion he has no eye for action he can get even mediocre performances out of actors and so on but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping apparantly everybody can now fly hell all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot but not when it happens every few minutes and is done so poorly better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena warrior princess in short they should have gotten paul anderson back or at least let robin shou direct unlike the first one whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic mk special effects are bland fake looking and overall just plain bad counted at least half dozen times that blue screening was painfully obvious had this movie been made in the 80 it would have been ground breaking but in today industry it doesn even look finished now for the _really_ bad parts admit an avid fan of the mortal kombat series the games are amusing diversions an easy way to work off stress and anger the first movie was mindlessly fun thrillride this could have been really cool movie it isn the writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers some of the plot elements are just plain stupid how stupid take for instance how our heroes move around they use giants spheres the roll around underground supposedly at thousands of miles per hour oh boy even worse is the treatment of secondary characters blink and you ll miss em most characters had more depth in the video games if you thought batman robin was bad about this you ain seen nothin yet good 75% of the characters are introduced kick somebody around bit then either die or are forgotten about there no explanation at all for this and for the final blasphemy the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie lasted about minutes and then just sort of ended it almost made me weep to sum it all up rent it on video and fast forward through everything except the fight scenes
libby parsons ashley judd has the perfect little life rich husband cute son and house on the ocean but when her husband nick bruce greenwood takes her sailing she awakes to find him gone and her hands covered with blood just as she makes it to the deck and picks up the bloody knife lying there the coast guard arrives in response to distress call her vanished husband sent she convicted of his murder of course and leaves her son matty benjamin weir with her best friend annabeth gish time passes and the friend disappears with matty during their last phone conversation libby hears matty yell daddy and realizes that her husband is still alive libby serves six years growing harder and driven by the desire to kill nick based on the theory that because of the double jeopardy amendment she can off him with impunity when she gets parole she sent to halfway house run by travis lehman tommy lee jones former law professor who ruined his life with drunk driving accident after little breaking and entering and some destruction of property libby jumps parole and lams it across the country looking for nick and matty travis pursues naturally double jeopardy is watered down version of the fugitive with jones sleep walking through his well worn pursuer persona although libby never leaps from bus that collides with train she manages to get into few nail biters chased down the beach by jeep chained to car that plunges into the ocean sealed in coffin that add some much needed thrills to an anemic slow moving script character development is thin travis intriguing backstory is mentioned couple times but has no effect on the story think they only made him former law professor so that he could verify the double jeopardy theory when libby gets the drop on nick it long way to go for one line there considerable sexual tension between travis and libby hey there something the fugitive didn have but it never goes anywhere libby is tv movie everywoman but judd intense performance draws us in and makes us forget that her character has no distinguishing characteristics this is judd most prominent role to date and she proves that she can light up the screen let hope hollywood gives her more to work with next time around the quality of director bruce beresford movies seems to depend on luck when he has good script and strong cast he turns out oscar caliber work like breaker morant driving miss daisy and tender mercies when he doesn we get double jeopardy screenwriters david weisberg and douglas cook previously collaborated on the rock script which probably benefited from the numerous uncredited rewrites bottom line ashley judd tries hard but can save this predictable bore
american pie alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summer attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute couple ness and zany comedy it about an a+ student biggs as paul who gets scholarship to some college in new york city who sticks out like sore thumb and falls for dora suvari ditzy heroin chic goth chick who has no ambition or self respect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed around just like hick boy paul is so we ve got fish out water formula mixed with meet cute romantic comedy which ideally should make for good movie unfortunately the atrocious screenplay and boring direction by clueless auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to screw up everything about the film these characters are totally unrealistic and unbelievable it as if everyone under age 30 is stoned raver there no background or details to anyone or anything it just bunch of cartoon characters running into each other not to mention the story itself which is virtually non existant and contains so many plotholes it like swiss cheese even the basic editing is bad if you re looking for romantic comedy stay far away from this one because it is neither romantic nor funny saw this in packed cinema on opening night and the audience barely laughed at all if you ve seen the commericials you ve seen all the funny parts which are all from the first five minutes
synopsis an aging master art thief his supplier and young buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be or are they in this convoluted mess involving risky heist during the millennium comments this movie was boring plain and simple entrapment should not have been boring it stars sean connery who can still carry an action film despite his age catherine zeta jones likeable enough film presence and ving rhames ultra cool star of pulp fiction and mission impossible it takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears current hot topic in the news in its storyline which is set at the end of 1999 it has some genuinely well staged action sequences so what went wrong plenty unfortunately the major problem with entrapment is its script it has been there done that feel to it nothing seems particularly inventive or original so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags it runs nearly two hours the screenwriters for example periodically use countdown to the millennium as means of transition between scenes days to the millennium this device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci fi film strange days the characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth surprise revelation is made entrapment in other words relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character true motive is resulting in convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion the star power here is quite strong but the viewer can help but feel the actors are wasted in this production sean connery is given such mind numbing lines as never trust naked woman ving rhames character seems like an afterthought he not developed at all the camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zeta jones tight wardrobe this in and of itself is not bad but after while it has juvenile feel to it at least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that they re exploiting the female body entrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot development sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her in tights arc and pivot around laser beams the tagline for this movie reads the trap is set it sure is on those who spent money to see this movie entrapment really isn that bad it is watchable would suggest however one waits until this is on cable or television to see it
by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer it possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending which is an insulting cop out somewhere out there maybe there small cadre of film goers who will appreciate sphere dubious charms but not among them sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by it hard to understand why the rights were optioned sphere is the kind of first class mess that only top line director with an list cast can create with expectations high and how could they not be considering that another barry levinson dustin hoffman collaboration the excellent wag the dog is still playing in theaters something this bad can help but look even worse the last time big name big budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year batman robin and everyone knows how that movie was received sphere starts out little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron the abyss but somewhere along the way it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort event horizon science and philosophy which are used to good effect during sphere first hour give way to mindless confusing action sequences attempts at characterization fall apart intelligent writing which is evident early on is replaced by hackneyed drivel special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness but all that is just in preparation for the ending which is inexcusably awful this is the time honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film there is some promise but it all in the setup we re introduced to norman goodman dustin hoffman psychologist who once wrote $35 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that crashed space ship is discovered when one is found in the middle of nowhere 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee on the team with him are beth halperin sharon stone biochemist who was once his student and lover harry adams samuel jackson mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ted fielding liev schreiber an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology and harold barnes peter coyote the government operative in charge of the mission together the five descend into the bowels of the ocean where they rendezvous with temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact for while sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man meets alien situation the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship apparently from the future offer intriguing possibilities then right around the one hour mark that the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever left of titanic the virtually non stop action begins and once it starts the script becomes superfluous this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension but instead he relies on loud overbearing music strange camera angles and quick cuts to make things exciting additionally because none of the characters are well formed common failing in anything penned by crichton who more interested in technology than people viewers don develop much of rooting interest it makes sitting through sphere frustrating and pointless experience what about that list cast not surprisingly the most energetic performance is given by samuel jackson but his harry isn person he walking plot device spouting occasionally witty dialogue dustin hoffman isn lively or particularly good it ironic that this which may be his worst work in decade has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination for wag the dog sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion automatons would have been as effective then there queen latifa who despite getting fifth billing in the credits ahead of liev schreiber who boasts at least quadruple her screen time has less than handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count like to think that levinson and hoffman recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be chose to make wag the dog as sort of penance the low budget picture was filmed during sphere lengthy pre production phase if that the case forgiveness is granted less inclined to look favorably upon crichton although he has few enjoyable titles on his resume jurassic park and the levinson directed disclosure come to mind even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process crichton credit as producer disallows him absolution he was willing participant in creative travesty no wonder sphere is being released in february in the midst of the early year cinematic wasteland it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic which should plow sphere under on its way to ninth consecutive weekend atop the box office heap

susan granger review of mulholland drive universal focus whatever david lynch is selling not buying from the writer director of mavi velvet and twin peaks comes another dark mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills dazed beautiful brunette laura elena harring emerges and stumbles down hill slipping unobserved into 30s style apartment as the tenant leaves for trip the next morning dewy blonde naomi watts from deep river ontario arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase her aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust meanwhile hotshot director justin theroux whose wife is in bed with the poolman is forced to cast certain actress in his new film and there an assassin mark pellegrino roaming the city the tortuous paths of these various characters and others named cookie coco and cowboy intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because midway through the story lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality leaving huge wad of cash mavi metallic key paralyzed mogul and lot of questions that go unanswered elena harring and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses effectively making the subtle switch the same cannot be said for former dancer ann miller who stiff and self conscious speaking like most lynch players in staccato tones on the granger movie gauge of to 10 mulholland drive is frenzied frustrating originally designed as an episodic tv pilot this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substance is packaged as puzzle with several of the key pieces left out
read the new yorker magazine and enjoy some of their really in depth articles about some incident they will take some incident like the investigation of mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail it becomes real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested and what kind of pressure the investigators are under and just about any other aspect you can think of frequently get the feeling that the article sounded exciting but am being told in more detail than really wanted to know often get to the middle of story and say ok it sounded good but now have invested more time than am willing to spend on this subject film is different medium it is visual medium that slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize frequently am surprised to find out how short film script is and how much of the pages are empty space the magazine article and the film script are two very different media the insider is film adaptation of the vanity fair article the man who knew too much by marie brenner it is too much an adaptation of magazine article slowed to the pace of film it really verges on being tedious at least at times for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused host of unhealthy side effects but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco the tide turned when former vice president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking the resulting pressure to stop the story created small civil war at cbs who were the major people involved what were their motives how was the story almost killed how did it get aired anyway that is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider this all could have been enthralling but it is not the sort of thing that stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well and in the end he failed to make long story short the film needed director who knew how to make long story short the film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview terrorist we get taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace played by christopher plummer there the news team under producer lowell bergman al pacino are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists we have wry irony on who really has clout in the world terrorists can grab the headlines but the tobacco companies have the real position of power incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand russell crowe dejectedly returning from work to his home we discover that he has been fired and his career brought to complete halt unexpectedly he had been very profitably rewarded vice president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family rather than support him his wife liane diane venora demands of him what are they supposed to do for income meanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand they offer wigand $12 000 just to interpret the data wigand severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms he is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman in spite of the secrecy wigand former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role and so the game begins wigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer meanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family the film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants wigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out he and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost legal fight al pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider the story is told slowly and in just bit too much meticulous detail the film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience the musical score by pieter bourke lisa gerrard and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory it puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling also disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace plummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly this film might have been really engaging experience under another director control michael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style rate it on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale
you should have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following the odd couple ii sneak preview they were as happy group of men as ve ever encountered what great movie exclaimed one gent at the urinal everything was so true yeah laughed man standing next to him drive as slow as that one guy did my kids give me holy hell for it and peeing is big part of my day just like with felix chuckled another fellow as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples and prepared to rejoin his wife if you re over 60 and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour below the posted speed limit neil simon the odd couple ii may be just the film for you others will likely be less charitable while the odd couple ii is amiable enough neil simon shockingly lazy screenplay feels like slapped together tv reunion show suffering from wheezing situation comedy set ups and jokes straight out of the borscht belt simon once the toast of broadway has apparently shifted his sights from the great beyaz way to the neighborhood multiplex in branson missouri the contrived story involving the marriage of their kids provides the excuse for reunion between oscar madison and felix unger who haven seen each other in 17 years the former roommates fly into california from their respective homes for the wedding and quite literally run into one another at the airport they take off in rental car for the ceremony in san molina get lost and have series of wacky adventures on the road jack lemmon and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak and oscar the slob while there is an undeniable chemistry between the pair the impact of their reunion is lessened by the fact that they ve headlined three films together since 1993 grumpy old men grumpier old men and out to sea still the two veteran actors are fun to watch matthau whose magnificently rumpled face looks like big pile of laundry with eyes has field day as oscar the crown prince of the curmudgeons lemmon looking pastier than usual is fine as the ever annoying felix who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional allergic honks of phnah phnah despite their bickering the characters have real affection for each other providing welcome respite from the non stop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films together unfortunately matthau and lemmon charm isn enough to compensate for simon hack script which wouldn pass muster even on upn sitcom one contrived situation follows another lathered with enough stale one liners to supply dozen would be comics on open mike night at the local comedy club if someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as was try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements burger king gets one as does the el pollo loco taco joint but budget rent car really hits the jackpot between script references to their business and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name couldn keep count of all the plugs did however keep track of some of the swearing came up with four god damns three shitheads and two fucks the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for film aimed at an older audience but the theater full of seniors appeared to have no problem with them howling like crazy every time the boys let rip with naughty word it sad that writer of neil simon stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise one running gag involves oscar and felix inability to remember the name of the town where the wedding is to be held at one point the men actually spend 30 seconds just free associating riffing off variants of the word san the sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simply embarrassing one of the oldest maxims of film going is beware of movies that use the author name in the title neil simon the odd couple ii is no exception to the rule while the production has enough minor pleasures to warrant tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon it has no business playing in movie theater of course there bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree with every word ve written and would probably whip my young whippersnapper ass to boot one thing for sure though they ll never catch me in car chase
if there were subject just screaming to be made into film it was studio 54 the late steve rubell infamous new york discotheque which came to symbolize the taboo smashing excesses of the disco era heyday easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone all set to thumping dance beat so when miramax started production on _54_ last year the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began an edgy film as down and dirty as the club itself written and directed by promising first timer mark christopher and starring some hot young talent salma hayek neve campbell newcomer ryan phillippe and mike myers in his dramatic debut my how easily does the worm turn hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th hour reshoots wrapped only month ago rash of studio imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew especially christopher unhappy and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics at the last minute though miramax did decide to screen the film so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers last name was misspelled on the invitation not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes for media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed myself included and with good reason somehow some way the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism boring although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_ lifelessness _54_ focuses for the most part on tight knit trio of employees at the club coat check girl aspiring disco diva anita wasted hayek her busboy husband greg breckin meyer and most prominently the fresh from jersey shane shea phillippe who enjoys quick rise from busboy to head bartender these characters are about as generic as those descriptions in focusing on the hired help christopher really missed the boat with the exception of the flamboyant always woozy rubell myers in well modulated turn the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers but those of the people who went there to party not necessarily the numerous vip guests but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club famously hard ass doormen and dance among other things the night away with the rich famous and infamous the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow feisty dottie disco and drug crazed granny but she peripheral character at best as such aside from the expected overhead crowd shots there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ what is disco film especially one about the pinnacle of the movement without the dancing even whit stillman _the_last_days_of_disco_ which wasn so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within group of hip to only themselves club hopping preppies featured at least one extended dance scene dancing isn the only thing glazed over in _54_ so is the sex but that may not be entirely christopher fault from what ve heard his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring starting with the shane character he was conceived and actually filmed as wild morally ambiguous bisexual which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54 legend but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out consequently so was the film aside from brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film shane fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie sela ward and an abbreviated bedhopping montage the sexual dimension is just about ignored shane in this incarnation is sanitized to the point of blandness an idealistic do gooder who pines for frequent guest at the club julie siyah campbell worldly soap star with yes heart of altin this tacked on romance would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience they fail on both counts ultimately _54_ failure comes down to three letters as in there isn any to be had for the audience too much time is spent with the boring shane and too little is spent on the club floor where all the action took place anyhow though whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club it should be euphoric height for her the crowd and the audience however the moment doesn get chance to reach that level for it is cut short by moment of forced sentimentality which also mars the film conclusion one of the last minute reshoots strangely upbeat and wistful the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there two of them in fact but _54_ is not one of them they re on cable tv couple of documentaries produced by and vh1 these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings on within it show that there still great disco movie to be made the problem is after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ the subject may have run its hollywood course
the premise of turbulence is sure very familiar to us all we ve seen it before in passenger 57 executive decision and countless other flicks that are good in there own way you know terrorists take over plane ask the police on the ground for what they what and so on turbulence starts out with convict ray liotta being accused of crime you think there is no way he could have done it he so open and kind he is taken in and is subsequently transported on commerical plane to la this is already problem there is no way that convicts would be transported on the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on anyway it is christmas eve and everyone is waiting to get to la and spend christmas eve there well convict one manages to stop the flight in its proverbial tracks and liotta still as calm as ever takes the other convict out he also has eyes for lauren holly flight attendent and seems to grow closer to her the plot stops here didn like this movie because it seemed to be rip off of every other airplane movie ve ever seen at one point mr liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in the shining serious it was like they stole for every other movie down to the only reason did not give this stars is because it had some okay stunts don even bother
this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont debut as director 1994 surprise hit speed but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead annie sandra bullock is in the wrong place at the wrong time again she going on cruise with her new boy friend alex jason patric and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger willem dafoe who has bone to pick with the shipping line they sacked him after he got sick now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship safe for compensation that actually is the whole storyline speed could do without dialogues the movie is all about images and remarkable sound don really know why this is called an action movie except for few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies first we are introduced to number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie then desaster strikes sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around looked for the action but couldn find it most of the time she is part of the decoration the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have shot at defusing bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind fire door now we know that she can handle chain saw we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds the bomb defusal of course goes wrong but only the furniture is damaged not our heroes who still are needed jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie helping other passengers and frolicking in the water his initial sea sickness is suddenly gone because there are ship crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger he does pretty good job but can blame keanu reeves for declining this part then there willem dafoe the villain who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein monster he doesn succeed though an untidy appearance isn enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential before he tries again to make us believe he is dangerous man he should practise for while in front of mirror can really recommend speed you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren meant to be funny especially the showdown when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles whole village is treat there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie in keeping with last year desaster movie tradition dog is miraculously saved from certain death really funny and meant to be funny scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie had they looked out the window they wouldn have missed the huge ship racing toward them those of you who still want to see the movie should pick theater with large screen and good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects in an adequately equipped theater it as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate but the ilm special effects can save the movie for all the money they could have done better
the tagline for this film is some houses are just born bad so didn expect too much from this but had preserved little spark of ope as entered the theatre thought liam neeson cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont thought mabe it will be fun and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing but by the end of it thought why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones jan de bont these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality here is the story in the monstrously over decorated mansion known as hill house visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor liam neeson into being guinea pigs in fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation among them is sophisticated bisexual cathrine zeta jones cynical dope owen wilson and gentle and emotional lady lily taylor actually the doctor is researching the primordial fear reaction and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens but he gets unexpected help from the house itself it rumbles hums and belches forth remarkable sights portals become veiny stained glass eyeballs fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like sinister mouth filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real placing an emotional wall between audience and screen the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture is that exciting or what the worst thing about it is that it didn have to be bad it based on great book ``the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience the blair witch project that cost less than an old car managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses and with $70 mill budget de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of perfectly lovely piece of terror de bont has style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is in itself frightening he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush but why give him more serious material in the end haunting will only haunt its fledgling studio dream works skg and de bont career as director yet it wouldn be fair to say that everything is bad the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated beautiful mysterious magical and spooky but this is where the good things end the music is blaring the floors moving the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming and all of this every second every moment of screen time is absolutely without life it nothing more than special effects extravaganza visually impressive but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn engage at first you do not know what going on is this part of the experiment are these hallucinations projections of the subconscience paranoia but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening the house is actually possessed it is at that point when all your hopes for good entertainment disappears out of the window for ever sat in anticipation for decent climax and that what got believe hichock once said that it better to wait for climax than to see one this may be true and it might actually work but there is only one problem jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary only stupid they are impossible to take seriously any paralells that you might have heard before linking this picture to kubrick the shining are absolutely baseless shining had class style story acting but most of all talent and originality haunting has only special effects and art direction to boast of and those elements alone are not enough to make it good film casting good actors for small pale parts only makes things worse but guess that no matter what or other critics say or write most of you will see this film anyway even if the tagline would say some films are just born stupid
because no one demanded it david duchovny in romantic comedy at last both his romantic magnetism and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot which could be fodder for valentine day episode of the files bob rueland david duchovny loses his wife elizabeth joely richardson in car accident at the same time grace briggs minnie driver is in the hospital waiting for heart transplant grace gets elizabeth heart and it leads her to bob it the romantic equivalent of all those horror films where someone gets transplant from serial killer and then is driven to slaughter people four writers are credited with contributing to the story that doesn seem possible despite being solid two hours long return to me adds little to the boy meets girl boy loses girl formula and as result is terribly tedious and slow moving duchovny and driver seem unable to generate any sparks and kept wishing for fast forward button to move their scenes along since driver has managed to work well in romantic roles before blame duchovny he out of his element without the manufactured and static sexual tension of his tv series and ve always thought that the relationship between mulder and scully on the files comes off more sibling like than hot and bothered there something about duchovny that makes me uneasy regardless of the role he playing he comes off as weirdo the only redeeming quality of return to me is its hilarious supporting cast the circle of friends and relatives around bob and grace is constantly playing matchmaker and they generate the only laughs in the movie carroll connor is grace grandfather marty reilly when bob comes into marty restaurant after hours marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status when marty discovers that bob is widower he invites bob to join his poker game and introduces him with the declaration this is bob his wife is dead the poker buddies are just as desperate to find mate for grace and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news also funny bonnie hunt as grace best friend megan and james belushi as megan husband joe married with children megan and joe provide useful counterpoint by showing the mundane results of romance although it rare to see him in movie that premieres in theater belushi delivers his lines with great comic skill rounding out the impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bob best friend and robert loggia as marty brother in law angelo in only the lead actors lived up to the standards set by the rest of the cast bottom line if you are compelled to see this movie watch it on video so you can fast forward to scenes with carroll connor and james belushi
in the past tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman and the hilarious ed wood but lately his films just don cut it sleepy hollow has some unique features but the script is terrible mess for those who remember disney fantastic adventures of ichabod crane it is actually superior to this disney version was at least interesting while burton film drags on far too long without any suspense or frights while the stories are similar the new version adds too much to the once likable story and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off ichabod crane johnny depp is now apparently constable who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders the victims are headless and no traces of evidence were found until the murderer reveals himself hence the headless horseman now with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy they must stop the headless horseman from killing spree that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster in the original the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable no one could stop him not even ichabod by the end of the film it had audiences in deep thought burton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere and how to make the main characters heroes he takes no risk what so ever and this is where he fails another pathetic element of the film was the script like said earlier he just stuffed too much in at one time and made it look real sloppy kind of like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims he completely butchered the story to pieces thankfully there are few factors that particularly liked the acting by depp was quite notable he took the nerdy character of the cartoon and simply acted it out in better manner if it wasn for his quirky one liners doubt could have remained awake because quite frankly was getting sleepy just when thought christina ricci was getting to be good actress she winds up doing this it just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up big blockbuster it too tempting to let go even if the script is mush the atmosphere too was quite involving should have just gazed at the sets and the eerie fog rather than actually pay attention to what was going on at least burton films are eye candy even if they are trash the only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads and the fight between the horseman depp and casper van dien other than that wish could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film and just sit back and stare at the scenery by the end can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed this is the biggest disappointment of the year especially when such talented director like burton handles project like this don waste your time or money because your head will feel hollow
wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world and wish that film makers would use commandments as blueprint on how _not_ to do it writer director daniel taplitz has created bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul searching in this tale of seth warner aidan quinn man of faith who runs into streak of bad luck which usually inspires country western lyrics his pregnant wife drowns his home is destroyed by tornado he loses his job and his dog is crippled by bolt of lightning convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant seth decides to break his and sets out to turn every thou shalt not of the ten commandments into thou shalt and vice versa his wife sister rachel friends courteney cox wants to help seth rachel selfish husband harry anthony lapaglia who tends to break few commandments of his own thinks seth is lunatic thus begins film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion taplitz isn interested in treating seth tragedies as genuinely tragic making it impossible to sympathize with him composer joseph vitarelli provides score full of whimsical woodwinds turning seth sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark quinn performance as seth is all wild eyed fervor without any genuine pain the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought with one through five dispatched in five minute montage the result is character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of high concept movie plot it not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth corporate attorney rachel is given case which is supposed to soften hard heart we see no indication she has while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seth false witness only courteney cox strikes note of reality in solid performance she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve even she can force taplitz to decide whose story this is or what we should have learned about dealing with the struggles in our lives and our relationship with the infinite by the time seth makes singularly biblical reappearance late in the film it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience commandments is bad comedy which could have been decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith and the loss thereof at all seriously
the happy bastard quick movie review wild wild west better name for this movie might ve been wild wild waste warner bros in an attempt to get their own men in siyah style of movie had managed to lasso in some big names actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld the duo behind mib success in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster contemporary big screen update to the classic western sci fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad but somehow they ran into problem along the way they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would ve made all the difference story writer wild wild west story and script was compiled by six different people rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in siyah ed solomon if warner bros had gotten him the movie would ve possibly been five times better than what it is heck ten times as is however the story and screenplay is mess filled with dead laughs enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he performing them and complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well here the story us army member james west will smith teams up with creative genius artemus gordon kevin kline to take on ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless kenneth branagh whose lower half was blown off during the civil war leaving him to roll around in steam controlled wheelchair they catch onto plot of his involving superweapon that can basically be considered an 80 foot tarantula although it looks bigger than that hellbent on destroying anything in its path as said the way the script unfolds is complete mess but the acting doesn help either kevin kline is miserable as gordon failing to display even smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado smith seems to be having better time as west although he not nearly as charming as he was in mib branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain perhaps to the point where we can even stand to look at him or his strange beard and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father but mostly she exists just for sexual attention her acting is barely passable but what breath of fresh ass director barry sonnenfeld isn of great help either even though he shows some good creativity at some points his overall urgency for directing is lost it as if he feels he directing tv movie big no no when you re helming what supposed to be big screen hit last but not least there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable at one point smith defies gravity when first boarding kline train he jumps on the back gets launched straight up in the air and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train while it still in motion also he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of lynch mob particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks last but not least why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he not kissing woman as he looking through peephole at the enemy the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects the huge mechanical spider is technical marvel very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show there also good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades but again logic question comes into play regarding their polarity would say sit back and have good time with wild wild west but it really isn possible if the racist and sex jokes don bother you the performances will if the performances don bother you the story will if the story doesn bother you the racist and sex jokes will there no end to the vicious circle go rent men in siyah instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats you ll have better time if you do go keep an eye out for robert conrad in role as president grant bet he wishes he were somewhere else
welcome to your oh so typical sequel it tries to be twice as big as it predecessor yet ends up twice as shallow shallow hmm now there an idea maybe if the ill fated cruise liner in this movie had struck shallow reef early on things may have turned out better the first thing that struck me and surprised me was that the camera work for the opening sequence anyway was terrible looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet very different to the original movie the characters well not many of the characters actually had characters but here rundown annie who was the highlight of the the original must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie why because something got to account for her losing that many iq points even though annie wasn exactly rocket scientist in speed here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against wall for instance after successfully using chainsaw to cut hole in door so that group of people can escape noxious gases she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people can get ut till she get the chainsaw out of their faces bang bang bang in point of fact sandra character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules who constantly has to be rescued jason patric all can say is bring back keanu keanu reeves might have the emotional range of tree stump but that one more tree stump than jason has don think he changed facial expressions all movie jason smile for the cameras now frown said frown oh you are bang bang bang wooden just doesn describe this guys performance but it ll have to do the bad guy ahh william dafoe there bright move how can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledged classic body of evidence yes that is sarcasm his wide eyed maniac of character doesn start out too bad but goes steadily downhill as the movie progresses in the end he degenerates to chasing annie around for hostage even though he already has the money and can escape bang bang though like to give this movie double thumbs down there were some nice sequences considering the movie cost over 100 million dollars you hope there be at least couple the real eye popper for me even though it was given away in the trailer bang bang was the sequence where the cruise liner sideswipes the oil tanker this looks terrific and was very surprised to hear that the cruise liner in it was completely computer generated wow don think ve ever seen cg model look so real before the sequence where jason patric in trying to disable the propellers from under the ship is also terrific and the only time during the entire movie where you get that feeling of speed this lack of speed problem affects many sequences such as the oil tanker part it was oh no we re going to hit the oil tanker 20 minutes later oh no we re going to hit the oil tanker 20 min you get the point this movie failed simply because it didn live up to it name there was very little feeling of speed in the original movie the lead characters had to make split second decisions to survive in this movie it felt more like well people we re gonna run into that there island in few hours think might stroll over to engineering and see if can turn off the engines passing the cafeteria on the way can get anybody anything the ending of this movie really is terrible even though it features what ve since found out is one of the most expensive sequences ever in movie it just doesn work at all the part where the liner crashes through the town looks very realistic but surprise surprise it just takes waaaaay too long it seemed to go for 15 minutes before the ship finally stopped one thing that struck me as extremely poor scriptiing was that as the ship crashes through the harbour and town around 25 people are killed by the ship and there only 15 or so people left on the ship so when it stops safe and sound and the characters are all cheering the audience is sitting back and thinking wait sec this is happy moment because bang bang then there was the dog almost fell out of my seat when saw the bit with the dog dodging the falling debris putting dog in peril has become the ultimate hollywood cliche every movie seems to have dog in danger sequence volcano dante peak independence day daylight twister lost world etc etc this movie is perfect example of how not to make sequel director jan de bont should try watching the orignal movie and this one back to back and see if he realises where he went wrong
you would think that this film dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of brilliant british comedy and americanizing it you be wrong since full blame can be placed on the very folks who wrote and created the series rowan atkinson robin driscoll and richard curtis should you ever happen to meet those chaps do me favor grab them by the hair and yell really loudly in their ear what were you thinking have you ever heard the phrase if it ain broke don fix it then walk away the film concerns mr bean atkinson and his visit to america while escorting the painting of whistler mother to an american buyer played by burt reynolds in the type of bit part that his success in boogie nights should hopefully do away with now how or why mr bean is sent on this trip makes no sense and can even describe how the film explains it the point is that mr bean comes to america and causes wacky trouble problems problems problems where to begin first the score music from the tv show has been completely replaced by score that is either at times one note away from the score from beetlejuice or one note away from the score from rob roy then the song choices are totally uninspired good vibrations love wow don put any thought into that guys also bean makes way too much noise in the film the character doesn speak much but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience and maybe the occasional murmur from mr bean each episode was like chaplin silent movie in the film bean is constantly moaning grunting whining etc it annoying and just plain wrong for the character the main problem though is that it just not funny with each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than 30 minutes multiply that running time by three however and the laughs steadily decrease they even have the gaul to repeat jokes from the series sad and creatively lazy as series mr bean only ran for about 13 episodes or so why on earth did atkinson and the gang decide it was time to completely rework everything 13 half hour episodes certainly hadn exhausted all possible situations all can say positively for the film at this point is that it almost appropriate for all ages if it wasn for couple of scenes where it appears as though mr bean is having sex with things and even that isn very positive statement please guys go back to england and go back to television so you ll make me laugh again [pg 13]
it actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode the phantom menace because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy and no really don feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the box office really don not at all the plot has been done before mysterious unaddressed love letter shows up in small town causing confusion for everyone who reads it the center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen kate capshaw and by the way what is it with bookstore owner main characters in the past year and half we ve seen them in life is beautiful you ve got mail this movie and the upcoming notting hill who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore she immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from and comes to the incorrect conclusion that the author of the note is young employee played by tom everett scott he reading the letter himself assumes that she wrote it for him after while they fall in love well duh kate feels guilty about getting in relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman tom selleck to add to her turmoil her mother shows up blythe danner who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about and her trusted bookstore manager deadpan ellen degeneres quits supporting characters aren called supporting for nothing their purpose isn just to move the plot along they re also supposed to give the storyline backbone to do this they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting rarely can movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed dull cardboard secondary characters especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonist various interactions with them this is the love letter damning error capshaw character is as good as have seen present in recent romantic comedies but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely one dimensional because of that the love letter is awkward and insincere even worse it bore liked capshaw and her helen but everyone else is painfully fake undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist there is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either and besides degeneres wisecracks there little that is even little amusing this is not completely thoughtless film and director peter ho sun chan does good job of portraying helen yearnings and various subtle complexities but it far from profound there isn common theme running through the proceedings thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless really this is harmless little movie it far from an abomination and it not torturous to sit through but bad it is awful it also is the love letter is failure and an inane failure at that 1999 eugene novikov&#137
was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of kirmizi corner and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws but if you ask me the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for fellow american or more the point anyone that allows him to bask in his own less than subtle presence this is not an insult to gere as consider him to be rather talented actor but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role if film is solely about one person the main actor must give faultless performance in order for it to really work although geres performance is in no way poorly acted it is far from perfect and look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry film by himself this is where he truly belongs and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear with the sensational edward norton the jackal with bruce willis and pretty woman with the delightful julia roberts in kirmizi corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear bold and up front who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind it is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail it doesnt take long from the films beginning for jack moores charm to work on pretty chinese lady and in no time they are in bed together in hotel room drunk and cheerful yet instead of hangover poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on couch he is arrested and hauled into chinese prison his cell food and rights all terrible now trapped in foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy lawyer shen yuelin bai ling defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder jack and shen argue about their countries different laws shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family as the plot thickens scenes get progressively more ridiculous ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to scooby doo ending where the least expected but you knew along criminal is discovered red corner is one of those films where you sneer laugh or vomit youre way through all of its minutes what should have been politically taunt thriller is little more than pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act this is not to say that the film does not have its moments there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption but what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place perhaps this is why kirmizi corner is so frustrating to watch if you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly the basic idea is quite tangible it is upon the films execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate the evidence that goes missing the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before if that wasnt bad enough kirmizi corners dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions shen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of destitute relationship with her deceased father whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on plan to free himself taking itself far too seriously kirmizi corner is not half the film it intends to be although it would have benefited from the help of more valuable supporting cast the films main fault is in the bizarre and often out of place way of unfolding story which isnt that meritorious anyway whilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as decent actor would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such serious yet hollow drama again martin vailwhere are you
at the end of an action scene in lara croft tomb raider wall collapses near the nubile warrior with her face on the floor she gazes into the rubble then grins abruptly and says oh my car keys mention this scene because it was the only moment in the whole damned production that made me smile based on an incredibly popular video game lara croft tomb raider is lousy movie the structure goes like this poorly staged action sequence boring exposition poorly staged action sequence boring exposition etc etc the end basically the film exists to showcase angelina jolie puffy lips and enhanced tits close ups are framed oh so carefully to include her million dollar bazooms running scenes highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage baywatch fashion there even include shower scene that offers brief side view of them but the filmmakers are so inept they can even flash the audience correctly the one extended display of nudity is of get ready for this guy for no particular reason muscular supporting character strolls around naked for about 30 seconds with each shot composed to barely cover his package la austin powers now enjoy good looking male body as much as the next gay guy but what the hell is beefcake doing in t&a flick aimed at heterosexual males of course what else should one expect in film that does virtually nothing right tomb raider sets up elaborate action set pieces then renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing promising dual bungee cord battle is ruined by excessive cuts it promises series of exotic locales then delivers cavernous sets and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies throw in some bargain basement computer graphics and you end up with the ugliest movie to come down the pike in many moons intended to be rousing indiana jones style adventure tomb raider lacks any sense of tension the low point comes when lara is threatened by statues of monkey warriors and giant multi armed shiva figure that come to life courtesy of cgi easily the lamest menaces have ever seen the creatures move like snails and fall apart with single shot from gun if you ever have to be chased by monsters pray that you get the monkey warriors tomb raider tells story sort of once every 000 years the planets align group of very bad men are out to find two halves of an object that if reassembled just as the planets align will give them control over time itself lara goal is to stop them and rescue her long missing poppa jon voight jolie real life dad none of this matters though because stunning gaps in internal logic assure that the plot of lara croft tomb raider is as lame as ever other aspect of the film except angelina jolie lips and breasts
did do something bad must have because sitting through this movie was sheer punishment here the plot ricky jeff goldblum is producer of the good buy network one of those 24 hour home shopping channels the new boss robert loggia plans to can ricky behind if he doesn turn the previous months flat sales numbers around and to add to his problems ricky also has to work with kate kelly preston the ivy league wunderkind whom the boss has brought with him kate and ricky don get along and don have any great ideas until they meet eddie murphy spiritualist who sees something positive in everything his soothing voice and simple logic makes people feel good and it this quality that will make the new gbn television star and the key to the network success the first problem is flaw in the plot sure makes people feel good sure we re told that most people feel guilty after buying an impulse item no matter how wealthy they might be and ll even believe that talks talk that allows people to feel good about what they ve bought but hey that after they ve bought it why do sales skyrocket the first time is on camera far from trying to sell the product instead blathers on about how you don even need the thing someone please tell me how this is supposed to move merchandise in the first place you might say that people feel good about what they ve bought so they come back and by more but due to the simple fact that the first round of sales in inexplicable not convinced this is what the filmmakers had in mind the whole movie is therefore seriously undermined because the key point in the plot is never credible another problem is in the humor you know if you see that eddie murphy is in movie think it is not unreasonable for you to expect that the film is comedy whoa partner are you in for surprise holy man is not funny murphy the one asset you think this movie has remember how they brought him in at the last minute to save best defense then again maybe you don is seriously reigned in the script gives him almost nothing to work with and it seems as though director stephen herek kept him toned down so that the other actors in the film wouldn be left as window dressing there only one moment in the film where murphy is allowed to let loose and it lasts for three shouted words which seem totally out of place as result pathetic in all there are about three jokes that work in the entire picture and they re not even that great as side note there are some cameo appearances such as dan marino pitching contraption which allows you to cook off of your car engine and james brown introducing medic alert device that shouts help me just like the hardest working man in show business at the push of button but these never cause your personal laugh meter to rise above the level of mild bemusement well you ask surely there must be some convincing performances to make up for the lack of humor think again buckwheat jeff goldblum disappoints kelly preston is flat but not like that robert loggia in the kind of role for which he has been virtually typecast can do anything with it the script is part of the problem but these actors don even look like they believe in the move they re making they look lot like they re bored just like the audience so what do you have when the humor is absent from your comedy and the acting is like the siberian steppes film that drags more than dropped anchor but wait as if these problems don make the film slow enough the screenplay pacing makes the movie even slower it takes the entire first half hour to establish the movie premise then more time as the film wades through tortuous and seemingly mandatory romance between ricky and kate and sub plot involving conniving pr man eric mccormack who wants to discredit and take over ricky job as producer when the pr guy plan is foiled the film is climaxes we re treated to that little epilogue and then we can all go home right wrong the movie goes on for another half hour continental drift is the indy 500 compared to the pace of holy man the only thing holy about holy man will surely be the number of people exclaiming holy @#% that movie was awful this one is for the truly pious
the cartoon is way better that the bottom line on disney incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature the alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced frenetic home alone with puppies and not much else when production of this remake was announced the big question seemed to be why the original cartoon still works so what the point the answer it appears is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandising campaign the story for those of you who missed childhood is simple two dalmatians pongo and perdy fall in love at first sight they drag their human pets together and in short time both couples marry the heavenly match ups turn chaotic when pongo and perdy new born pups are stolen their dog napping engineered by the evil cruella devil who wants them for their pelts everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in frantic effort to save the puppies in the original movie the animated pooches had broad range of facial expressions and distinct personalities we also could hear them talk which quickly established crucial element to the charm of the film the dog view of humans as their pets in the new version the dogs are mute and expressionless hughes attempts to give them character with repeated shots of the dalmatians draping their heads over each other and licking their faces and necks while he drew the desired aww they re so cute reaction from the audience it was quickly followed by several people whispering wonder what kind of food they smeared on the dog heads to get them licking like that the canines lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had little joely richardson and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles in previous films daniels successfully played off his beyaz bread persona in something wild he revealed the rebellious thrill seeker beneath his neutral demeanor in terms of endearment his hapless appearance masked cold manipulative womanizer here he and richardson are so consistently bland that it wonder their images even stick to the film glenn close however has no problems establishing distinct personality as the villainous icon cruella devil she tears up the screen in deliciously over the top performance close matches the intensity of the animated cruella by becoming cartoon herself with two tone fright wig kirmizi gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips garish animal skin outfits and stiletto heels close bursts through her scenes like force of nature she clearly having ball playing this monstrous icon and her wicked glee is infectious when she spits out lines like you ve won the battle but about to win the wardrobe the film comes briefly to life 101 dalmatians is crammed with john hughes typical heavy handed approach to comedy after an ingenuous opening showing pongo morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on careening trek through city park little slapstick goes long way but hughes just keeps laying it on the second half of the film where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil and her henchmen is tedious home alone clone with the bad guys enduring variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy scratchy cartoon including thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence 101 dalmatians has cute puppies and hoot of performance from glenn close but not enough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick bland characters and unconvincing animatronic raccoons high fiving one another rent the cartoon
spawn may be somewhat of an older film in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn seen it will finally get to see it that is if they see it but managed to catch it before it made it way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and god forbid video cassette purchasing it wasn the worst film of year by any means it isn even on the top of the worst films of the year but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten which in simpler terms means it comes in at number on my worst of 1997 list the only reason it doesn come in lower is thanks to the special effects which might actually have been some of the best of the year performances however were either wooden or for the most part unforgivingly campy in fact this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness even the editing seemed to boast campy quality don know how to explain that one it wasn exactly choppy but something about it seemed well annoyingly unprofessional john leguizamo almost makes it as clown but not quite he is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional but the main problem found with spawn as with most films that wind up on my worst of lists is that it was just plain boring wouldn even say there was climax to the film sure it had the big battle scene at the end but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing conclusion never too soon the movie did conclude in very simple disappointing way even though it one of the shorter movies ve seen this year it one that would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again like said the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride no matter how small was impressed with the opening sequence so long as didn allow the melodramatic voice over and lobotomizing editing to get to me and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawn outfit created but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes which looked quite bit like modern video game who knows if spawn the video game wasn part of the plan from the beginning keeping in mind that the film was based on comic book makes it somewhat more approachable and in very small amount makes up for the cheeziness of it all but none of this movie saving graces can it make it something recommend seeing no matter what the price of admission this movie is definitely not for young children which shouldn really be problem seeing as how only teenagers if anyone would likely find it appealing if you really want to catch movie there are many better ones out there no matter what your tastes might be trust me spawn has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers
shagadellic groovy baby smashing adorn the page ad for this movie tabbed as the #1 comedy in america as of may 8th did we attend the same movie at 87 minutes it seemed overlong like snl skit on steroids and at any length it seemed unfunny yes the sets and costumes were an interesting exaggeration of 60s pop frills and yes the concept dealing with 60s secret agent pop icon played by myers awakened from his cryogenic slumber to battle his arch enemy dr evil also played by myers in the present day had great deal of potential fun costumes and scenery and potential do not movie make so lets throw in hefty dose of bathroom humor don get me wrong like good bubbles in the bathtub joke as much as the next person but to have this type of humor be the funniest thing about your movie is waste of yuor talent and my money but the way things work these days in the movie business all film has to do is call itself the funniest and people will believe it do give this film stars because of the sets costumes and sadly unmet potential

violence is bad violence is ugly violence breeds yet more violence kids don try this at home this weighty message isn the only barrier to enjoying brother but it certainly one of the largest written directed by and starring the infamous takeshi kitano kikujiro sonatine brother is his first film made outside his familial japan bringing the yakuza tradition to los angeles yakuza translated for the average american is the japanese mafia if you piss family member off or dishonor yourself in any way the usual punishment is public display of self mutilation usually resulting in the loss of limbs definition of dishonor can be anything from making stupid decision to leaving one family for another it would be interesting to know more about where these and other customs come from unfortunately the film doesn give too much of an explanation assuming its audience is aware of kitano earlier work there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members leading one to assume they would be symbolic of something but you never know what then there scene in which man kills himself in front of rival in exchange for that rival joining the family granted this is one of the best scenes in the movie but it doesn make lot of sense instead the two hours are basically spent watching the following people go out and shoot each other talk about it for ten plus minutes then go out and do it again the consistently repetitive discussion of territory during these moments involuntarily provokes yawning there are also plot details thrown in for no identifiable purpose all of the sudden yamamoto kitano has girlfriend he barely speaks to her treats her like crap and then sends her away another missed opportunity considering it is such big deal for kitano to bring his magic to the united states is the combination of cultures which rely too heavily on overused stereotypes though slow moving brother does have good elements the action scenes are well directed clearly defined and interesting to watch some of the violence is more hinted at than shown which produces the luscious squirm that one goes to see such films for the actors would be more enticing if they had more to do shirase masaya kato loud sarcastic coolness set against yamamoto quietly threatening attitude is truly an entertaining combination their moments together or apart steal the rest of the show also to its credit brother tackles the cause and effect of crime with realism life of crime is easy to get sucked into with the first reward of quick cash sure people get rich but they can also lose just as easily it great moral with great cast just not much substance to back it up
the tagline on random hearts reads in perfect world they never would have met in perfect world never would have seen this movie the biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film kay chandler kristin scott thomas and dutch van den broeck harrison ford are the only two major characters alive resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two hours and then some production dutch is sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department kay is congresswoman from new hampshire although they both think they are happily married their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs dutch and kay are soon widowed when plane goes down carrying their partners they subsequently discover the affair the rest of the film is the pointless unrealistic and often times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to and getting to know each other in the process two sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film dutch is trying to arrest fellow officer task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare all the great stereotypes get pulled including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter kay distraction from the film primary focus is her campaign for re election and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on pedestal these sub plots could have made for semi interesting points but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother daughter relations in depth and consequently suffers random hearts two primary characters seem to live in shells although both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other there is plenty of opportunity dutch having partner and kay having close friends and her daughter but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships veteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack and critically acclaimed up and comer dylan baker both have cameo roles but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both other than its weak plot it is hard to criticize random hearts however it is also hard to compliment it had the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like well frosted cake rather than the dry one that equates to be
the fab of ronald reagan high are four stuck up girls played by rose mcgowan rebecca gayheart julie benz and charlotte roldan who overdress like posh spice wannabes their daily ritual is to parade up and down the school halls like royalty and their constant reflex action is to grab their compacts so they can check their make up and powder their cheeks under no circumstances will they ever let themselves be seen eating in public in writer and director darren stein jawbreaker it isn as funny as it sounds in fact it isn funny at all stein has taken the siyah comedy of teen movie like heathers and stripped it of any intelligence wit or charm his actresses toss off their lines so fast that they don have time to add any emotion and all of his female characters have considerably more lipstick than brains the setup for the movie has one of the fab liz who is referred to as the princess di of reagan high be killed when prank by the other goes wrong the princess di reference is in bad taste as is much of the movie granted bad taste can sometimes be funny but the mere presence of bad taste doesn guarantee it liz girlfriends stick jawbreaker that is literally larger than golf ball in her mouth tape her mouth shut and stick her bound body in the trunk of car when they open the trunk later liz is dead they eventually put her mavi and bruised body into sexual position and make it look like liz was the victim of brutal rape these realistic and disgusting scenes of dead seminude teen have pornographic feeling that is hard to forget and will likely turn the stomach of many viewer the film dialog not only isn funny it trite one nerdy young girl introduces herself with my name is fern mayo as in hold the mayo when fern discovers what has happened the fab make her an offer she can refuse make up they cake it on her and welcome her to the clan the parents in the movie brag about learning parenting skills from watching oprah the teachers fare no better especially in the ridiculous lines they are given miss shayne please cover your bosom one young teacher who has been made up to look old and ugly says without any conviction this is learning institution not brothel besides the obvious question of why this movie was ever made there is one other question that like to ask the director why do you have phone number start with 555 if you going to cover the rest of the number anyway in cameo pam grier plays detective vera cruz who investigates liz murder as she interrogates the other people she stares at them like they are all idiots proving that she is the only one that gets it am sure that if the hard nosed detective cruz were to see this movie she walk out after about minutes and you be well advised to do the same if you should happen to find yourself in theater showing it jawbreaker runs 27 it is rated for violence gore profanity and sex would advise everyone to avoid it but if teenagers go they should be older and mature
when the mediums in question are video game and feature film has there ever been respective here to there transformation that achieved any ground higher than noodle headed mediocrity super mario bros street fighter and mortal kombat were silly stinkers all and now the empty execrable wing commander joins their lowly ranks enduring this spectacularly bad bit of sci fi easily the worst of its kind is like watching someone futz around with video game for 100 minutes that is to say there little fun to be had when you re not the one holding the joystick the movie then is missed opportunity for director chris roberts who created the original groundbreaking pc incarnation of wing commander back in 1990 how an interactive brainchild so revered could end up such cinematic pile of junk under the helm of the same guy is head scratcher wing commander story credited to roberts and screenwriter kevin droney is clueless chaos melding incoherent narrative and unoriginal ideas it rips off the finest films of its genre top gun and in one scene even those spiffy stereoscopic freeze gap commercials set in 2654 wing commander stars freddie prinze jr as daredevil cosmos cowboy who hopes to be great fighter pilot like his father before him along the way he plays kissy face with his stoic superior saffron burrows at the new galaxy hangout where he posted comes to terms with bigots who resent him for his pilgrim heritage don ask and goes on top secret mission involving the jump coordinates what no death star plans of nasty alien race known as the kilrathi or something like that given the immensely confusing activity it hard to tell on the other hand what easy to see is that wing commander is big old mess the lame dialogue strains filled with such original lines as don you die on me battle stations and repeated and frequently unanswered calls for medic action sequences fizzle the character conflict garners unintentional giggles the sole source of suspense here is what these kilrathi creeps look like as they re kept out of view until the concluding 15 minutes imagine bearded siamese cats crossed with something from 50s roger corman cheapie and you ve got good idea little but techno babble happens for an hour and then it as if wing commander tries to do too much at once when it appears as though the movie about to show signs of pulse it instead provides hilarious touch of human drama culminating with use for bulldozer that has probably never been seen in this kind of space camp before matthew lillard featured prominently in said sequence is cast as prinze hotshot partner and though the two are fine young actors recently paired in the hit she all that they re fighting more than otherworldly evil here rumor has it that wing commander was slated as later in the year release bumped up to capitalize off this hot casting coup as well as the premiere of the new star wars episode trailer but in my audience there were no females present to make goo goo eyes at prinze or lillard and many member exited after the much ballyhooed sneak peek since most cineplexes won be granting refunds to the latter contingency commander might rake in some dough but be warned the high wears off as soon as the coming attraction gives way to the feature presentation
it almost amusing to watch 21 year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potter follow up to 1997 the tango lesson the man who cried the gen actress with her cold stare and big siyah eyes has appeared in an impressive range of films but she doesn even come close to being the bold heroine the film set against the historical backdrop of world war requires her to be ricci whose character is shockingly silent and blank showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett quite an amusing sight to behold blanchett lola paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie is bold interesting and layered everything our heroine lacks co star of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy blanchett has good seven inches on ricci sports twice the makeup and dons flashy wardrobe the actress inhabits the role as she always so remarkably does with fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the film lead rather than her dull companion important historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film these landmarks serve as the film little conflict obviously the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues the man who cried has many aspirations none of which come full circle by the film close there are forced messages here and there go forward always go forward lola preaches to suzie there romance between suzie and fellow target of hitler nazis the gypsy cesar johnny depp who like ricci barely gets to speak lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it and at the core of all these devices lies suzie desire to travel to america where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago the film main problem is that potter isn skilled enough to tell the epic sized story of suzie the time period instability the conflicting social classes the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life serving as both writer and director potter throws in some of each but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any by the time the sigh inducing climax hits the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater the film falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely are we really meant to believe any of this could happen contrastingly in its moving final scene the man who cried strikes note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film although it apparent that potter can grasp what she reaches puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place ricci suzie is meant to be the film core from the extended flashback at the film beginning to the quickly drawn ending everything seen in the film in some way relates to her so why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals the character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble but not present enough for the film to be ricci the almost constant lack of flow and one note tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha vierny beautiful cinematography that renders the film various locations wonderfully also worthy of note are lindy hemming costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely and then there the music from minute one to minute ninety seven there hardly moment when the wavering skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music don undercut the action the notes stricken both overwhelm particularly john turturro portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio whose money and reputation catch lola interest and accompany oftentimes the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the film characters and reinforce that state potter obviously cares much about each and every musical note unfortunately the same effort isn given towards almost everything else
the premise of the new james wong film final destination is that alex browning the protagonist prevents six of his friends from boarding doomed airplane thereby cheating fate however fate is not so easily bested and alex friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances essentially this premise is clever way to make slasher flick without the slasher unfortunately this is practically the only clever thing about the film as far as teen horror flicks go final destination is better than many there is enough shocking death graphic gore and requisite siyah humor to provide the essential roller coaster type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick unfortunately this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre the relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set up the next death the scene where two of the characters break into funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue have witnessed if you are looking for saturday night thriller to scare your date this film might do the trick other than that wait until it goes into heavy rotation on cable
adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy the wedding singer unfortunately that also has the effect of softening his edge he nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore not that it was much of one he certainly not helped here by rather frail plot the year is 1985 letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia adam sandler is nice guy robbie the titular wedding singer who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits robbie life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee linda angela featherstone leaves him at the altar however things are looking up when he meets julia drew barrymore waitress at the hall she the perfect woman but for one small flaw she engaged to be married to slick junk bond king glenn matthew glave so most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love and his attempts to stop the wedding as far as plots go it pretty thin and tired one to fill the gaps the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia from boy george to michael jackson from miami vice to dallas from the first cds to the last rubik cubes this film revels in all the minutiae and then there the music learning lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank and romy and michele high school reunion this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow as result most songs get maybe lyric or half but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives eyes the wedding singer vols and while the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring at least they distract you from the plot at least last year my best friend wedding stirred up the standard keep your true love from marrying someone else plot by making the rival nice person here glenn is such lowly rat of man that you never see what julia saw in him barrymore on the other hand is simply charming as julia which leaves us with adam sandler he at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades little such as when he has breakdown on stage during wedding reception when he in full nice guy mode he more pathetic than endearing the film boasts several cameos most notably by steve buscemi and jon lovitz but none of them work well at all buscemi role as drunken best man simply fails to be humorous lovitz on the other hand as rival wedding singer makes you long for his good old days on saturday night live where he was actually funny the only cameo which has some appeal is guest appearance by classic 80s rocker during the film finale surprisingly one of the only plot related scenes which actually works adam sandler still has some work to do before he can become dependable leading man while he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer the end result is no net gain
capsule silly and inane adaptation of gibson short story which is nowhere in sight gibson script only adds insult to injury johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie say awesomely because it one thing to fail but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged keanur reeves who is terrible stars as johnny an information courier who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head he is given one last job whenever you are in movie and you hear those words run which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories but it only followed up on in token fashion for his trouble johnny gets chased by the yakuza who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high tech thrillers what funny is that if you watch gangster movies made in japan there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics but of course there no room in this movie for any of that the yakuza are simply used to point guns wave swords flaunt tattoos and grimace menacingly could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies bound by honor sugar hill and american me come to mind when asians remain perpetually stereotyped but that another essay anyway johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark why newark maybe because it was cheaper to fake future newark than future new york that why there he meets an assortment of odd characters ice dolph lundgren and henry rollins play whole gallery of weirdos the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture it turns out what else that the data in johnny head could save lot of people but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesn kill him handled right this could have been absorbing but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other better movies blade runner and brazil come to mind everything looks run down and scummy everyone dresses like they re punk rockers and videophones are commonplace snore the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves but kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively un technical fellow would think it would look and behave like hacker of johnny caliber would be blasting away with one command line function after another instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms but of course that not cinematic whatever what went wrong with this movie gibson wrote his own screenplay which guess is part of the problem what works as short story doesn work in movie his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesn advance it convulses from the script on out it was probably all downhill renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless there no fun in kicking wounded dog is there

moviegoers stretched around the block some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get good seat in the theater they need not have wasted their time the movie is billed as comedy but is surprisingly bereft of humor there are noticeable attempts at laughs but very few tries actually click wondered if there were jokes that wasn getting because not from china but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn be attributed to the cultural barrier either keep cool just isn very funny the prelude to the film was visit by keep cool producer who with the help of an interpreter regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii although the print made it the assistant luggage was lost too bad that story wasn in the movie because it got big laugh qu ying the film female lead was also on hand to give few comments however whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed ms ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one fast paced incredibly long tirade it was dizzying good foreshadowing for the film you see keep cool is filmed almost totally with camera handheld by man with bad case of the shakes at least that the way it seems since the camera is constantly moving cinema verite is one thing but panning and shaking around until your audience has headache is another although some might consider it form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing found it thoroughly distracting and after while quite annoying headache as said the film is about young bookseller wen jiang who is after young woman qu ying they used to be romantically involved but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship the first half of the film is about the young man plan to win her back of course the thing is she doesn want to be won back and has nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up bit in the fight the young man grabs laptop computer belonging to bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker but only ends up smashing it against lamppost we later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced there is funny scene the only one in the film where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner baotian li in order to recoup his losses there is no sense to be made out of the young woman behavior cold one minute caring the next so we feel no sympathy for her character the bookseller would be better off without her although the second half of the film causes us to lose lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner hand as revenge for the beating he took it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man while the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation his quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to brick wall half the time friendship develops between the two men but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate although only an hour and half in length keep cool contains extraneous material the whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out since we don see her from the midpoint on case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner and would have saved us from the bookseller boring pursuit during the first half but of course this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour there are few things that keep cool does right as mentioned before the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good although it grows tiresome the reasoning with the unreasonable is nice exercise in logic and represents the differences in thinking between generations in one scene for example the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted and that it means something entirely different also effective is the way zhang sets up tension within scene such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner the nightclub owner is counting out money slapping each bundle of currency on the table with every shot of his hand we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge unfortunately these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film shortcomings and weren enough to prevent that headache from lingering after left the theater
movie concepts are often pitched to producers with mathematical formulas involving successful films of the past so undoubtedly one day someone said evolution it ghostbusters plus men in black plus tremors and so it is sum total none the alienbusting begins when meteor lands in glen canyon arizona community college science profs ira kane david duchovny and harry block orlando jones take some samples from the meteor and discover that one celled organisms from inside it are evolving rapidly doing in hours what took millions of years for life on earth just about the time was wondering hey doesn the government usually come in and take over the whole area in these movies the government came in and took over the whole area the leader of the pack gen woodman ted levine turns out to be an old nemesis of ira and ira and harry are blocked from doing further research meanwhile the organisms continue to grow until they are large enough to start attacking people by this time ira and harry have gained friend in dr allison reed julianne moore of the center for disease control country club poolboy wayne green seann william scott has also attached himself to the merry band but can they find the means to stop the aliens in time director ivan reitman seems to be revisiting his biggest hit 1984 ghostbusters but evolution falls miserably short one reason is readily apparent ghostbusters had three really funny guys as its scientists bill murray dan aykroyd and harold ramis but evolution has one really funny guy orlando jones who can adlib and milk the comic potential of lines that prove useless in anyone else hands for good measure ghostbusters had the comic talents of rick moranis evolution offers seann william scott who was much funnier in american pie and road trip than he is here scott has one amusing scene where he sings you are so beautiful to me to dragon like alien to draw it into trap other than that scott seems unable to make much of the thin material the writers gave him an actor in search of forte david duchovny looked for his gritty action hero side in playing god and his romantic side in return to me now he wants to find his wacky comedic talent what we all find is that he doesn have any look for him to be back on tv in five years or so another sad case is julianne moore who needs to be more selective about the offers she accepts she talented actress with an impressive list of credits and award nominations so why is she trying to do slapstick comedy her character has tendency to trip over and bump into things but the trait comes off as pathetic plea for laughs the sole saving grace of the film is jones he at the center of the movie funniest scene where an alien bug invades harry body and has to be pulled out through his ass jones is the only cast member who can take the comedic ball and run with it but he can carry the whole movie by himself he found himself in similar situation in the replacements where he was also the only comic talent in an ensemble cast jones will eventually find the project that will make him major comedy star but this isn it
apparently when crap calls jim carrey answers here he is mugging it up in countless unfunny ways for the fifth time his second go around in the role of pet detective ace ventura that means more talking ass cracks penis jokes and cries of al lrighty then it all adds up to sequel that makes the original resemble schindler list in terms of dramatic merit or lack of granted there are few laughs amid the constant barrage of pre school humor but anyone who appreciates good comedy will bang their head against the wall ten times for every minor chuckle it painful experience for anyone with brain ace is distraught after accidentally dropping racoon into canyon in parody of the opening scene of sylvester stallone cliffhanger jim carrey being the only person who can make stallone look like college professor in terms of intellect or lack of and decides to retire to the mountains of tibet to gain higher level of consciousness or in his case level of consciousness but he is pulled out of retirement to the tune of $20 000 to retrieve sacred beyaz bat for an african tribe why africa so carrey can disguise himself nude inside fake rhino and later climb out the rear end as tourist family watches look the rhino about to give birth if that seems like hee haw humor to you by all means see the movie if not claim your place in human civilization with the rest of us obviously there are quite few nonmembers of civilization who made this movie like the first ace ventura film use the word film only because it was filmed not because there any level of artistic merit huge success in fact carrey only has career because of the decline of intelligence in our culture you may say to me but andrew look at jerry lewis he was born with negative and look how popular he was thirty years ago maybe but still say jerry lewis is notch or two up on the comedic ladder because he never actually did an impression in movie of rabid bulldog biting off man testicles lewis at least had the dignity to save that performance for when company came over
we are grateful that we have the songs of grace chan to comfort us starring lee kang sheng yang kuei mei directed by tsai ming liang written by tsai and yang ping ying cinematography by liao peng jung taiwan 24 12 99 the millenium approaches an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city sectors of the city are being sealed quarantined due to the onset of mysterious virus the virus causes people to act like insects they crawl about on all fours hide from bright lights huddle in damp corners the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in week time residents are advised to evacuate the area asap this premise kafka by way of cronenberg is the background for the hole which could have been great movie but sadly ends up as waste of good ideas the quick sketch above suggests dark absurd hallucinatory near future parable of life in the late 20th century in execution however it is nothing like that the virus the evacuation the visual possiblities of the deluge these are all relegated to the background instead the hole focuses on the lives for want of better word of man lee kang sheng and woman yang kuei mei who live in the same apartment building and who have no personalities the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile the charmless rooms and corridors of post industrial apartment complex photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible it vivid setting but an unappealing one especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background the man lives in the apartment directly above the woman one day repairman investigating leak leaves small hole in the floor of the man living room opening into the ceiling of the woman living room this hole symbol of the solitary opening in the character lonely compartmented lives allows them to interact in unusual and mostly non verbal ways example the man suffering from the onset of the virus or so assume everything is obscure in this movie vomits through the hole the woman wandering around in the dark accidentally puts her hand on his vomit and then cleans it up this is what passes for meaningful communication and they say romance is dead much of the film does not even focus on their interactions such as they are there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people they are ciphers instead we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives we watch for instance as the woman boils some water pours it onto some noodles then eats the noodles this is as fascinating as it sounds offered as counterpoint or perhaps relief to these dreary sequences are series of musical numbers fantasies in which the woman lip synchs to pop songs by grace chan popular so told in 1950s china she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights sometimes in these fantasies she is joined by the man these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality but they fail when the man and the woman dance it seems half hearted and listless astaire and rogers this is not even in imagination these people are numb weary boring the hole is part of the collection 2000 series group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium others include canada last night brazil midnight and american hal hartley the book of life the book of life is the only other one that have seen and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry witty energetic humane it makes the the hole seem ahem empty american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements quick cuts superficial emotions foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time and call it art the hole is self evidently film about alienation and perhaps director tsai ming liang wants the audience to share in his characters alienation if so he succeeds perhaps it is challenge he dares us to enjoy this movie despite his best attempts to ensure that we don if it was challenge wasn up for it
looked at the internet movie database awards section for this film and found that this was nominated for golden globe for best picture drama anyone who seen this film can back me up on this this is the worst of the great disaster films and that not really saying lot for this film earthquake is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured on video it bland and slow moving film which gives us bunch of different characters the disaster film requisite then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster while this worked in say the towering inferno it doesn here for one single reason we don care about any of the characters the film gives us charlton heston in one of many crap 70s films he made including skyjacked and that classic soylent green as rich man married to ava gardner who is having little affair with young single mom genieveve bujold renegade police officer on suspension george kennedy in his least humored performance in the second weirdest subplot motorcycle stuntman richard roundtree right after his shaft thing whose big stunt is he goes on little track that goes upside down yea snore and the weirdest subplot military man bag boy at grocery store who has little thing for buxom victoria principal and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair in smaller subplots there pointless bit about people who are flying over the city in the film by the way one who playing cards and married to boring non acting husband you think this one can go nowhere guess again he gets interested in the final frames there genieveve bujold moron son who has little adventure with wires and for some much needed comedy there walter matthau billed as walter mutha the only laugh in the film as wild drunkard who big moment is dance he does at critical time as for the actual earthquake it rather let down there full hour of character setups none of which is interesting then about 10 minutes of shaking crumbling and bit where house almost falls on bujold narrowly missing this film needed that whole theatre shaking they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored there little suspense following the quake although this film tries for it there an adventure in crumbling high rise office building the wires with the kid and the movement of people who are all injured but none of these are all too suspenseful the finale with the heston gardner bujold love triangle is ended in basic flip of the coin bit which brings out big let down and there no real finale even volcano ended nicely and that movie really sucked not only is it hokey but you don care about any character who cares if heston dies who cares if he choses bujold or gardner although would have chosen gardner mainly on the basis that she can actually act who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid stunt who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires and who cares about that whole plane spiel if anything earthquake is worth viewing for the same reason glen or glenda is mean laughed at this more than did at bio dome but that another story and review in short earthquake gives disaster pics bad name
alexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft played character of dashing swordsman artagnon in director peter hyam adventure the musketeer for some reason that may figure out later don know why the time money and effort were put into the making of the musketeer it may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this film xin xin xiong once upon time in china and yuen woo ping from crouching tiger hidden dragon the result is mix of genres that don mesh well elements of the ritz brothers style comedy for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939 the three musketeers the man with no name from fistful of dollars artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the matrix crowd alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters the real problem with the the musketeer lies in the casting of the two lead romantically intertwined characters artagnan and francesca mena suvari chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character la chris donnell but lacks any onscreen charisma suvari has the doe eyed pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen but she too does not have the chemistry to command the screen if the musketeer makes them any money they should invest in acting lessons stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one the supporting cast is on the surface impressive catherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty dignity and humor especially when she plays off of artagnan mentor planchet jean pierre castaldi who reminds of andre the giant in the princess bride stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu but is given very little to help flesh out his character tim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal chief henchman febre he is so bad he makes simon legree look like boy scout the rest of the players particularly the three musketeers aramis nick moran lock stock and two smoking barrels porthos steve spiers and athos jan gregor kremp are background fodder whose role is to come to artagnan aid when needed peter hyam does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions artagnan takes on tavern full of thugs and bests them single handed he fights gang of febre henchmen aboard speeding coach to protect the queen with the obligatory branches hanging over the road he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy febre who murdered artagnan folks years before it is all routine stuff the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap defying gravity up walls and from horse to horse it works in sci fi film like the matrix or in classical fantasy like crouching tiger hidden dragon but just calls attention to itself in the musketeer at one point could swear saw the stunt wire being used it did not make me believer and am very disappointed with run time of 106 minutes it should have been more like 80 and give it
the year is barely week old and there is already candidate for the worst of 1997 the relic would be chiller that more successful at making the audience laugh than scream in this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams whose last two pictures were dreadful jean claude van damme vehicles creature that feeds on the hypothalamuses hypothalamii of humans and animals goes on killing spree in chicago museum how did this creature come into existence and why does it feed on hormones the scientific explanation cooked up by the four yes four credited screenwriters amy holden jones john raffo rick jaffa and amanda silver takes suspension of disbelief to new heights even by monster movie standards but as cockamamie as the science is in the film it isn quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears give it up penelope it _monster_movie_ on the flip side tom sizemore just phones in his performance as police lieutenant but his role is so thankless that it hard to imagine it being played any more effectively it quite funny to see film indulge with the straightest of faces in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well and so recently in scream for example in one early scene museum security guard goes into bathroom stall late at night ok we all know what coming but as if we didn need any more confirmation he pulls out joint and starts puffing away everyone knows what happens to people who do drugs in scary movie and later miller frantically runs out of museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing does she make beeline for the front door of course not she runs into the ladies room and cowers in stall with all the cliches it is only fitting the film climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film that of someone outrunning fireball if the relic is truly the next evolution in terror as the poster states then the horror film and humanity is in even worse shape than we thought
you damn dirty apes that just one of the inadvertenty hilarious lines from planet of the apes that taken on comedic context over time no one back then seemed to realize how over the top charlton heston acting style was but it shows now particularly in this mystery science theater 3000 wannabe that was taken for film masterpiece in its time actually winning one oscar for makeup no less and being nominated for couple others it also spawned multiple sequels like beneath the planet of the apes escape from the planet of the apes return of the planet of the apes beneath the escape from the return of the planet of the apes planet of the apes the next generation police academy of the apes the list goes on heston is an american astronaut who spends few thousand light years in space with his three companions and ends up on planet not too dissimilar from earth the thing is on this planet humans can talk or think and the guys in the gorilla masks are the dominant species heston companions are killed or turned into vegetables by the apon is imprisoned he surprises them all with his gift of speech making two primate scientists roddy mcdowall and kim hunter believe heston is the missing link between ape and man believe me we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for years when the two apes present the idea before judicial counsel the head ape being shakespearean actor maurice evans it is received as heresy for all good monkeys know god created ape in his image but heston has already seen cave that contains evidence that humans were originally the dominant species before apes ever gained the ability to speak and run for president and he takes them there holding up baby doll and yelling if humans couldn speak then how do you account for this talking doll and how do you account for your acting ability mr heston the absolute most laughable scene comes with the movie surprise conclusion won reveal the details except to say it involves heston falling to his knees on beach and yelling god damn you all to hell several times in succession the movie is atrocious and should only be viewed by those members of society who like to watch bad movies and laugh at them what makes planet of the apes even more amusing is that it was supposed to function as some sort of social irony condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution but let me tell you if darwin could see the ape masks and hear the rotten dialogue exchanges heston [to female ape] may kiss you before go ape but you re so ugly he convert to creationism on the spot luckily for us science fiction movies have evolved over time to the point at which some of them are actually good
senseless is prime example of what can happen when you try to push one joke concept bit too far director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon college senior vying for lucrative job at prominent brokerage however he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition scott thorpe david spade in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep an athletic record sponsorship by fraternity and most of all wealthy family to back him up in fact darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet but there may be light at the end of that tunnel he signs up as human guinea pig in neurological experiment run by the university dr wheedon brad dourif as result his senses are magnified tenfold using his newfound abilities he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side effects to having super senses naturally marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle giving jim carrey ish amounts of physical humor the problem is aside from few genuinely inspired bits there not much that funny here the film has it one central gag and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor there obviously wasn much thought put into the plot the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous mean why the emphasis on extra curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to single elimination quiz anyhow and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester to give it credit senseless does try to create secondary joke with darryl roommate tim laflour matthew lillard apparently he is supposed to be faddish but the film never does anything with him leaving him in piercing phase throughout the movie his intervention scenes with darryl however do provide rare and welcome laugh and then there the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one in this case the object of darryl amor is janice tamara taylor fellow student who won have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super senses needless to say the romance is completely extraneous and adds little to the film this is film that desperately needed something else be that good plot more jokes or simply funnier ones or strong character or two anything would have helped senseless get off the ground as it is all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can help marlon wayans get this one off the ground

the beach is structurally confusing film that can only describe has having multiple personality disorder every forty minutes of this two hour film begins with new theme virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act it starts off purposefully as film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in dangerous environment but then in the second act the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes story about love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of mavi lagoon forty minutes later the mood changes once more and it becomes dumbed down version of lord of the flies where an isolated community is discovered where their moral code touts maintaining sense of bliss at all costs by the time it over you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about the main character of the beach is angst ridden richard leonardo dicaprio he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you re looking for good time richard voice over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into world of the unknown this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for he checks into fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy robert carlisle he seems like raving lunatic obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis though his jagged behavior would distress most of us richard listens to him as he speaks of mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen moreover the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make small city high for life captivated by the idea he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richard once they finally arrive at this paradise however the mood of the story shifts to richard growing desire for francoise this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard etienne is about as exciting as fluffy beyaz sand it odd that etienne never sees this coming but paradise has way of hiding potential threats just out of view and once the three stumble across the hidden community mood shift imminent more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers for example there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards and the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark there are several ideas that are introduced in the beach and each one could merit its own feature length film there the man vs nature angle the love triangle angle and the utopia gone awry angle but the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred dicaprio as result has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through consequently the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up
after 1993 falling down hoped that joel schumacher would mature into great director since then he has offered us two so so adaptations of john grisham novels the client and time to kill and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise although these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher potential the publicity for his latest release 8mm raised new hope it promised to be something unusual it wasn the plot goes like this tom welles nicolas cage is private eye who is hired by wealthy woman allegorically named mrs christian myra carter to investigate an 8mm movie found among her late husband belongings the movie appears to be snuff film in which teenage girl is raped and murdered by man in leather mask who reminds me of bane in schumacher batman robin because murders can be realistically simulated in movies mrs christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead by combing through missing persons reports tom finds the girl name and tracks her to los angeles with the aid of max california joaquin phoenix video store clerk and another symbolic name tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff the plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schrader hardcore in which father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter both films are modeled on dante the inferno of course 8mm makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward meeting with the devil hardcore is much more subtle and meaningful film 8mm had lot of promise in its better moments it an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even nice guy like tom one moment of the first sort when we first meet max he reading truman capote in cold blood underneath the cover of porn novel in cold blood was the father of the true crime genre which is the literary equivalent of snuff films max promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom dance with the devil and the devil don change the devil changes you tom does change ll let you discover the specifics for yourself but not permanently schumacher and screenwriter andrew kevin walker didn have the guts to take tom so far down the dark tunnel that he couldn come back walker seven did much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise cage tries hard to pull it off but the script doesn give him enough to work with phoenix walks away with the movie he smart charming and funny other cast members include fargo peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet and the sopranos james gandolfini as soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far in the last analysis since 8mm falls short of its pretensions and its promise its just another private eye story in the raymond chandler ross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege however unlike other predictable fare in the genre last year twilight for example 8mm is especially disappointing because it could have been much more than it is
do the folks at disney have no common decency they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects embarrassing writing and kid friendly slapstick wasn mr magoo enough people obviously not inspector gadget is not what would call ideal family entertainment younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness but their adult companions may feel wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80 minute exercise in glaring stupidity the movie is poorly edited grossly manipulative and the finished product resembles somewhat of failed jigsaw puzzle all the elements are there but the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite as huge fan of the 80 animated tv show the first thing must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain in the cartoon dr claw was frightening raspy voiced presence who remained total mystery to the viewer we never saw his face he simply sat back in his arm chair watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat as child always imagined what dr claw would appear as and this curiosity kept me watching for many years with the release of the live action movie the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed it rupert everett only now dr claw is simply known as claw `one word he explains `like madonna he sports shiny clamp instead of the steel glove and seems far less interesting than the animated version it helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic but he overplays the role entirely too far when all is said and done this wasn very wise move on the part of the screenwriters the infamous dr claw has been turned into wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool he does still have his cat though in the title role matthew broderick looks lost the actor while usually downright charming doesn know exactly where to take his character fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers broderick first plays friendly naive security guard named john brown who dreams of becoming cop and upholding the law for the good of the people he has mad crush on pretty scientist brenda joely fisher who has stumbled upon new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics but one fateful night her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen by fiendish millionaire everett who wants to take over the world john courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames in full body cast he is chosen to be the first human prototype for brenda work revolutionary crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys and so is born inspector gadget as bad as this movie is it does have certain charm in isolated scenes broderick actually fares better playing robo gadget an evil and destructive clone that claw has set loose on the city and there are about two or three amusing punch lines the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates rampaging monster with shadow puppets on brick wall and japanese man flees the scene while screaming `this is why left tokyo alas the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to in favor of not even cracking slight giggle there are so many tired plot additions gadget talking car voiced by hughley is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian both are wisecracking non human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children well it just doesn work in fact zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this and don even get me started about the villains didn mind everett performance but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust the characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles penny michelle trachtenberg and brain the dog now have little to do with the action and chief quimby dabney coleman has lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action the special effects are everywhere but not so annoying they will cause your eyes to peel over the problem here lies solely in the script perhaps the next time disney attempts remake like this they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancy schmancy visuals here is one critic crossing his fingers anyway
battlefield earth is the best comedy of the year it has to be the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider bad movie syndrome struck me again so after witnessing how much battlefield earth has been proclaimed train wreck in both critical and popular circles felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first hand is it as bad as advertised oh yes very much so the plot is incomprehensible the acting is atrocious the special effects are mediocre the action is dull the implausibilities are legion the dialogue is cringe inducing the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny don even want to continue reviewing this movie like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory so here it is the premise is basically rip off of planet of the apes only minus the apes and philosophical discussion and plus race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo the year is 3000 the psychlos have conquered earth and the human population has been enslaved only handful of humans escaped to radiation rich areas to escape the aliens they live out their lives in fear one man johnny goodboy know know tyler barry pepper ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos there he confronts the psychlo head of security big ugly klingon looking creature called terl john travolta pressed into slavery johnny vows to lead revolution and take the planet back meanwhile terl is faced with his own problems he has recently learned that he stuck living on earth which he hates for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man daughter he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology this is where the plot gets ridiculous so the man animal can lead mining expedition into places the psychlos can go terl then plans to keep the mined altin for himself of course his plan doesn work so many things wrong with this movie where to begin how about with travolta whose hollywood clout brought about this the cinematic version of scientology guru ron hubbard sci fi novel early previews for battlefield earth with constant shots of makeup laden travolta cackling like lex luthor had me and several audience members remarking what the hell is travolta thinking the movie did nothing to stem such remarks all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here terl cackles after nearly every line and so does every other psychlo of course this makes every scene hilariously overwrought no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america but ceos generally don laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees you were going to be promoted but now you re not fwahahahahahahahaha it no big surprise terl loses to the humans he an idiot he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book he underestimates his enemies assuming he ll win just because he smarter he uses the word leverage like some sort of scientologist mantra not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero he hooks him up to machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos language and technology why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me he then appears shocked that johnny points gun at him no wonder this guy never got his promotion the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for altin when the doors of fort knox are wide open how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in hangar for 000 years and how do all these previously brain dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly there whole lot more to scratch one head about in battlefield earth bring scorecard to track the plot holes director roger christian shoots battlefield earth in the most distracting way possible tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason all the characters appear to be standing on the walls and it awfully difficult to watch movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue the action sequences are atrociously edited every one turned into an endless slow motion parade that drains all potential excitement are these things really so hard to construct my respect for supposed lightweight action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in battlefield earth how badly an action sequence can be shot this movie is an absolute headache it not just the shot selection and editing the movie quite frankly makes no sense for most of battlefield earth running time just didn know what was happening it didn have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical though they certainly are really had no idea what the hell was going on when pieced the plot together later it didn look any better here how much of disaster this is battlefield earth is already the worst movie of the year and it going to take something really really inept to top it the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it in fact think that hubbard cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible that ll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again
in this year summer movie preview issue of _entertainment_weekly_ theresa connelly described her writing directing debut _polish_wedding_ as child that did not quite become the child thought it would one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film comedy drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements the family at the center of _polish_wedding_ is the pzoniaks which consists of mother jadzia lena olin father bolek gabriel byrne sole daughter hala claire danes and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness it large family but there not sympathetic one in the whole bunch certainly not in the primary trio jadzia takes pride in building and maintaining home and family but she kind of hypocrite since she carrying on an affair with businessman rade serbedzija her excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek who is such passive wimp that one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration also how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy sexy jadzia hala is spoiled self centered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy with such an unappealing set of characters it no surprise that _polish_wedding_ plot complications are far from involving naturally jadzia and bolek would like hala to marry the young cop russell schuster adam trese who fathered the child but he refuses to make such commitment ho hum another complication involving the decidedly un virginal hala being selected to crown statue of the virgin mary is first played for laughs and then inexplicably as profound statement in the film climax which ironically is funnier than any of the film lame attempts at humor such as painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in charge to beat up russell that scene is but one in number of writing miscues by connelly the jadzia bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers the hala russell conflict isn resolved in as contrived manner but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something and then there some atrocious dialogue which am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound look at all these pickles just looking at them gives me such great sadness as misguided as _polish_wedding_ is the affair is something of letdown considering the strong performances by byrne danes and especially the fiery olin they obviously believed in connelly and her material faith that audiences will be hard pressed to share
vampires starts out almost in the style of spaghetti western with an attack on small homestead in new mexico the house has nest of vampires and jack crow james woods is leading team of vampire hunters in to clean them out while the initial imagery is little over dramatic it gives way to what is fairly decent action sequence that is enough action to last us while and we could director john carpenter would let us get to story line but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene then there is only bit more of plot before the next action scene after that the plot is kept to minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end and that is something of pity because the film based on the book vampire$ by john steakley gives us myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it what carpenter saves his serious screen time for sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires there is lot of fighting and lots of gore anything intriguing is kept to minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans this has not always been carpenter style his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do little thinking about the film central science fictional question jack crow heads vampire swat team cleaning up nests of vampires with high tech spears and crossbows in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by particularly mean vampire valek thomas ian griffith who has been tipped off to who crow is now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya daniel baldwin to make matters worse he does not know the people on his own side tony and his backers he can trust meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico if this is sounding like very tired police corruption plot with few obvious substitutions that exactly what it is the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for gang of hood who are themselves looking for packet of heroin but carpenter goes against familiar principle of film show people don tell them just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding why are the vampires in new mexico what do they want and why do they want it what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church how did crow come to be vampire hunter and why devote his life to it the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized but instead are revealed through dialog now if all this was not bad enough carpenter misuses the james wood persona woods plays particular sort of cool lowlife very well but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio leone style mythic posturing while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target woods does not work as larger than life mythic hero that is not his style and it just does not work very well there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses in one scene we are looking at motel room with dead people on the floor one female corpse is on the floor in front of chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret these vampires do not maintain low profile there are arguably logical flaws in the film there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has dramatic effect on vampires yet in scene toward the end vampire can walk under burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out while might recommend this film to an action audience would say that what look for in vampire film vampires rates on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale perhaps will read the book
if you re going to make two hour hollywood in joke why bother releasing it to the general public if you re going to create film that will appeal primarily to big name actors and people who know woody allen then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters while watching celebrity realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating story about real people what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self deprecation celebrity is yet another film in which allen tells story about himself living in world that he familiar with dealing with people like the ones he actually knows allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more branagh plays lee simon journalist turned screenwriter who divorces his wife robin judy davis shacks up with some hot women famke janssen charlize theron winona ryder and goes about trying to get big stars melanie griffith leonardo dicaprio to read his script about an armored car robbery the usual elements of recent allen films are all here including the sexual insecurity of the main character lots of self loathing women and tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another unless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally it not likely that you ll find whole lot of interest in celebrity aside from all the in jokes the story falls far short of compelling and the characters are all empty and lifeless branagh proves once again that he superb performer nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly the problem is that he the same character allen always plays character who getting more than little dull to watch mean come on how many times have you seen this guy he hates his work and he can be satisfied by any one woman and at the end of the movie nothing has been solved he brings all of his problems upon himself crashing his car because he receiving fellatio and other such stunts so it pretty hard to care about him in addition isn allen capable of creating characters who aren just like him know he is but he didn do it in celebrity the vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances davis playing the same woman with low self esteem that she played in deconstructing harry has few touching moments but ends up the same despicable celebrity type that fills the rest of the movie some of the actresses are saved because of their beauty theron and ryder especially but they re not likable people only famke janssen as book editor interested in simon new novel has any life the men in the picture don do much better joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin while dicaprio as christian slater johnny depp type spoiled young actor is funny but disengaging what really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its themes are allen seems to think that he making an insightful movie about the way normal people look at celebrities the main problem with this is that the character with whom we re supposed to identify simon is not normal guy he just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters the other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us none of them register as realistic interesting characters they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue in addition allen decides he needs scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly robin in this scene says something like it interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate celebrity is arguably allen biggest misfire to date it does have few good scenes theron super orgasmic model character is kind of funny and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us character or two but celebrity is failure at the core unless allen point was to make self indulgent movie about himself and his friends if he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of big joke then he succeeded in that for one don enjoy feeling like an outsider
heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in couple of interviews and in both instances he felt the strange compulsion to compare it little series of films called lethal weapon now personally remember those films as starring major motion picture star being funny having great action sequences great chemistry decent character development hmmm okay now on to my review of chill factor plot graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto malicious plan by an ex army general to propose nuclear device to international prospects when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps they must keep it cool on ice and rush it over to an army base before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit and kills millions of people critique speed on an ice cream truck is probably the pitch that was used to sell this one tone movie to its backers but unfortunately the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tension filled original two hours of cinema is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film and the lethal weapon movies stood for this film is seasoned in cliches with plenty of badly written dialogue over the top acting from cuba gooding jr zero chemistry between the two leads and horribly tacky bad guys tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe my friend and enjoyed watching this movie to certain extent because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously written that we just had to crack up that and the formula for the film script which followed the proverbial and you guessed it scenario and what about all those catchy hip names to get us to relate to the characters elvis and nighshift oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters and yes it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr got involved in this one week old blue cheese smelling project did they actually think that it would boost their careers or did they know that the script sucked but discounted any fall from grace knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall most probably the latter have you seen either fled or bulletproof well despite the slight differences in plot the essentials are basically the same here you get siyah guy and beyaz guy being chased by bunch of people having no choice but to work together to get somewhere hating each other at first but over time learning to respect one another as individuals yawn add to that the fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in siyah drive siyah cars and siyah vans and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head not too conspicuous eh call me party pooper but as much as like nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy this film just doesn even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining one cool scene with boat careening down mountainside and another with nuclear device obliterating everything on an island do not fun buddy action flick make show cuba the money everybody little known facts about this film and its stars this is not little known fact or anything but damn is it just me or does skeet ulrich look an awful lot like great looking actor johnny depp skeet real life nicknames include chester skeeter and mosquito he stands was born in north carolina and got married in 1997 to that sex kitten actress from clay pigeons 10 georgina cates they own farm together in virginia and seven dogs skeet has long scar on his chest from open heart surgery done when he was 10 to correct ventricle defect actor cuba gooding jr was born in the bronx new york in 1984 he break danced during the closing ceremonies of the olympic games in los angeles he stands 10 actress hudson leick who plays one of the bad guys girls in his movie is better known from her role as callisto on the popular tv series xena princess warrior this film reportedly had budget of $40 million not exactly sure where all this money went but it certainly did not register onscreen interestingly enough director hugh johnson who makes his big screen debut with this film was the cinematographer on the 1996 film beyaz squall and the 1997 demi moore vehicle jane 10
sometimes wonder just what the censors are thinking take this film naked killer among it ingredients are heavy doses of violence rape sequences straight and lesbian sex scenes and what our system calls coarse language but what do those intelligent people at the censorship bureau choose to remove in case someone will get offended one word penis that it in spite of everything else in the movie the one thing that the censors decide is too much is penis it really restores you re faith in the system huh anyway that just side point when naked killer was released in the local independent cinemas around melbourne it was advertised ad nausuem as hip cool controversial thriller what they forgot to mention was that it isn very good the plot involves male cop tinam simon yam investigating series of brutal murders while getting haircut he meets and finds himself attracted to girl named kitty chingmy yau who after extracting revenge on the man who killed her father falls in with professional killer sister cindy svenwara madoka realising kitty has potential cindy decides to train kitty in several unusual and ridiculous ways and gives her new identity however in the course of his investigation tinam who believed kitty had disappeared runs into her again but isn quite sure if it her to complicate matters the actual serial killlers princess and baby who former students of cindy and have been told to kill their old master and her new student from then the action ensues all in all this is not well done movie the script is awful the direction all over the place the editing is jerky and confusing and the subtitling is surprisingly poor however the are few stand alone pieces that do entertain the shoot out in the car park is almost woo like in adrenaline the fight scenes are energetic and guess it must get few points for trying something little different let me put this way if you like action get something else if you like strong women in movies get something else if you have do decide between this and siyah cat for your hong kong female action don get either even for curiosity value it just isn worth it let face it if ever the was movie that became popular on it subject alone this is it
after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy was ready for some mindless fun oh maybe something like tango cash maybe not mindless fun is one thing but brain dead slop is another matter altogether tango cash has lowest common denominator written all over it the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in russell plays cash reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts stallone plays tango wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it he doesn need the money in an effort to change his image stallone goes for yuppie gq look in the film wearing spectacles and three piece suits the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names tango cash is unbearably noisy for starters there harold faltermeyer annoying synthesized score which gets old after four notes to make matters worse the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars the more the merrier in fact the movie begins with not one but two car chases there nothing like good old car chase to introduce the characters in movie screenwriter randy feldman brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it such as stallone efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual in movie with the iq level of an amoeba even great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent and stallone is no lawrence olivier it hard to imagine anyone reading feldman script and thinking want to be in this movie the film plot doesn have one original bone in its body and again you have to point your finger at the screenwriting feldman story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book making tango cash altogether generic and predictable they simply could have called it action movie every character every twist and turn is stolen from television or from other movies adding insult to injury tango cash is about as believable as road runner cartoon action movies don have to be realistic but they should absorb you enough so that you re not thinking about the lack of realism the only artistic aspect of tango cash is the cinematography there are some spectacular shots especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires the film main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell unfortunately their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants the dialogue consists of nothing but one liners and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing it shame because with workable screenplay russell and stallone could have turned tango cash into charming lethal weaponesque adventure tango cash tries to maintain light tone and you do laugh about once every five minutes seeing russell in drag is the movie funniest moment but you probably already have seen it in the commercials furthermore the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence machine guns and torture generally don mix well with comedy jack palance appears in tango cash doing what he does best playing sleazy conniving villain his character however is run of the mill except for his strange obsession with mice like many movie villains palance likes to play games in fact he sets ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room you have to wonder why palance doesn just shoot the detectives in the head the story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent teri hatcher plays stallone sister and russell love interest and she is just as pretty as can be but regrettably hatcher acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty every time she opens her mouth you cringe corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always fatal combination there really very little if anything to recommend in the film and more to the point tango definitely isn worth penny of your cash so don bother
and thought stigmata would be the worst religiously oriented thriller released this year turns out was wrong because while stigmata was merely boring and self important end of days is completely inept on all fronts it silly incomprehensible endlessly stupid mess for guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best it extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up for the first time in recent memory an arnold action movie and batman robin doesn count is no fun at all end of days is major stinker the movie opens in vatican city 1979 some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy which says that girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 1999 the world will be destroyed the pope orders protection of this girl though some priests believe she ought to be killed in new york that very night girl is born to fulfill the prophecy twenty years later we meet jericho cane schwarzenegger suicidal ex cop with drinking problem now working as security guard for hire he is protecting local businessman gabriel byrne who is actually possessed by the devil an assassination attempt on the businessman by crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after christine york robin tunney recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine including ownership of the same music box apparently jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her there are so many problems with this film it hard to know where to begin but how about starting with the concept casting arnold in role like this was mistake to begin with schwarzenegger is persona not an actor so putting him in role that contradicts his usual strong personality is bad idea arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off character tormented by conflicting emotions in other words trying to give him dimension was mistake harrison ford mel gibson or even bruce willis could have played this role they ve all played noble and flawed heroes but not schwarzenegger there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho character one has him contemplating suicide another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine location by offering him his old life back none of these scenes really work because arnie isn up to the task the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho strong confident character like the terminator for example the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before this one isn at all believable the way arnold plays him the supporting cast tries their hardest and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all as the prince of darkness he suave and confident he acts like one would expect the devil to act the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense more on that later and that undermines him as powerful villain byrne out performs arnold in every scene they have together including the aforementioned temptation bit but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable root for the devil byrne speech about the bible being overrated actually starts to make sense mainly because arnold attempts at refuting it mostly of the tis not variety are feeble at best the only problem is arnold has to win so in the end nobody really cares kevin pollack plays jericho security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides but like most bad action movie sidekicks he disappears after about an hour robin tunney isn given much to do except look scared in fact all of the supporting players are good actors but none save for byrne is given anything interesting to do performances aside it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it this being an action blockbuster it no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script which starts off totally confusing and when some of it is explained and not much of it is it utterly ridiculous why is the devil coming on new year eve 1999 because it exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil which isn 666 it turns out some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down so the real year is 999 so just add to the beginning and you ve got 1999 if you don buy this explanation you re not alone it convoluted and silly at the same time the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous she christine see and she lives in new york see and if that weren bad enough there plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn explained at all why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex cop he powerless is he impervious to only one kind of bullet how come he can control jericho or christine and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies clumsy attempt at joke is made about this but it never actually explained usually this sort of thing wouldn matter in schwarzenegger flick mean don get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting there are several predictable horror film clich present in end of days complete with the old siyah cat hiding in cabinet bit not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there it gets so formulaic that it possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment boo will come their predictions will rarely be wrong the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless partially because we don care about these characters due to the script pathetic attempts at characterization and setup and also because they too don make any sense there scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around room by little old lady it good for few chuckles but not much else supposedly we re to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan but the script never sets that up so the scene is merely silly none of this is terribly exciting because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it often hard to tell why it happening in the first place not to mention that they re edited in full on incomprehensible mtv quick cut style most of them had me scratching my head rather than saying wow cool end of days is not only silly and confusing but it also distinctly unpleasant to watch the devil apparently doesn operate in the more subtle ll convince people to kill each other fashion outlined in the bible but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight this doesn only make him an awfully predictable sort but it also means that not single scene in end of days goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence or the odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit that had me scratching my head if violence is supposed to be shocking it not good idea to throw so much of it into movie that the audience goes numb scenes aren connected through any reasonable means so lot of the time stuff gets blown up or people get killed and had no idea why reasons to hell with reasons let just blow stuff up isn it cool nope not by long shot this film is thoroughly unwatchable it dull interminable and unrelenting in its stupidity perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career because it not happening with hack peter hyams here end of days might have had camp value if only it didn top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody going to buy if the movie is going to be serious the filmmakers should have come up with decent script if it going to be campy arnold shouldn be taking himself so damn seriously didn actually see him put up on cross did and his character shouldn be such sad sack as it stands end of days is just bad movie and an awfully gloomy one at that
don get me wrong tend to appreciate besson naive unashamedly romantic worldview an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and young natalie portman and 1997 the fifth element is goofy paean to love that even more of hoot on repeated viewings but his joan of arc is mess despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of close cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself jovovich besson own personal muse through the making of his last two films though they ve since separated is magnetic and energetic enough to play credible joan as long as you believe joan was not just warrior but also fabulous supermodel level babe and besson remains servicable action film director though not an especially facile one leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english joan struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring and besson helps you understand how the french could believe fervently that god is on her side besson big mistake think is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject yes joan had visions but guarantee that whatever image sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue eyed christ figure on display in besson hallucinatory dream sequences the whole conceit turns into disaster right about the time dustin hoffman billed as the conscience shows up spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell babbling like ally mcbeal that kind of shame since she does quite well up to that point charging into battle with banshee wail that suggests the eruption of sublimated bloodthirstiness that darkly attractive aspect of her character that she as likely charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord is more or less betrayed by the final reels in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing she overseen and joan starts to look like little more than very confused young lady who about to take fall as the story winds down with joan condemned to horrible death by fire besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance trouble is he chosen lurid often jokey tone for the balance of the picture including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes and it impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is to great extent nothing more than put on this glib pre fab version of such great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer the passion of joan of arc 1928 film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan trial and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema compared to that film the messenger plays as crime against history directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich france usa 1999 theatrical aspect ratio 35
paul verhoeven the dutch auteur who dragged his violent sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film has never been what consider thoughtful director though some of his films notably starship troopers have been lauded as artistic achievements but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who managed to no matter what the budget make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils starship troopers was essentially monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange great film that nearly impossible to find on video yet showgirls is everywhere in which he cast troop of stunningly attractive mannequins the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards who may actually be 45% silicone in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage it not completely successful film but as failure it certainly an interesting and mostly entertaining one my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores spetters dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange haven yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight believe his best hollywood film to be robocop bleak super hero satire with robotic hero that as touching as schwarzenegger in t2 that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics its violence seemed to be there for purpose namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience there jaw dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with cop before snuffing him he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim every fearful tic it startling moment of barbaric maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk noir in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays dog because it just won shut up he impales co worker drowns another and so on but why his character is introduced as smug genius the kind who always impeccably dressed and races sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear sort of like scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place though once the character becomes invisible this film has him pull 180 shift into psychotic movie monster the kind who just won die hollow man protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda elizabeth shue acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm and her lover hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who saddled with the film worst lines ve lost cohesion again they re typical aaron spelling couple good looking but as vacant as george bush republican national convention speech bush referring to clinton so much promise but to what end to what end this actually got applause suddenly warren beatty doesn look so absurd the rest of the film characters are all well past thirty though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with series of strained one liners is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood new character developing technique ahh what cynical time we live in as the picture opens we meet cain kevin bacon an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on top secret so top secret the government has only provided them with dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation project with the goal to make invisibility possibility for what purpose is never hinted at they ve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine in twist worthy of the film 1950 late show origins to impulsively experiment on himself caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead our mad scientist is turned invisible after several fx heavy complications then he inexplicably it hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures but this is never explored and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on human begins raping assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases always with lame wisecrack ready la freddy krueger it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it verhoeven films that have become hollow like the rest this one is cold heartless and full of contempt for humanity but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit insight and makes no statement other than audiences will pay for anything these days it an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level or even those hoping to spend saturday night with fun thrill minute ride verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick how can one not have good time at film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self couple weeks ago after seeing the trailer bunch of friends and got into long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa in serious manner to boot but oh yeah it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway verhoeven delivers the sleazy goods but not in watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner here it just feels icky and uncomfortable the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux psycho music strains in the background it plainly obvious that verhoeven isn exploring voyeurism like in the classic peeping tom but exploiting it and not even doing that very well it funny that with all the technology $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show woman naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks in fact it largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since by the end most of his potential victims don infer red glasses that track his body heat as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked the film only provides one moment that found genuinely creepy it happens when lab assistant kim dickens who looks like she stepped out of playboy in the middle of chit chat with an invisible bacon suddenly pauses are you looking at me she queries obviously haunted it little moment in big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to plot that should have run its course by 1982 the apex of the mad slasher craze those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or still know what you did last summer and they re the only reason to check out hollow man preferably as mid week bargain rental you ve been warned but you probably won listen will you tis pity

days in the valley is more or less pulp fiction knock off it basically involves how bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways not going into much greater detail than that since it would take forever to explain and quite frankly not willing to spend any more time on it than the hours that ve already wasted while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction days in the valley falls way short this is quite condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello james spader and jeff daniels while the story isn much and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better days in the valley does have couple of bright spots james spader character while not much better than the rest is at least fun to watch in sick sort of way and we do get to see nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron in her first role you know movie isn that good when the highlight is brawl between two women even if they are both gorgeous will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted but marveling at that ingenuity is far cry from actually enjoying the result while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that really cared absolutely nothing about if were to put number on it only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch this is the sort of movie that only huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent and even then prepare for disappointment not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again or at least not all of it anyway
it good thing most animated sci fi movies come from japan because titan is proof that hollywood doesn have clue how to do it don know what this film is supposed to be about from what can tell it about young man named kale who one of the last survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and re generating what is left of the human race that fine premise for an action packed sci fi animated movie but there no payoff the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for legendary ship that the evil dredge aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason so in the process we get lot of spaceship fights fistfights blaster fights and more double crosses than you can shake stick at there so much pointless sci fi banter it too much to take the galaxy here is total rip off of the star wars universe the creators don bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring despite the fantastic animation and special effects it just not an interesting movie
all right all right we get the point despite all similarities to the best selling story speechless is not based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin in fact the script was in development well before 1992 still the comparisons are inevitable until one realizes critical difference no it not that the speechless twosome are speech writers not campaign managers it that carville and matalin story is actually interesting speechless is limp poorly structured would be romantic comedy speechless is set during new mexico senatorial campaign where kevin vallick michael keaton and julia mann geena davis meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign kevin is sit com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate speeches while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship but eventually they let down their guard and become closer but there are plent of obstacles in the way including julia stud reporter fiance christopher reeve and series of stunts which continue to prove that all fair in love and politics the standard formula for movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they re crazy about each other screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each other arms in the first fifteen minutes then developing the antagonism it noble attempt to shake things up but unfortunately it just doesn work part of the fun of watching sparring in romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do but in speechless they already know they re attracted to each other and we re left with waiting for the campaign to end so they ll admit that they love each other already there is such herky jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king sharp dialogue can prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton and with those performances most of their scenes together the problems begin with their initial courtship which does virtually nothing to establish julia character and merely establishes that kevin is wise ass davis is radiantly beautiful and keaton is generally entertaining but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit in couple of scenes like quiet moment sitting at fountain they actually achieve some measure of connection for the most part however they re just actors spouting lines you keep waiting for little spark and it never happens perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless politics the setting seems perfect for high energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix but that never the tone that underwood is going for he wants warm fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman flute and wind musical score and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background it might as well have been story about rival grocers and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king previous screenplay the dana carvey flop clean slate so had some hopes for speechless but while there is wit in the words this is script which was probably much better on paper on screen it still paper thin
walken stars as mobster who is kidnapped and held for ransom by four bratty rich kids it seems that woman has also been kidnapped she is the sister of one of them henry thomas and the girlfriend of another flannery and the asking price is $2 million which said snots are unable to cough up alone they even cut off walken finger to show they mean business because they are desperate to save the woman life suicide kings is terrible film walken aside there isn single appealing cast member fallon creates characters that are functional types without any resonance in an amusingly unironic scene walken plays poker with the foursome and describes each of their personalities to tee it as if he was reading the summary sheet for casting director the plot is another issue entirely fallon is someone whom betting has seen reservoir dogs and the usual suspects too many times for not only does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence they never return do we really need the scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father with toaster which is entirely unrelated to both the story and leary character or the numerous anecdotal sequences but the central plot itself is serpentine mess filled with crosses and double crosses and triple crosses by the fourth big revelation twist had completely tuned out wondering what on earth attracted these actors to the material recently peer fellow young filmmaker informed me that he had an idea for movie about four guys the mob and the fbi it occurred to me then what wrong with indies like suicide kings suspect fallon has never met mobster is not rich man doesn deliver endless clever monologues to his friends about his favourite types of boots in short these guys are just riffing on other movies and in doing that making the same film over and over and over again tarantino found his niche and now hundreds of genxers with movie cameras are trying to find tarantino niche instead of carving their own reviewed at the toronto international film festival
stallone attempts to act in this cop drama the film is set in neighbourhood pratically built by kietal who nephew played by michael rappaport is involved in car crash and killing of two siyah youths keital dosen really want to get involved in anything gets rid of rappaport and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on this film should be brilliant it sounds like great plot the actors are first grade and the supporting cast is good aswell and stallone is attempting to deliver good performance however it can hold up although the acting is fantastic even stallone isn bad the directing and story is dull and long winded some scenes go on for too long with nothing really happening in them in fact the only scenes that do work are action scenes which suspect stallone was trying to avoid in this film serious means dull the dialogue is warbling and basically just repeats the same points over and over no matter who is delivering them the plot which has potential is wasted again just being cliched after while in fact the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro both delivering their usual good performances however stallone although not given much to say gives good performance however it not all that bad as said above the action scenes are well done theres also very good ending which uses the cinemas sound system well in fact the last 10 minutes of this hour film are one of the best endings of 1997 if only the rest of the film was as good as the ending cop land then turns out not to be power house film but rather dull and not every exciting film hugely disappointing and can really recommend it
birthdays often cause individuals to access their lives are we doing what we want to be doing what happened to our dreams with the new millennium our collective big birthday just around the corner some people are sensing certain dissatisfaction with their existence the old standbys of traditional religion and science aren doing it for many anymore and they re looking for something else we ll be seeing more and more films with metaphysical theme over the next few years ricky hayman jeff goldblum is having career crisis the programming director for the good buy home shopping network he going to be fired unless sales increase dramatically new producer kate newell kelly preston is supposed to whip things into shape when the two are fixing flat they almost run down new age pilgrim murphy wanders onto the television set and connects with the viewers by telling them that they don really want all that commercial crap in some unexplained manner this causes sales to sour ricky is saved the movie tries to be too much at once and fails at it all it not an over the top comedy or heart warming message of humanity it _is_ mish mosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog am willing to put up with preaching from film but the messages here are old hat you should take time to smell the roses selling your soul for cash is bad idea golly glad saw the movie never would have thought of these the opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed when takes chainsaw to the set there an obvious chance for murphy to be hilarious it doesn happen the bits are so subdued and overly long that there only hint of laughter from the audience murphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better there are hints of promise in this one the only time the film picks up even little is when his shaved headed character in the long flowing beyaz caftan shows up on screen the others are horrendous goldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career but here he seems to have been replaced with lifeless pod from his invasion of the body snatchers his relationship with kate makes no sense they move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen preston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be somewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value an attempt to satirize stupid television we get self parody instead
post chasing amy slew of love triangle movies this month we have kissing fool co starring amy own lee and april brings us the object of my affection which may as well be titled chasing allan for it is the story of woman who falls in love with her gay roommate to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon about it that film stars schwimmer friend jennifer aniston if only kevin smith could write them all schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max who falls in love with his best friend jay lee book editor samantha avital mere twenty four hours after meeting her they are soon engaged and max because of his own raging libido grows suspicious of samantha fidelity he convinces jay to flirt with samantha during the development of his book to test her the trouble is jay might be secretly in love with her to stretch this flat sitcom premise to feature length the plot is framed by climactic wedding at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular tale the events leading up to the nuptials to an annoying fat man and his silly girlfriend hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue and lee poor lee is miscast so hysterically funny in chasing amy here he is forced to repress his comic instincts to swear to yell to talk about oral sex the script idea of character trait is to stress that jay is sensitive man and then show him drinking pepto bismol when he stewing over his girl trouble as for avital an israeli actress she is warm and sweet but we don know anything about her character other than that it takes her an incredibly long time to realize the most obvious things she also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer who plays schwimmer assistant and personal temptress turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on vertigo there are handful smattering of good scenes in kissing fool enjoyed moment in comedy club during which jay gets up and asks has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wanted to kill her over and over until he booted off stage there are also few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything that on the page kissing fool is never as clever as the thursday night joke machine friends that spawned schwimmer movie career so save yourself eight dollars and watch three episodes of that series back to back
alcohol and drugs bad not alcohol and drugs good got it just when you though you ve seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen be that insanity or alcoholism hollywood releases yet another one of those deep emotional stories about finding yourself 28 days is practically visualization of the usual meaningful true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa meetings gwennie sandra bullock is young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol for her life was big party with no beginning and no end this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper dominic west borrowed her sister elizabeth perkins wedding limo and crashed it into someone house this time she had to pay with 28 day stay in court ordered rehab here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption willpower and commitment most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just big party the film itself feels like rehab program whining and moaning about things that have been said and written million times it is classic cautionary tale an echo big fat and expensive clich shadow of last year girl interrupted which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like the cuckoo nest and trainspotting director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film drama comedy jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues alienation despair terror confusion loneliness and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean isn that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place even the transition process itself seems like walk in the park betty thomas idea of hell is cozy homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke drink or watch tv after 11 it is simply too light simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story all you need to do is just say no says dr cornell steve buscemi as if was the revelation of the century and that how simple it is in fact would rather watch lost in space once again than return to 28 days as for acting it acceptable but hardly anything else for sandra bullock it an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than speed she handles her part with surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being complete flop dominic west shines as the source of gwenie devilish temptations but elizabeth perkins and steve buscemi great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters although intellectually girl interrupted was greater achievement 28 days is superior in its visual aspect there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor the most important thing is that we ve seen it before and it was lot better clean and sober only when laugh when man loves woman leaving las vegas and many other stronger films were made about the same issues so what the point in other words 28 days doesn contribute to the moviemaking business on any level if you re caught in snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you re standing in front of the movie theatre you might as well go in and watch 28 days under all other circumstances stay away because this film equals $8 and 103 minutes lost
godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the who cares about plot summer movie loose remake of the 1954 classic japanese monster movie godzilla king of the monsters which is itself pretty thin in the story department roland emmerich and dean devlin big budget lizard stomps manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind the script isn just dumbed down it lobotomized godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone presumably the primary target group for this film is teenage boys the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster instigated carnage that not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction they re just not as readily susceptible this is the third straight movie in row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that mastery of computer generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors stargate was financial success independence day was runaway hit and with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie ins before it even opens it virtually guaranteed at least $100 million nice numbers for film that could have been penned by not too precocious grade school kid godzilla isn completely without merit although it is close there certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan but it wears off quickly frankly while the special effects are competent they re not all that stunning there nothing new here it jurassic park meets aliens with little independence day thrown in for bad measure maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer generated visuals to the next level godzilla never really pushes the envelope preferring to remain within comfort zone the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by crass formulaic approach which disallows creativity how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival worst of all godzilla isn even exciting with the possible exception of mildly enjoyable car chase near the end there isn sequence in this film that raises the pulse even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn provoking independence day may have been dumb but it was full of adrenaline moments capable of getting the audience involved in the action in this aspect of its production as in so many others godzilla is lacking actually part of the problem is that we re never sure who we re supposed to be rooting for the green monster with an attitude or the paper thin humans trying to stop him the plot such as it is can be summed up rather simply after sinking few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands godzilla shows up in the big apple he does some of the usual tourist things stops by madison square garden visits the chrysler building goes on walk through central park and takes the subway in the process he knocks over few buildings and steps on countless cabs but he never has trouble with traffic jams on hand to stop him is an elite army unit led by slightly less arrogant than usual military man kevin dunn and biologist named nick tatopoulos who has theory about godzilla in his opinion the big guy is actually lizard grown to enormous proportions as result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific in nick words godzilla is mutated aberration an incipient creature the first of its kind as luck would have it nick old girlfriend audrey maria pitillo is reporter based at new york tv station along with her cameraman friend animal hank azaria she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla then just when the military has rejected nick theory about why godzilla is in new york member of the french secret service jean reno recruits him for special assignment instead of stomping around tokyo this time godzilla has chosen new york city unfortunately manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies independence day deep impact armageddon that it becoming boring the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall he could climb the empire state building at ten times that height godzilla would be more likely to knock it over godzilla contains few lame attempts at humor there an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit com material an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick last name properly and rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film ebert the mayor of new york is played by michael lerner and gene lorry goldman is his campaign manager ebert re election slogan is not surprisingly thumbs up for new york the siskel ebert stuff is amusing the first time it used but after while it grows tiresome and although the characters don serve any real purpose they keep popping up godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast this is largely because emmerich doesn want to risk human performance upstaging his lizard that not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren capable of good performances both have done their share of solid acting in the past but they aren list names then again considering the quality of the writing even pacino and deniro would have been hard pressed to shine maria pitillo dear god plays the love interest and hank azaria great expectations is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief ultimately it doesn really matter what or any other critic for that matter have to say about the movie tristar has assumed that godzilla like all self proclaimed summer event motion pictures is pretty much critic proof it may also be word of mouth proof those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what write or their friends say so when go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time it like spitting into the wind emmerich and devlin are master illusionists waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors it probably too much to hope that some day movie goers will wake up and realize that they ve been had
bicentennial man is family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment chris columbus the director who gave you mrs doubtfire plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point based on the short story by isaac asimov it is supposed to be science fiction story about robot who wants to be human which as you can imagine is very difficult starting in not too distant future the film concentrates on wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children soon this robot called andrew robin williams shows abilities that makes his owner mr martin sam neill very curious andrew is interested in art and music he enjoys making clocks which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions it shows out that because of small failure in the electrical circuits and positronic brain andrew has accidentally gained soul this makes him unique and his evil creators worried then mr martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn programmed to do soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom destiny and love this film can be described as disney version of blade runner film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction ever since that film the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy what makes us human the thoughts the emotions is it possible to become human at what point can we say to robot now you are one of us these are very tough questions that require serious and thurral approach it is obvious that columbus didn take them very seriously when you think about it this film is not really meditating on the question when is robot no longer machine but human being but tells story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as human being and only the society has troubles with it in other words it is as far from reality as from the academy awards further more there are other annoying problems to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now this has not been done for obvious reasons because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such difficult task columbus is the first to have crossed that line the result is as you might imagine primitive unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort the world is simply frozen in time neither the society fashion culture or values have changed over 200 years mom is still working at the kitchen doing the dishes when you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today you ll see slightly bigger difference am not saying that everything should change it is unlikely that the human rights will change but it even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science technology and fashion suppose it possible to watch this as some sort of bizarre fairytale but it really hard robin williams is hidden behind and speaking in robotic way as always he does decent job as does sam neill but it doesn really matter it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into tiresome experience pretty much like last year meet joe siyah this is primitive and unresolved story which is presented with splendor and professionalism that it doesn deserve great actors and talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten when isaac asimov wrote this story the future seemed far away and magical everything seemed possible now is the future of asimov time and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed long time ago for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne 20 000 leagues under the sea so can we accept this story as potential reality let us hope that next year will be more rewarding
long ago films were constructed of strong dialogue original characters memorable plot points and solid acting one of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is this opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic and mean tragic life of novalee nation natalie portman hitting the road with her hick guitar playing boyfriend in rusted out gm novalee dreams of the mavi skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath plastic umbrella with her unborn baby due in month stopping off at nearby wal mart for quick rest novalee boyfriend decides to take off and leaves her there novalee then decides to secretly hole up in the wal mart because she not the brightest bulb in the stagelights wacky librarian keith david comes to her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store then the she moves in with family befriends everyone in town including ashley judd character who has five kids and still can work part time as nurse fights off religious freaks survives tornado breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her receives an inheritance builds martha stewart esque house becomes an award winning photographer and manages to always look like she stepped out of cosmo shoot all while not once doing anything with her kid this film is terrible the directing is awful it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every one of them over and over and over again we get pathetic and ugly acting by natalie portman who can do good work disjointed pacing of key scenes and time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the wal mart parking lot an embarrassing display of emotions by the characters making the audience ill taking two great comedic screenwriters babaloo mandel and lowell ganz and forcing them to write drama on par with oprah book club altogether it has the feeling of being trapped at home watching very bad television mini series and wishing it to end only the remote is broken however the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up where is the heart no one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk
stars armand assante mike hammer barbara carrera dr charlotte bennett laurene landon velda alan king charles kalecki geoffrey lewis joe butler paul sorvino detective pat chambers judson scott charles hendricks barry snider romero julia barr norma childs mpaa rating review in the 1982 updating of mickey spillane 1947 novel the jury hard boiled detective mike hammer is vietnam vet who drives shiny bronze trans am dresses like don johnson in miami vice with less pastels and has sworn off alcohol however he still smokes his lucky strikes detests all forms of authority and kills at whim beyond that the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page turner by spillane probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers the movie starts off with bang howler of an opening credits sequence that is cheap steal from the james bond series complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti rocky after that the movie and the book begin the same with the murder of jack williams frederick downs one armed detective and hammer best friend hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack death and with the help of his devoted secretary the blond and shapely velda laurene landon and the alternately friendly antagonistic police chief pat chambers paul sorvino he is immediately on the killer trail here the movie splits completely from the book and dives into convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia the cia one of hammer vietnam vet buddies and kinky sex clinic many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie but they take on slightly different roles for instance charles kalecki alan king numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book turns into suave mob boss and more importantly hammer suspicious love interest charlotte bennett barbara carrera morphs from run of the mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic the jury is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane books including 1953 version which was made in but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood production code although this takes the 1982 version of the jury closer to the core of the original subject matter it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book rest assured the movie not only includes great deal of nudity but it is thoroughly violent especially toward women it features one woman having her neck slashed set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia judson scott and another woman shot point blank in the belly by hammer himself no one would deny that spillane writing has definite misogynistic nature but the movie seems to take it step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment its constant equation of sex and violence much of which is played with the intention of being erotic is quite unsettling it no surprise that the movie like the book fades to siyah with dead woman on the floor the jury had troubled production and was not well supported by the studio that made it which is one explanation why it didn do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made the script was written by larry cohen who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies like it alive 1974 and its two sequels 1981 and the stuff 1985 cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well but he was yanked from the director chair after only week worth of shooting because he was already $100 000 over budget he was quickly replaced by richard heffron who has worked for the last three decades on handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently it shows in the final product cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer but heffron has none he shot the movie quickly and clumsily and although some scenes ring true most of them are flat trite and invariably dull the movie features numerous car chases shoot outs and stunts but heffron background in television is the dominant tone despite the graphic violence and full frontal nudity the jury takes on the air of made for tv quickie with no real punch or depth but the problems in the jury run deeper than the technical the central fault in this updating is mike hammer whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person hammer character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona we never really get that impression in the movie there is no first person voice over narration and some scenes don have hammer in them at all consequently great deal of the texture of spillane storytelling is lost the period updating turns out to be detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer moral code is thrown to the wind despite his characterization as hard nosed violent misogynistic killer hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code the title itself the jury refers to his anti establishment notion of being his own law unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment in this way he can be seen as above the law but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct his own morality the movie forgoes that aspect of his character and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society terms but in any terms especially his own if anything hammer always had his professionalism but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful maybe the scene was intended for laughs but it only cheapens hammer character and is by all accounts lousy way to start the movie the blame for hammer character can be laid on assante shoulders because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon like mumbling he delivers fine performance spillane never once described hammer physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared so any actor could conceivably portray him of course because of the lack of written description those who have read spillane books will have strong personal notion of what hammer looks like and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations spillane who played the character himself in 1963 the girl hunters is generally considered the best of the film hammers the rest of actors are most un noteworthy with the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino everyone who appeared in the jury were up and comers who basically went nowhere many of them ended up working in television like carrera who had short stint on dallas in the mid eighties which only adds to the made for tv atmosphere of the film maybe someday someone will manage to get the right elements together and make an effective film rendition of spillane book but this is certainly not it
there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling hapless straight man from the hysterical naked gun films crack an immediate smile and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he committed himself to starring in since the wavering movie spoofs however are less forgivable to be fair wrongfully accused the send up in question and nielsen third parody since the last gun isn quite as excruciatingly humorless as his dracula dead and loving it or spy hard which is mighty good thing nielsen is still in tip top comedic form able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns but he really needs screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them and he needs one very soon wrongfully accused meshes together the premises of the fugitive and patriot games casting its always game star as ryan harrison get it master violinist who is drawn into an affair with married temptress kelly le brock she however sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband michael york crime actually committed by one armed one legged one eyed man aaron pearl harrison is arrested found guilty and sentenced to death but escapes from prison bus of course and then is pursued by determined marshal named fergus falls richard crenna unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones already smirky oscar winning role there also mystery brunette melinda mcgraw and an assassination subplot involving the secretary general but like any of it matters wrongfully accused gets off to an assured start with an in concert nielsen touted lord of the violin by bare chested posters pulling jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo clad mosh in front of the stage nice touch most of the scenes that follow however never top the opener hysterical exceptions the mentos and baywatch goofs movie parodies are crammed in at an almost subliminal rate but most are empty when giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches cast member la anaconda or baseball players disappear into field of dreams esque cornfield there really nothing to laugh at other moments like an interlude in fishing shop are so unfocused that you re not sure what you re supposed to be laughing at there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send ups here so it possible that director writer pat proft by bombarding the viewer with careless mixture of the two guarantees something is sure to stick and what does stick sticks well particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks and hard boiled dialogue what those naked gun which proft collaborated on did great these bits are so on target that they allow you to remember wrongfully accused as an almost halfway there spoof instead of lame brained failure the movie might have been cursed to begin with opening fast on the heels of mafia from proft colleague jim abrahams and baseketball from proft colleague david zucker but it strong possibility that nobody is going to be accusing wrongfully accused of being nielsen funniest
movies like six days seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford anne heche and ivan reitman put lot of hard work in to script worth about ten cents the script was written by michael browning and he decided that instead of thinking up new ideas he rehash lot of cliches omit even the slightest bit of character development and then throw in drug dealing pirates to provide for few high level action sequences and explosions there are good scripts out there that high profile actors can make see the truman show for instance six days seven nights is simply waste let see we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island so how do we do that well we ll make her feisty magazine editor and we ll make him crusty old pilot but wait she has to have fianc that can be david schwimmer but wait if she has fianc how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone know they ll get to their vacation spot and then she ll get called back yessssss so they ll crash on the island and that will be funny for about five minutes shucks oh ve got it we ll throw in distracting subplot in which her fianc has sex with really attractive woman who acts like bimbo and then he can feel guilty then when anne heche kisses harrison ford they have to kiss because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie it will be vindicated action because her fianc will already have cheated on her then for no obvious reason they ll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them oh yes feel so good about this story instead of using characterization to propel the events it will be completely random and yet totally predictable imagine that don get me wrong six days seven nights is not boring picture ford and heche both do great job the sparks fly between them and so most of browning inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors sheer force of talent almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen and found myself laughing pretty hard schwimmer is also funny and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get and reitman who has made some good films at least tries to make things exciting even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences it just when start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces the picture feels like it been hacked to pieces wouldn be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely the ones that are here are as bad as they come think let out very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships and just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream why did you pick this awful script the film is outright stupid but some of the elements are subtly horrifying for instance take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo and then feels really guilty this is serious problem in real life but six days seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to weak plot device his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford in script that lacks even glimpse of intelligent subtlety find it odd that such strangely insulting device ended up in the story this is summer movie season but that doesn mean our movies have to be dumb 1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters when was in line for six days seven nights heard the woman in front of me ask for two tickets to that new harrison ford movie why didn she know the name of the film suppose she just didn care what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big budget pictures don realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves good actors should sign to good scripts and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash they least they could do is assume that we like to spend our money on story worth more than ten cents
if anything stigmata should be taken as warning against releasing similarly themed films relatively close to one another of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year it is clearly the worst suppose should have seen this coming after all blair witch thoroughly creeped me out sixth sense was mildly spooky and then stir of echoes had its moments but wasn anything lose sleep over clearly the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping is it then any surprise that stigmata is the dullest most horribly executed piece of mtv influenced tripe have seen in long while no not really patricia arquette plays frankie page hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives rosary as gift from her globe trotting mother as it turns out the rosary belonged to recently deceased brazilian priest the priest church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne because of the mysterious appearance of bleeding statue father kiernan is an investigator who has made career out of disproving supposed religious signs but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue his investigation is soon called off however when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata in which person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie story considering she an atheist but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on he eventually begins to suspect that his boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church as it turns out the dead priest had been working on the translation of fifth gospel before they were excommunicated the new rupert wainwright music video mean film stigmata is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse indeed it would have been good if it were music video because it only interesting for about five minutes not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow motion double exposure and extreme close ups whoaaaaaa other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and yes he has been to film school his camera trickery is interesting for little while but eventually it becomes headache inducing what this film needed is second audio track to be played over the dialogue such as it is with wainwright screaming at the audience see look at what can do an ex cellent dir ect or maybe then he explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow motion shots of water dripping in reverse or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ooh scary if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery didn see it just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story here comes double exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever arrrrrrrghhhh then again the superfluous camera trickery wouldn bother me if stigmata had story or characters that were remotely engaging though wainwright vanity certainly doesn help he does seem to have been given nearly unworkable script where are plot continuity and character development when you need them case in point frankie page is the character that assume we are supposed to identify and sympathize with but we aren given any back story on her character or any reason to like her the extent of her character development seems to be that she is hard working hairdresser who can somehow afford cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building and she kind of cute so let start the bleeding the fact that she clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn help either according to frankie page what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back go clubbing sure that makes sense arquette byrne and pryce give it the old college try but their characters are so one dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable even though frankie page life is falling apart before her very eyes she still finds the time to hit on priest who wanders in to her hair salon even more curiously he seems to be interested in her advances father andrew religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic as for pryce he may as well wear curled mustache and cackle ll get you my pretty for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded trust me not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be villain what worse after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats we now have to contend with story that starts off in one direction veers off in another then another and ends up being totally incomprehensible first of all the film doesn even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching rosary how come an atheist like her was chosen since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata actually not sure what frankie was posessed by supposedly stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest and later by some evil spirit think which one is it the answer to this question of course is very simple the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr wainwright wants to use this time furthermore the ending is ridiculously neat little wrap up and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into diatribe against the catholic church if you do any research at all about the gospel of st thomas you ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church as the film seems to claim but that it is readily available at your local library there nothing the catholics need to worry about though stigmata religion is so off base that it can be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters they should have gone all out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns which would have been far more interesting not catholic in fact don care much for the catholic church but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means it rare to see film that fails on as many levels as stigmata does it not thought provoking though it would like to be and it is definitely not scary though it pretends to be not sure why they tried to pass this off as horror film because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story maybe it an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over and over and over like so many films of the mtv generation this one suffers from overkill so much is overdone in stigmata that it eventually has no effect on the audience leaving us to pick out the film many flaws also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st thomas is so earth shattering when we finally hear it the saying sounds like something every five year old learns on their first day of sunday school which means that for all its flash the whole film is really much ado about nothing the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog and stigmata is it
