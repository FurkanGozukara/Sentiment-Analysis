really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone sure she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god green earth second only to that movie critic at large guy but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in she always strikes out the crush was slow moving predictable piece of fluff hideaway was horrific novel adaptation alicia had only minor role in clueless was an annoying unfunny waste of time and people have mailed me too saying clueless is good movie and that the only one who doesn like it one girl said if seen the movie with an open mind would have enjoyed it nothing could be further from the truth went into the theater expecting to love the movie the preview looked good and of course crazymadinlove with alicia but the movie was bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny unlikable characters almost everyone saw the movie with felt the same way when we were walking out of the theater one guy and it wasn me yelled out that was the worst f$&#in movie ve ever seen and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement so last night walked into the video store and saw alicia pretty face on the cover of some made for video thriller called the babysitter knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway what got was 90 minutes of regret the worst alicia silverstone movie ever and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like where to begin in criticizing this movie the plot is thin shred that moves slower than glacier the writing could have been done and for all we know it was by ten year old alicia is the star and she still wasted in movie that has no appeal whatsoever there is zero humor zero suspense zero drama and zero action until the last ten minutes when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with violent sequence zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero so why does this movie get one star out of me well alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub and if it wasn bubble bath the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four star features but you settle for what you can get alicia plays babysitter who spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at cocktail party and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home at least that movie critic at large guy does as the movie trods along we discover she not only the mostly silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character fantasies and probably every male viewer too the drunken father thinks she just the thing to recapture his lost youth her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she taking her bubble bath they even throw in the middle aged wife fantasies about male counterpart at the party not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in siyah silk teddy at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg rated in fact could imagine the babysitter becoming cinemax late night staple if not for the fact that there absolutely no nudity in it so you can call it sex flick ve already pointed out that it can fall under drama comedy thriller or action so what do you classify the babysitter as bad
if you re into watching near on two hours of bored foul mouthed florida teens having sex doing drugs having sex listening to eminem having sex playing video games having sex and killing one of their peers then bully for you based on jim schutze novelization of true life event bully charts the story of handful of disenchanted teenagers who in 1993 murdered their high school bully in cold calculated blood the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers in the hands of controversial director larry clark kids however it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker pornographic proclivities in terms of the incident and what provoked it bully stirs up nothing new the high schoolers are presented as uniformly screwed up lot bored with life not much ambition promiscuous profane the bully in question bobby kent nick stahl is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department he hounds and harries and humiliates his best friend marty played by brad renfro and marty girlfriend lisa rachel miner doesn care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby simply remove him from the equation marty and lisa and handful of their promiscuous profane and stoner friends plus recruited hit man lure bobby to swamp one night stab him beat him over the head with baseball bat and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators presumably finish him off there no remorse the next day they re talking about it as openly as homework assignment they did it because they wanted to and because they could what most troubling about the film however isn the unsettling subject matter and the matter of fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in bully but there also an uneasy exploitative feel to it gratuitous crotch shots abound one of which makes the zipper cut away in there something about mary look like the height of subtlety clark is so pre occupied with his female predominantly leads that you forget at times what this movie is supposed to be about the stripping bare literally and figuratively of these actors who are after all playing underage teenagers becomes harder to watch over time as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera the conclusion of bully offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime it short sequence of stills heather years ali 40 years lisa life imprisonment for example but it infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it bully aims for truth exploits it shamelessly then bludgeons it to death
among multitude of erotic thrillers that had been released in the early 1990s woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty star of the grade action films of the previous decade those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star as director ginty did very little to improve that impression the protagonist of the movie is jack played by jeff fahey yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford played by bo derek however she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby steven bauer one stormy night the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder however his good friend walter hill robert mitchum happens to be very good lawyer so jack might even prove his innocence in the end belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots unfortunately this film isn comedy and any laugh is unintentional the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them the actors that play them don help either that is especially the case with jeff fahey whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like genius in comparison his partner bo derek on the other hand shows that she didn age enough to cease being the sex goddess but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents ginty on the other hand tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer
party camp is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies ve seen in awhile late rip off of the meatballs series the film follows group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk that really about all that can be said about the plot because nothing much happens except that the main character wise cracking jerry andrew ross has the hots for cute blonde kerry brennan and there is big contest in the climax how fun since party camp has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative it not that think exploitation is necessarily good quality but when you are talking about dull turkey like this the least that could have been done would be to fill it with lot of mindless sex even psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick at least then it wouldn have been such chore to sit through never before have seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat the comedy was easy to spot but it wasn the least bit funny it was groan inducing constantly throghout was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything so what saves party camp from the dreaded zero star rating well that simple jewel shepard as flighty bimbo was admittedly fun to watch although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash at least if the film had centered on shepard she might have been able to add little spice to an otherwise rancid low budget teen comedy
all through its production and into the early days of its initial aborted pre release publicity hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood ultimately however paramount pictures nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996 other underperforming disaster films dante peak volcano changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly year but to paraphrase the bard swill by any other name would smell as rank no number of name changes can help this picture it not just about disaster it is disaster hard rain is the case of movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute the best shot occurs during the opening credits as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg indiana as the water level slowly rises the community protected by an overworked dam is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud choked skies from that moment on it all downhill whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point it takes forever to get to the end credits this is one of the longest seeming 95 minute motion pictures have recently endured basically hard rain is one extended dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot outs there lot of water broken glass gunfire and explosions it all very routine and uninteresting because there aren any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense the film conclusion is so preposterous that it almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards conclusion graham yost the writer of both speed and hard rain surely understands that principle unfortunately neither he nor cinematographer turned director mikael salomon far off place applies it the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition we see the same kinds of things speedboat chases flood damage shoot outs etc over and over again the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length the storyline gives us number of paper thin characters in contrived circumstances there tom christian slater the one dimensional action hero who works as security guard driving an armored car full of cash he and his partner charlie edward asner tv lou grant get stuck on street that rapidly turning into river group of men led by jimmy morgan freeman arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers after charlie is killed in shoot out tom hides the money then runs as he swims and boats his way through huntingburg roads he encounters some of the locals karen minnie driver would be love interest bickering old couple richard dysart and betty beyaz who are on hand to provide comic relief and the easily corrupted sheriff randy quaid whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives there isn any real acting in this film christian slater utters few lame one liners and does lot of mugging for the camera tom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen randy quaid sneers lot and is totally unconvincing morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances but they are defeated by the script freeman one of the best cinematic thespians working today looks suitably embarrassed to be here but suppose everyone needs good paycheck from time to time following in the wake of twister this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn trust nature fury as the chief engine of conflict as result we are saddled with an idiotic good guys bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had titanic proved that there can be wealth of drama in movie where everything goes under water hard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible thus far this year hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire firestorm and water hard rain fortunately there are only two elements left
instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as powerful or touching have name for it myself gross this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to bully the bully looks at the rebel threateningly about to hurt him and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me aren present day moviegoers beyond being inspired by something like that this is one example there are actually some more in instinct alone of filmmakers insulting the audience intelligence instinct plot is brimming with potential world renowned anthropologist ethan powell anthony hopkins disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa he was found and is coming back to the united states convicted killer he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him after committing few more brutal acts of violence in the airport the authorities stick him in prison psychotics ward assigned to do an evaluation on powell is bright or so we are told young psychiatrist theo caulder cuba gooding jr caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career of course and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not psychotic and that he should not be in prison and then there the inevitable heartless meanie character in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder mentor he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell let get one thing straight dr theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist have ever seen on screen or off any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn great deal about his patient that way not good old theo no he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says we need to talk about this right now this is flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct already dubious credibility unfortunately it also the least of its problems director jon turteltaub who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that contrary to what this movie promotion would have you believe it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs it not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus excuse the graphic depiction it aims to inspire rather than to touch hearts as yoda would say inspire it does not it is the ultimate sign of futility when screenwriter the very experienced gerald di pego has to resort to literally telling the audience movie story indeed somewhere in the beginning of instinct one of the characters actually reads aloud the film plot to another character this like the instance mentioned in the first paragraph of this review is horrid insult to our intelligence am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors and he chews the scenery in this movie brilliant as ever oscar winner cuba gooding jr on the other hand is dreadful his performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being shrink liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling love animals and instinct prominent save the gorillas live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something could sympathize with however this movie execution is completely unacceptable tone down the violence and this will be chick flick 1999 eugene novikov
sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades like twelve angry men serpico or the verdict but in the same time almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet reputation stranger among us 1992 rip off of peter weir witness belongs to the latter category the heroine of this movie is emily eden melanie griffith tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york during one of such actions her partner nick jamey sheridan got hurt and as result she becomes depressed in order to help her recover bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community she decides to go undercover that isn easy because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel eric thal using peter weir formula isn the greatest flaw of this film even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent but the worst insult to viewer audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith the author of this review never liked this actress very much but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles role of emily eden unfortunately isn one of them first of all she can pass for tough nypd street fighter and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn much better screenplay by robert avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic kirmizi herring subplots scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch but on the other hand other actors are more convincing lee richardson as an old rabbi thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community also the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time
one of the responses those that enjoy detroit rock city probably kiss fans mostly might have upon first glance at the rating ve given the film might be something like oh that casey gone and become jaded critic on us just what did he expect out of dumb teenage rock roll movie like this wondering the same thing feel like should have had grand time with detroit rock city it the sort of movie wish could ve had lot of fun with but didn just didn surely this film isn trying to win any major awards so should have expected an oscar caliber film no but expected something funny joke clever prank plot development anything the movie never delivers you ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with movie that is truly about nothing detroit rock city is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film existence and it not very satisfying realization the film is about four teenage boys all huge kiss fans from cleveland trying to get into kiss concert in detroit michigan that it there is no big plot description in this review because the movie has very little plot the characters are hawk edward furlong lex giuseppe andrews trip james debello and jam sam huntington they have garage band they re pathetic like all garage bands but they like kiss and they like rock roll so guess that means we root for them they have tickets they lose them they get more tickets they lose those too they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets most of which backfire there not much more to it frankly it becomes little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film when total of eight tickets have already graced the boys hands only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity oh and jam real name jeremiah has really really annoying ultra religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency she doesn want them to see kiss if you hadn figured that out already it really quite disheartening to see such fine soundtrack go to waste in pointless movie like this we ve got plenty of kiss along with some ac dc ramones and thin lizzy then again maximum overdrive had an awesome soundtrack me being the big ac dc fan that am but is probably one of the worst movies of all time detroit rock city doesn quite reach that level of ineptitude but it gets dangerously close in fact the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being complete failure in my mind basically the soundtrack has earned the film full half star which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back except for marilyn manson whose half hearted cover of ac dc highway to hell sounds like something my neighbor cat coughed up it also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste because it evident that they re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of movie edward furlong has done far better work than this and so has natasha lyonne and so has lin shaye but hey they ve got to make living in hollywood people wanting to see kiss and lots of it will probably be disappointed considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song too bad they might have provided some energy to this mess director adam rifkin knows he hasn got much material to work with so he takes chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning we get an endless parade of quick cuts split screens zoom outs zoom ins and rotating cameras all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script it fun for while but eventually it becomes disorienting would recommend that those who felt seasick at the blair witch project stay far away from detroit rock city because the witch has got nothing on this baby haven felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since armageddon and what about that script it written by carl dupr which sounds like as made up name as ve ever heard if it is can say blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible plotless pointless rock roll movie can be fun if the jokes and gags are actually funny the jokes in detroit rock city rarely are in fact the only time really laughed was when priest gets stoned on marijuana laced pizza and that was just because it was so surreal the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it comedy there is no set up just succession of punchlines that don provide for much in the way of chuckles precisely because there was no set up it as if they just whacked someone on the head pointed at him and said see funny look that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink see funny look that guy just got clocked by telephone receiver twice see funny look that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money see funny word of advice to mr dupr no these things aren funny all by themselves they must be preceded by clever set up so the audience hasn predicted them five minutes in advance that it ve said enough about this movie it waste of time and money liked the music but don bother buying the soundtrack hear it just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie you want to see this concept executed well go rent roger corman 1979 classic rock roll high school it features another late seventies rock band the ramones and far more interesting story about girl trying to get tickets to their show yes go rent that and skip detroit rock city which will probably bomb and deservedly so
the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes with everything ranging from confidential to palmetto to the big lebowski has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran talented directors with this particular genre directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower class and the glamorous opulent upper class while maintaining the noirish ambiguous ambience the staple of film noir wild things could be classified as siyah comedy sultry film noir or plain ol erotic thriller but the one category it doesn qualify for is that of quality motion picture overacted overwrought and overlong wild things is confused mess movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too with its incalculable twists turns more twists and more turns it soon becomes tedious exercise in pointlessness in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal wild things not once jells in its eroticism unpredictability character motivation sense of the world plot etc there not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical directed by john mcnaughton henry portrait of serial killer wild things follows sam lombardo matt dillon hunkish suburban florida high school teacher who the dream of every spruced up female in the community particularly one kelly van ryan denise richards adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with partner soon her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take hike enabling her to come into his house next thing she cries rape and the so called roller coaster ride ensues second accuser comes front suzie toller neve campbell booze drinkin tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her virtually guaranteeing trial where preposterous confessions asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo zany lawyer he wears fake neck brace waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role as ridiculous as it sounds he the most sane character in the movie the community is astonished reporters flee to the scene there an million settlement for libel suit against kelly mother theresa russell there the ambiguous cop kevin bacon who also executive produced who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit murder and lust we the audience sniff something not so lustful like so many thrillers these days including the usual suspects and the game wild things eschews character for plot mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease as if he knows the territory he covering is harmless appetizer to accompany henry furious unsettling film directorial tour de force george clinton score is delight to behold but it the humans the characters are mere devices for the nasty twists what writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving almost unbearable if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting don feel real or we don care for them not even the unintentionally funny moments work the people in wild things are not so much people as they are caricatures then there the erotic content which nearly earned the film an nc 17 for sexless badly edited poorly lit menage trois and in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country kevin bacon member makes cameo appearance with ten minutes to go ironically the wildest elements of wild things are not wild at all
there 000 foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies which are getting more irwin allen esque with every release the early wave of this revival while just as cheesy and laughable at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes deep impact tries to disguise itself as human drama with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking the repeating cycle is as follows the president morgan freeman will go on tv and tell the country that there remote chance comet will strike the earth but that the nation crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem then we get to see the plan in action in some sequence utterly lacking suspense the mission will barely fail and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth and there remote chance it will strike but that the nation crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem it goes on and on throughout the movie but every time freeman goes on tv we know his plan is going to fail how do we know this because we ve seen the tv ads for deep impact ads that feature freeman telling the nation that the comet is still headed right for us and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading ladies and gentlemen that is the movie successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30 second tv spots television is what wrong with deep impact the main character played by tea leoni is low level broadcast journalist for msnbc and that the mere tip of the product placement iceberg who stumbles upon huge government conspiracy she thinks it an instance of an ex secretary of something or other james cromwell resigning because of mistress and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area when she goes nosing around cromwell he begs her to keep it under wraps know you re just reporter but you used to be human being she figures out what really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search where all good journalists learn the difference between mistress and an extinction level comet upon top secret meeting with president freeman leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold press conference at which she gets to ask the first question and everyone knows if you get to ask the first question baby you re star leoni ends up in the anchor chair broadcasting every step of the comet collision course with earth and sure it comforting for her to know that even though the world ending in matter of months she cable news personality so there she is narrating the six astronaut mission to blow the comet up such personalities as robert duvall jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged out process but as anyone who seen the commercials knows the astronauts fail they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces which means even more destruction to the earth yeah thanks nasa that when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years they even have animals two by two ready to climb into the cave if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed deep impact could have been far more interesting movie instead we watch as lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife while people pack the highways out of town the reasoning is of course that if comet is going to strike they might as well be out in some scenic rural location and amusingly the highway is spotted with people in haul trucks sure it comforting to know that even though the world ending in matter of minutes the haul people are doing the most business of their lives
various films seen at the seattle film festival it all true three men on raft 1942 1986 director orson welles recently uncovered one fourth of orson welle planned docu drama of amazing stories around the world named it all true this short dealt with welle attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on raft while several clips of the film are seen the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle attempts to film it despite studio problems staggering workload and extremely ill fortune on the set impressive photography but really only interesting to film historians sadie thompson 1928 director raoul walsh screenwriter raoul walsh from the john colton play rain based on somerset maugham story miss thompson cast gloria swanson raoul walsh lionel barrymore silent after the discussion of the newly restored version of frank capra lost horizon where several scenes had been restored using stills was interested to see sadie thompson where the last minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story miss thompson this is one of the most skillful silent films have ever seen little awkwardness and very clever script the actors gloria swanson raoul walsh who also directed and wrote the screenplay and especially lionel barrymore as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie soul but really wants to get her between the sheets is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel swanson adds real life to the character adding an worldly affectionate air to the bawdy sadie unfortunately the ending is rather poorly tied up it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live action film or the original script the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on cannot believe maugham short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia the stills are expected to fill in conclusion we ve been waiting an hour and half for still it entertaining right up to the end certainly barrymore incredibly hammy performance which nonetheless works perhaps due to the silent screen is must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells bakkers and robertses of the religious worlds movie worth 50 if you can find it the pied piper czechoslovakia 1986 director jim barta screenwriter kamil piza this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with twist ending find highly appropriate and with lot of political comment along with it perhaps economic content is better word it certainly doesn show capitalism in good light nor human nature nor anything else for that matter as you may have guessed this is not tgif film this is the kind of film you are glad is over not that it wasn interesting for technical reasons this is stop animation that is very well done all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts except for the animated stuffed rats boy sounds like real comedy vehicle doesn it add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison and you have something to give the wee ones and some of the mentally unstable larger folk to keep them up at night some gore don bring children to this one don bring adults to this one unless they re fascinated by puppetry and or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped blech no fun whatsoever meier west germany 1986 director screenwriter peter timm cast rainier grenkowitz nadja engelbrecht alexander hauff thomas besvater sub titled this film takes us back and forth over the east german west german border with meier an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him good deal of money his uncle also in the west sneaks meier out of the country unknown to the east germans meier however is less than thrilled his girlfriend his friends and his job which he likes all exist in east germany after round the world trip his boss think he on leave in bulgaria meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with fake id and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew work while everyone think he still living in east germany of course something goes wrong and the ending is very funny but it takes the film too long to get there the humor is spread too thin and much of the plot is too obvious as is the acting still good concept for the comedy and the last five minutes are pretty funny $2 50 the right hand man australia 1986 director di drew screenplay helen hodgman cast rupert everett hugo weaving arthur dignam jennifer claire catherine mcclements after lifetime of movie going and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival ve learned several rules which while not absolute should certainly be given deference to be wary of french comedies these people like jerry lewis ken russell is never going to grow up no matter how long you wait any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as old pouty lips is probably not worth watching when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography watch out australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo but since weir and miller left for foreign shores finding good script or director seems to be difficult not impossible witness malcolm last year task well ignored rules last night and sat through film that should be in the golden turkey awards it as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30 about tragedy among the gentry and falling in love with people below your station and horses lots and lots of horses the film opens with stallion mounting mare under the direction of her ladyship which guess is some kind of foreshadowing because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir unfortunately said son reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times kills his father and loses an arm during racing accident highlights include the amputation sequence the doctor daughter who has the hots for the son tasting his urine for diagnosis their tender kissing with window between them while it raining you think woman studying medicine would know better the photography is good but kept wishing for b&w everything seems sepia colored anyway actually wished was watching swimming to cambodia instead but that life grade avoid like the plague unless you re looking for inadvertent yuks
based on the 1960s tv series that had never seen or heard of before this movie be happy won bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons this film allows will smith to take third stab at the independence day weekend box office after scoring huge successes with men in siyah 10 directed by the same man who controlled this one and independence day 10 can you say the third times not charm plot james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation top scientists and threatening to take over the united states within week critique did not laugh once during this entire picture when you consider that this film is part comedy that not very good sign also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes when you consider that the other part of this film is geared as an action adventure would say that this another negative sign and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and little slow the story line tired reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside plot filled with lame one liners weak characterizations and an anti climactic end you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this big summer blockbuster it blows or as they say in french eet blows could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it maybe could it be that most of the special effects don show up until the last half hour and even then we don see anything that its trailers hadn already given away perhaps or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big budget movies that we cannot help but evaluate them on scale onto their own naaaaaaah bad movie is bad movie on positive note could honestly say that did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek who seemed underused in my humble opinion and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in branagh was also fun as the scenery munching over the top bad guy but that pretty much where the entertainment buck stopped smith and kline were static at best the plot full of holes and the score insignificant and derivative of dozen others would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie then again there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in cage huh oh yeah but the rest of the movie sucked little known facts about this film and its stars will smith has starred in two of the ten all time top grossing films worldwide 1997 summer blockbuster men in siyah 10 for which he also recorded the grammy winning title song and 1996 independence day 10 he once turned down scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career kevin kline is graduate of the juilliard school of drama and has been married to the cute as button actress phoebe cates since 1989 they have two kids together greta simone and owen one of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has kasdan written on it lawrence kasdan is director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies including the big chill silverado love you to death grand canyon and french kiss salma hayek gave up successful career as major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over even though she spoke no english she made her feature film debut as an actress with small role in allison anders mi vida loca no not the rickie martin video and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez desperado opposite antonio banderas since then she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez films she stands was born in southeast mexico and the daughter of lebanese father and mexican mother one of the actresses cast as branagh lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in kirmizi corner 10 another is dutch born frederique van der wal who is one of the world most recognized supermodels having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times as well as harper bazaar vogue and mademoiselle
forget get carter instead get me cup of coffee what the hell has happened to all good american action movies did unknowingly miss meeting somewhere when did all of the bad ass kicking butt and taking names gun toting crazed vengeful characters of the 1980 from such films as commando cobra predator raw deal first blood suddenly turn into innocent compassionate sensitive teary eyed knuckleheads the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east and don mean new york city get carter the latest masterpiece from uber thespian sylvester stallone is prime example of large and in charge 80 action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up few years ago stallone made movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland strange film about redemption within broken soul stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past too bad get carter returns stallone to action but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges get carter is simple story stallone plays frank carter vegas bruiser for loan shark played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore when frank brother gets himself killed in drunk driving accident frank feeling all guilty and mushy inside thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented carter way he talks tough with his brother wife lends helping had to his brother daughter doreen rachel leigh cook and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like lost member of the rat pack with really bad goatee carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with slimy porn king played by ultra cool mcqueen esque mickey rourke multi millionaire computer geek alan cumming and strange foreign guy michael caine who speaks in riddles and talks tough carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties what minute this sounds just like another film saw last year the limey better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off actually get carter is remake of the 1971 british production of the same name starring caine in the title role and what with his cameo here the cleverness is astonishing while stallone still carries his own weight here the movie lacks what the original did as well purpose throughout the film stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough while nobody is taking him seriously his one liners fall flat and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions mental and physical required of his character there is even strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends bizarre tone to their numerous conversations in both fists and words the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs spousal abuse boxing career and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way rourke still brings dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character he may not win any oscars but he still ranks highly in my book get carter has great directing strong acting by rourke and caine and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud the only thing it lacks as with most hollywood productions is good script and proper casting never mind that it should never have been made at all
you don need to have seen the original species to appreciate how utterly lousy species ii is with few exceptions sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them but the fact that species ii is follow up isn the only reason it so miserable it the predictable storyline the cardboard characters the banal dialogue the failed attempts at humor the revolting special effects the gratuitous nudity all female of course the bad acting and the bland direction the plot simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in soil sample back aboard their shuttle the slime well sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns siyah that should have been the end of the movie right there back on terra firma at least one of the crew is now carrier of alien dna and as you ll remember if you saw the first movie driven by strong urge to procreate on parallel track government scientists have cloned version of sil from the first film now called eve again played by natasha henstridge and are keeping her around for some testing this apparently includes observing eve reaction to the dukes of hazzard tv show which she appears to enjoy eve bio rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk mates which we are forced to witness in gross out detail but otherwise there doesn appear to be whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film unless it was written into her contract let hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only eve finally breaks free of her confines and her bra for the finale but the effects are so messy you can really see what going on peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams told em not to go at the top of his lungs referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox so that he can enter high security areas flash badge and claim to be press maybe as does marg helgenberger as dr laura baker the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns they re both unbelievably wooden what talented filmmaker like peter medak the ruling class the krays let him have it doing directing this tripe wonder it an unfortunate trend this once talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like species ii last year peter hyams gave us the relic no thanks necessary there and the first species was helmed by roger donaldson who although certainly no genius behind the camera had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects is it just that there are no better offers out there species ii is worthless worse than that it also exploitative offensive and insulting to the intelligence at every turn it not that there isn anything positive to say about the film there is after 92 minutes it ends
never understood what the clich hell on earth truly meant until very recently ve just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying so horrible so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as hell on earth after all ve never been to war ve never been the victim of any violent crime ve never really been broken hearted and ve never been audited so really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was hell on earth then saw cruel intentions in perfect world would be in charge of all the movie studios the very first thing do in this perfect world would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with 20 something cast playing teenagers and featuring soundtrack ripped directly from mtv and throw them in jail but it wouldn just be your average jail not even maximum security installation have these producers and everyone else involved in the production of these films put in front of war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity now you re probably thinking to yourself is this really how bad cruel intentions is the answer is no it actually much worse watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumble awfully written script is probably lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound and then pouring acid on the salt don know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum tara reid whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet but the only emotion felt was sheer boredom from that opening scene where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz to the conclusion which don remember because had practically fallen asleep cruel intentions is truly hell on earth right up there with war and tax audits
my opinion on film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors love love ralph fiennes love uma thurman love sean connery hell even big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago and ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever since few months into the summer however noticed that its release date had been changed few times and that it had ended up in the mid august dumping ground then in this final week before its official release learned that it was not to be screened for critics and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique my expectations fell to pieces when learned all of these things the film saw today didn even meet those expectations this is lousy incoherent mess would slam it harder if it weren for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine lovable actors but sets are ultimately empty and the performances are completely uninspired that the main problem with the avengers for all it hip hop flash and tidal waves none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired it like chore bland exercise in superhero film making it also feels like its been cut to pieces clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots this is just plain depressing the avengers is film version of the popular 60s television show frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that ve never watched an episode wasn alive then don even watch television now very sorry that don have this perspective but judging from the reviews ve already read knowing the tv show just makes matters worse didn know and love john steed and emma peel and therefore was not as upset to see how these actors love have managed to thrash their roles also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film based on what the film told me gather that steed fiennes is some kind of british super guy somewhat like james bond and that dr peel thurman is just really smart doctor who also happens to know lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits they are to work together under mother orders mother is played by jolly jim broadbent while his co conspirator father is played by the equally talented fiona shaw it seems that there is man out there controlling the weather his name is de wynter connery he is crazy scottish guy our heroes had better stop him or else the weather will keep getting colder until they have to go to hell to warm up one of the film few funny lines along the way there is subplot after subplot hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere feel perfunctory and ultimately make no sense for example our heroes are eventually attacked by swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos now killer bugs don really go with the weather controlling theme of the film the purpose of the bugs other than to annihilate our heroes is never established they re never even directly connected to de wynter they re controlled by his crazy henchman played by eddie izzard the special effects aren bad but they re loud obnoxious and intrusive like so many scenes in the film it seems present only to keep your attention from waning and guarantee you it will wane stopped thinking about the story when realized it didn do any good to think the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn tell us what happens there are several scenes in the preview that didn make the final cut in addition many of the sequences have irritating grainy film quality which makes it feel low budget the last scene is particularly bad the scenes that don feature action should be electric thanks to our wonderful cast they aren the action scenes should be electric because this is an action film they aren either and what about this wasted cast oh it makes me weep with disappointment we re talking ralph fiennes here one of the best actors working today one of the best actors ever love the guy ve loved all his films until this one he seems like he wants to understand the film but he as lost as we are and thurman in all of her spectacular beauty and talent can manage to look at home here don blame her completely for there is strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way and it can be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting connery however seems the most out of it totally lacking any kind of focus or interest for that matter who is to blame is it the screenwriter don macpherson perhaps although can see shell of story here that could have been good superhero movie had it been handled right is it the actors for god sake no these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling blame director jeremiah chechik who shouldn have been given the task to begin with his best film benny joon is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be but here it mostly seems like lot of failed attempts at wit and humor add to that lack of experience in big budget action and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory if the avengers has saving grace it the set design the sets by stuart craig are big colorful and often pleasing to look at like the final set piece on de wynter island even if none of it makes bit of sense admired the overhead view of the stairs showing dr peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere also enjoyed michael kamen music score particularly in the opening credits but this stuff is routine good sets and music are nice but there lot more that needs to be here inspiration for instance would have been really nice maybe little bit of cohesion in the story or sense of purpose most of all though would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles damn this movie for not giving them the chance
if you re the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn butter optional then this is the movie for you indeed this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip offs of other recent action movies or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them it difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film but at least we re warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show what are the four ingredients of really bad action movie first the movie gives us an introductory premise huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor and in this area many ships have disappeared oooh scary secondly cheesy soundtrack tries to connote tone of mystery but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score third the main character is mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo treat williams he operates sophisticated military style pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy finally in the cargo hold we see those that hired him they are also mercenaries that have tough looking haircuts talk with accents and try to show how macho they are during their trip across the stormy sea their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs spotting cruise ship in the distance they make their way to the ocean liner and devise plan to raid the machine shop take the parts that they need and then continue on their merry way little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster yet they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in matter of seconds this is nothing more than by the book action film their realization of the situation that they re in doesn happen until they are in the bowels of the boat those who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed the corridors on the ship are narrow misty and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare fests must have yet despite the predictable nature of this film there are some scary boo moments but most of it is just outright silly and this film is unusually gory too monsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains there is one particularly neat scene where monster has been cut apart and reveals victim that is still alive he screams horribly as the monster digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away additionally it borrows heavily from speed2 alien and bunch of other recent films the mercenaries even run into lone surviving passenger femke jannsen who looks amazingly like sandra bullock to be honest when left the theatre just had to laugh at how witless the film was it moronic fun at best so if you re hankering for large bucket of popcorn served with side of silliness then this might just hit the spot
capsule one of the ten worst movies ever made christopher lambert vs evil ninjas in modern day japan and nobody wins the hunted is such bad movie so completely inept and so totally brain damaged that could almost feel affection for it could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting good jolly guffaw out of it if it weren also insanely xenophobic and insulting christopher lambert plays computer parts salesman who on business in japan he meets slinky young woman joan chen and has torrid night of lovemaking with her and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader john lone apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered since lambert is witness he of course the next one to die let stop and think about this for second if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to ninja secret society he have lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock in this movie the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body you know what goof field is that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes klutz no matter what their real dexterity is this is of course only the beginning of the movie problems lambert eventually finds pseudo safety with long haired modern day samurai yoshio harada and his partner yoko shimada who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun they are the two best things in the movie in every scene they have authority and presence and they actually look like they belong here even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows the script doesn know what the hell to do with them lone as the bad guy is zero dimensional the only bad guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him in the hunted this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype what funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes there nice little scene with tokyo cabdriver and girl in pachinko parlor but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful also the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled superior soundtrack get the cd that manages to survive despite the drek it been designed to accompany there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing gory excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for moment and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re couple the whole thing with the movie relentlessly stupid plot by the time we get to the final showdown with lambert getting to wield his own sword which judging from the ham handed editing of one scene was forged in seven hours or so we no longer care we re not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies someone once said that the key to good art good movies good books whatever is to start somewhere interesting end up somewhere interesting and show respect for the audience all along the way this movie bungles two out of three badly
starring ben stiller elizabeth hurley maria bello janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz permanent midnight is pretty bad movie though it took me few days to conclude this the film is more masturbatory than bleak with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity he has $6000 week drug habit ultimately as adapted by veloz jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve you are less mystified by his self destructive nature than bored into stupor yourself ben stiller plays stahl young author who arrives in with ambition and nasty drug habit he eventually gets gig for $5000 week writing for sitcom called mr chompers thinly veiled stand in for alf chompers looks just like alf except he mavi marries producer hurley so she can get green card and hooks up with spanish mother liz torres who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons insert proverbial downward spiral here permanent midnight is structured mostly as flashback with recovering addict bello meeting stiller at fastfood restaurant where stiller works the drive thru as part of rehab taking him back to hotel and between bouts of serious screwing listening to his life story ve spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive worse ve been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive as stahl stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect post there something about mary of either the actor or comedy writer what separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk junkies it seems is that stahl wrote book about his idiocy watch stahl shoot heroin next to baby watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack fueled babble stiller gives technically flawless performance the film could double as documentary on how to be junkie but permanent midnight is mostly soulless when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved and then answers it in the form of bello character basically shrink in siyah panties could person care less in the film version of his autobiography of the same name stahl doesn need saving he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie it that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood types known to man stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs is this hollywood california learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead of course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems so basically his drug habit got him book deal movie based on his life and now he apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects so much for the moral of that story temporary midnight is more like it bill chambers september 1998
nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink and concussive nudge bombast rama con air the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill fated bar room brawl the prison scenes are accompanied by voice overs in which poe in languid southern drawl describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met if the scene gives you tickle of familiarity it probably should cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim witted and ridiculous and that he going to have to do something to keep himself entertained and thus he slips into familiar surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings cage plays cameron poe as buffed up version of raising arizona mcdonnough cage should have known what he was getting himself into he got paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock and if there one thing you can count on from bruckheimer production even without his late partner don simpson it that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage performance in the rock cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time that sense of discovery has been replaced by wry self awareness while the plot of con air finds poe parolee on board hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home cage goal is different but just as simple to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact audiences too should know what they re getting themselves into with bruckheimer production in fact the marketing people are counting on it no one who loathed the rock for its swear grunt blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded director simon west yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab soda fountain delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture it perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing diabetic coma like insulin con air does the work of gland what he doesn deliver is moment of suspense bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk really _really_ big desk and really _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension they might have done something with con air creepiest set up at desert stop for the plane load of convicts serial killer garland greene steve buscemi wanders of into trailer park where he meets little girl having tea party in drained swimming pool their tete tete is eerie and menacing providing welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi chance to stand out in cast with too many villains danny trejo ving rhames and characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them in fact con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement too many characters too much editing too many dopey punch lines too much of the cheap ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack as marshal goes for earnest cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep his recycled raising arizona performance is means of escape his chase after stuffed bunny continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies it doesn bode well for cage appearance in face off later this month perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over there word for people like you nicolas that word is called recidivist repeat offender
jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today from time to time she blows away audiences with powerful intense performances on the other hand this is the same woman who made her jaw droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis king kong and much as lange would probably prefer movie goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume every once in while she does work that is reminiscent of it if only in quality hush is one such example lange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn such prime example of motion picture tedium the film opens as many so called psychological thrillers do by posing as light drama we are introduced to jackson johnathon schaech last encounter in tom hanks that thing you do and helen gwyneth paltrow picture perfect young couple who are very much in love jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother martha lange the moment first saw martha started looking for fangs soon the wicked witch of the east is plotting way for her son to get helen pregnant this involves poking hole in diaphragm once that goal is accomplished she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives as long as she gets her way martha is perfectly amicable person but when helen defies her it declaration of war hush has three very simple problems it incredibly dumb it incredibly boring and it incredibly predictable at least up to the stupefying ending this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it with the exception of couple of nice shots of snow covered fields and quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow bare buttocks frankly it embarrassing to watch respected actress of lange stature give performance like this it like bad blanche dubois the role she played in 1995 tv version of streetcar named desire meanwhile paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines and schaech attempts passable imitation of an inanimate object as in all psychological thrillers the battle lines are clearly drawn here it mom and against wife with jackson caught in the middle of course since schaech character is poorly developed and badly acted it impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation maybe someone should ask him if he familiar with oedipus martha is of course the evil one how do we know she evil she smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor two sure signs that the devil is at work on the other hand helen is good girl the evidence for this is that she nice to old ladies and treasures locket with picture of her dead parents that about it for character development beyond that point hush is just series of increasingly hard to swallow coincidences contrivances and moronic plot twists however the first 85 minutes are just warm up for the ending which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying can imagine anyone no matter what they thought of the movie as whole liking this conclusion either there was some serious last minute editing or someone left out few pages of the script before the climax disliked hush by the time the end credits started hated it viewers invest something in every movie they watch no matter how good or bad it is cheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable most entries into this worn out worm eaten genre aren especially good films like consenting adults the hand that rocks the cradle and single beyaz female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along in general however they re directed with degree of competence that assures level of sustained tension that not the case with really bad thrillers like this which fail to generate even momentary heart palpitation the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care indeed the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid
the swirling sick feeling hit me just few minutes into heartbreakers ray liotta character was making out with his secretary when his new wife knocked on the door of his office while scrambling to collect himself he frantically shouted to her just wait sex er mean sec was struck by wave of revulsion thinking geez didn lines like that die when three company was canceled over the next few minutes as the barely double entendres and lingering cleavage shots grew more numerous realized that the mindset behind heartbreakers predated three company suddenly had an out of body experience as my internal way back machine swept me to the mid 1960s all across america the counter culture was growing like wildfire but there was scant evidence of it on tv while young people were challenging traditional values on the streets frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at home sulking while our parents enjoyed the latest bob hope special women in skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while hope made growling noises and leered at their breasts on another channel dean martin made wisecracks about booze and broads and peter lawford decked out in love beads and nehru jacket purred suggestive one liners as he ogled the go go dancers the adults laughed and laughed heartbreakers reeks of that stagnant mentality from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt vah vah voom breasts to its leaden screenplay which paints women as haughty schemers and men as drooling buffoons too sex obsessed to realize they are being manipulated in addition to liotta and hewitt the cast includes sigourney weaver gene hackman jason lee nora dunn and anne bancroft can imagine what drew performers of their caliber to this project perhaps they thought it was parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the 60s if so they were sadly mistaken the story revolves around mother daughter con team it opens with the marriage of max weaver to dean liotta new jersey chop shop operator having withheld sex until the honeymoon max pretends to pass out on their wedding night the next morning she feigns illness sending very horny dean off to the office where he ends up in the arms of his new secretary just as the two are about to get overtly physical max bursts into the room and catches them the horrified bride dissolves the union garnering healthy cash settlement along the way of course the secretary was really her daughter page hewitt and the whole thing was set up the women move on but an irs agent bancroft catches up with them and demands huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes in desperate need of funds max and page head for palm beach to replay the scam their mark this time is william tensy hackman in hideous make up decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking max starts to put the game into action but page is so repelled by the old man and angry with her mom that she slips off to enact her own score targeting jack laid back young beach bar owner who is worth fortune complications arise when page realizes that good natured jack is stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart as if that wasn enough dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind the attempt to weld romance onto caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior fish called wanda won bother to compare the two suffice to say that everything done right in wanda is done wrong here heartbreakers is soulless inept and at 123 minutes at least half hour too long sigourney weaver and jennifer love hewitt throw themselves into their parts but have nowhere to go with the metallic characters gene hackman is utterly wasted in one note one joke part that has him doing nothing but smoking coughing and waxing rhapsodic about smoking and sex poor jason lee is stuck in the ingenue role and the normally charismatic actor comes off as merely bland ray liotta manages to squeeze tiny bit of humanity and humor into his walking clich but only bit the low point in the film has weaver employing russian accent bad enough to make boris and natasha wince while doing half assed slapstick with broken off penis from statue bear in mind though that this is merely the worst segment of movie made up of nothing but low points if you remember bob hope specials with fondness this might be your cup of tea as for me going to watch fish called wanda now and try to forget ever saw heartbreakers
the first image in final fantasy the spirits within is computer animated close up of human eye it beautiful piece of work remarkably detailed and quite convincing when the picture pulls back to reveal the owner of the eye however things change the young woman has mesmerizing hair although it hangs too artfully even by movie standards to be believed the facial features are more detailed than any computer animation seen to date but the result is more reminiscent of very well crafted doll than anything human she is pretty but bland and not nearly expressive enough to come off like person all the characters in final fantasy are like that of the core group the younger beyaz men and women are all athletic attractive and indistinct like applicants for tv reality show the siyah man is taller and burlier and the aging scholar is bald with wrinkles and beard none of them appear to be based on individuals they all look like the products of general descriptions given police sketch artist it gets worse when they talk and move why is the sarcastic voice of steve buscemi he of the great twisted face and snaggleteeth coming out of the mouth of some dreary ken doll why for every fluid physical gesture do we also see herky jerky puppet style motions more to the point who decided full length computer animated movie featuring hyperreal their term not mine humanoids was good idea final fantasy is based on phenomenally popular video game ve never played with story straight out of japanese anime which more often than not leaves me bored and depressed if you re fan of either please spare me your letters as will focus solely on the finished film and not its source materials with an expression challenged cast final fantasy mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit the result is ugly confusing and boring note the following reveals the basic plot if you want to have fighting chance of making any sense of the movie suggest you read it earth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls most of our planet is devastated with humans living in few protected cities while the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies aki ross voiced by ming na and her mentor dr sid donald sutherland believe in more organic approach they operate on the notion quoting straight from the press kit that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified and contained aki and dr sid collect series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form wave of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force the waves will in effect cancel each other out and disarm the foreign contagion they have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave they are on desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out are you still with me there only little more aki is infected with the alien force dr sid has developed method of confining the contagion and keeping it from killing her but the defense wall won hold much longer already the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams aiding aki and dr sid are the deep eyes group of hard as nails types that would have felt at home with the troops in aliens capt gray edwards alec baldwin heads the task force that consists of wise guy buscemi tough woman peri gilpin and gentle giant ving rhames throwing monkey wrench into the plans is the requisite dumb ass in this case general hein james woods who wants to use the zeus cannon to bomb the aliens back to the stone age even if it destroys earth as well so there you have it like most of the anime ve seen the plot combines apocalyptic settings lots of shooting and fuzzy spirituality all wrapped up in save the earth bow but bored with apocalyptic settings understand why so many live action films employ them they re cheap but animated films can show anything so why wallow in an industrial trash heap the action scenes and shoot em ups don satisfy either the humans move oddly and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast can bring them to life in fact their efforts merely emphasize what we re missing aki is especially disappointing with her lack of expression and flat delivery she looks and sound like brunet version of weena the eloi girl from 1960 the time machine drab color choices and aliens that appear to have been created in jell molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces students of computer animation may be fascinated with the technology behind final fantasy the spirits within but found it sub par across the board futurama does more effective battle visuals the kids in south park are far more expressive than these mannequins and any old episode of the contemporary version of the outer limits does better doom and gloom sci fi so who needs this not me
plot token director alan smithee steals the only copy of his film trio from the studio after they complete the final cut without him he threatens to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision critique wow really can remember the last time movie sucked on so many levels the comedy in this film is pathetic obvious and dated oj simpson jokes galore the plot is uninteresting boring and bad the structure of the film is annoying repetitive and pretentious the acting is pretty bad especially jackie chan who can act to save his life the cameos are lame and seem forced and the ending blows chunks all in all this movie believes itself to be clever humorous and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood but comes across as boring stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans but this one bites the big one see it if you like to watch really bad movies otherwise skip it because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it luckily for us all this mess only lasts about 80 minutes and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays lead faced detective by the way is there any reason why the studio or the producer couldn have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock that was left over who knows who cares this satire sucks the bag little known facts about this film and its stars ironically the original director of this film arthur hiller also requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the dga alan smithee moniker this was after the film production company cinergi pictures preferred the cut made by producer writer joe eszterhas to his the original script of this film included arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis eszterhas announced through the media during post production that cinergi pictures didn have the money to pay for soundtrack he said that he would finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it to him he received 200 cds and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned artists listened to all that was sent at least couple of tracks from each record and compiled the soundtrack this film practically swept the razzie awards in 1999 given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year with no less than the worst picture award the worst screenplay joe eszterhas the worst supporting actor joe eszterhas the worst new star joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer and the worst original song wanna be mike ovitz as written by joe eszterhas
should have known damn it should have known ewan mcgregor codename eye is pointing high tech rifle ly gadget at fat bald business oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in window across the street we get the requisite electro green through the sight view we the audience seeing high tech rifle ly gadget of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target but instead he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy low quality photographs which eye then proceeds to fax and mail to everyone in his target office all right so thirty seconds in was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle camera but was still open minded maybe there really good reason for it ve got reason to believe you see admire lot of ewan mcgregor previous work and he obi wan ke friggin nobi for god sake and director stephan elliot last movie priscilla queen of the desert was quirky little delight there some genuine talent involved here think at the twenty minute mark there was still spark of hope in my heart eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization son still have no idea what this organization was british intelligence national spy ring private investigation who is apparently stealing from his trust fund he has received his assignment from lang through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase when eye tracks his target to an expensive looking secluded house he witnesses mysterious and beautiful woman ashley judd take knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard ok that odd think to myself this could be interesting then she starts to cry and through her tears exclaims merry christmas dad for the first time so begins our tale of obsession or something the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar throughout his entire professional life he has been voyeur so when he falls for someone the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras fine that lovely premise suppose but gosh darn it if you re going to go there you better have some sort of explanation and that precisely where this film fails this is the kind of movie that pisses me off it an abortion collection of half formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end it pretends it is something that it is not surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in high tech thriller here the filmmakers have confused surreal and deep with vaguely unclear and crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors never even for an instant had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in love with this woman who changes wigs and kills people the movie offers only two explanations neither of which make lick of sense explanation number one the obnoxious presence of eye imaginary daughter who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago tells him he shouldn leave ms judd explanation two which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie beauty is in the eye of the beholder whoo hoo that helps thanks bunch case closed that as deep as it gets folks there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes which instead of tying everything together ends up being as profound as clever sixth grade mad lib there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was my personal favorites include the prison matron modeled after austin powers frau farbissina who apparently taught ms judd everything she knows about wearing wigs jason priestley awfully played dirty desert vagrant #1 who tries to emulate dennis hopper la mavi velvet but fails miserably and the cop who sees ashley fleeing an accident scene and then wants to pay for sex but is shot each one in this sad little parade is little more pointless than the last the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space any time one of the frequent location changes occurs the camera zooms in on souvenir snow globe and minutes weeks or years could have passed bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair one character passes glass of cognac to another in slow motion close up awash in lot of bass ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks then laughs maniacally cut to random guy with eye patch iguana out of focus iguana comes into focus wow man when found out afterward that this film was based on novel it came as no surprise to me there are plenty of elements here that if extended and fleshed out more would have made for decent story and wouldn be surprised if found out there was an hour and half of footage cut from this movie lying in landfill somewhere or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director cut not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such thing to find out what was missing the last ten or so minutes featured conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone and this time didn particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was steaming pile of unholy crap the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what was thinking someone near cell phone guy did eventually yell shut the hell up but it was lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen
it not bad thing to update old stories it done all the time in the oral tradition the difficulty with this film is not that the tale has changed it that it dry the new cinderella danielle drew barrymore is not sitting around waiting for her prince to come she woman of the late twentieth century albeit situated in sixteenth century france when her father dies she stays on in his house even though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla anjelica huston she works by day but reads sir thomas more by firelight at night although the story is updated you know the plot danielle meets prince henry dougray scott goes to ball disguised is later found out and they live happily ever after the movie is often like watching filmed play theater in real life is engrossing theater on the screen is usually lifeless there doesn seem to be much going on the camera can be star of films here it co conspirator danielle convictions are compromised socialist and feminist she pretends to be royalty to get her man kind woman her last act in the movie is one of revenge the most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish the fairy godmother stand in leonardo da vinci patrick godfrey is fun to watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle huston is enjoyable in her over the top wickedness in all fairness my companion loved the film maybe it one of those chick flicks that men don like it is certainly date film nearly the entire audience was couples oh well maybe it good for something
porter stoddard warren beatty is successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie diane keaton for twenty five years they and best friends mona goldie hawn and griffin garry shandling are about to face marital crises in film most well known for its torturous path to the screen town and country town and country has pedigree befitting it title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry the graduate under the direction of peter chelsom funny bones after years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates the media has been prepped for beatty next ishtar so is it that bad the answer is no but it not very good either the major problem with town and country is that it unstructured and random stoddard is immediately established as philanderer having just bedded flaky cellist nastassja kinski next scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin then mona spies griffin hustling redhead into motel and begins divorce proceedings buck henry cameos as both couples divorce lawyer ellie thinks she overeacting but sends porter to support mona on trip to check out her family mississippi manse the two childhood friends end up in bed together making us wonder why they never become couple to begin with back home their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter cheating on her porter goes off on trip with griffin to sun valley idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he gay the four friends along with every woman porter dallied with all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after although the film begins promisingly resembling woody allen take on new york city wasps too many strands drift off into nowhere the stoddard household is huge containing two adult children josh hartnett the virgin suicides and tricia vessey kiss the girls their colorful bedmates and maid who just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of nocturnal snack the six supporting players are dropped except for an out of nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son porter romantic misadventures with women other than mona are equally mishandled once the marital discord begins the film seems as if it was editted with machete stopping and starting never regaining its rhythm while beatty gets off few tart observations his character is mostly passive and bemused maybe we re supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn initiate his own sex romps keaton ellie has trusting nature that result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of the out of towners and the first wives club while shandling relegated to true second banana status kinski is bland and unmotivated andie macdowell takes weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplay most bizarre subplot which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic wheelchair bound foul mouthed mother heston and seldes are fun as is jenna elfman as sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to halloween party oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film nice look but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like hear my song and funny bones the script is this film weakest link it telling that most of the few laughs come from old fashioned physical slapstick and the sight of beatty in bear suit while town and country isn exactly painful to sit through it mostly just lays there
alexander dumas the three musketeers is one of the most often adapted literary works and for good reason the swashbuckler is legend rather than just story perhaps the musketeer new film that reimagines the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix is one adaptation too many it just awful spiritless silly and unforgivably boring transforming the timeless classic into mish mash of old as time clich and incoherent repetitive action sequences this time artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers who can even pronounce his character name as boy he watched his father get killed by febre tim roth lackey of power hungry cardinal richelieu he vowed to have vengeance after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman he goes looking for his enemy on his quest he embroils himself in struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government the royal musketeers have lost their gusto what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal own guards only few loyal swashbuckers remain among them athos and portos who are only figureheads in this movie together with artagnan they fight to extricate the queen catherine deneuve from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant oh and as an afterthought artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn mena suvari just thought mention that now look don know whose idea this was but whoever is responsible deserves severe tongue lashing have nothing against modernizing classic works of literature at the very least they can inspire viewers to actually read the book but films as dull as this have no positive side effects director peter hyams known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas masterwork the sense of excitement cause and camaraderie instead we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing when the musketeers finally get to holler all for one and one for all could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that felt maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams tone which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the reader digest condensed version of the story that he gives us it as though anything that may have been construed as fun was purposely expunged from the production the joylessness of the proceedings from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes can be felt in every frame chambers can act suvari roth and deneuve can but aren given the chance and when push comes to shove the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious though at least roth gets to play villain without having to wear an ape suit some movies seem sloppy and careless clearly made for quick buck with the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful the film is intricate stylish and precise hitting the wrong note every single time
this is an adaptation of wells acclaimed novel the invisible man the actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue the director is paul verhoven that plus quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer should be enough to lure us into the theatre the problem is to keep us there can imagine anyone who would like to see this movie second time working on top secret military project sebastian caine kevin beacon an eccentric genius that calls himself god has discovered the secret to invisibility the first two faces are completed now it is time for the next logical step human caine volunteers for this risky experiment but when he is made invisible something goes wrong while his ex girlfriend linda elisabeth shue desperately tries to find something to return him to normal he learns that invisibility is more of prison than superpower but that not the bad thing an unexpected side effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania he is naturally given couple of modest superpowers just enough for him to survive immolation from flame thrower and an explosion of about quart of nitroglycerine soon every sense of decency is forgotten the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien rip off where caine is walking like half finished terminator spooking scaring and killing everybody though it based on novel called the invisible man the title has been ironically changed to hollow man that sums up the film very nicely this is very silly production laughable actually apparently verhoven imagination doesn stretch too far for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls locker room undetected it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie being invisible gives you the opportunity to be who you are to do what you want without being influenced by society in many ways it gives you an illusion of having life without consequences the nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about all that the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man but since this is modernization in other words dehumanization he doesn stop there he becomes rapist and then of course murderer you ll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place shue talent is barely seen josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully his face is not seen for the most part of the film and the only way he exists is as disembodied voice there are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing in the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place being probably the best technical achievement since jurassic park they are absolutely amazing we observe the layers of skin muscle tissue and bone being peeled away as body is slowly rendered invisible we see beating heart inflating lungs and veins pulsing with newly pumped blood there are couple of inventive shots with smoke fire air and water but are few scenes like that worth attending movie for what is truly disturbing is that with great book talented actors and grand budget this could have been so much more pretty much like jan de bont twister haunting paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary he was responsible for several good films basic instinct and starship troopers and some incredibly bad films showgirls total recall but he has never made anything that was great in way hollow man fits perfectly in this collection it not better or worse than verhoven average film he proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues and so instead of depth and chills verhoven inserts some of his trademarks stupid dialogue and lot of dull action with blood and naked bodies he even throws in some of the worst of film clich the slowly advancing fireball the villain who comes back from the dead etc etc and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year you ll be screaming nooooo and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion and all we can ask is why the answer is simple though hollywood is movie producing machine the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money it has to be about telling stories not marketing them it has to be about transporting us to different place to dazzle us with magic and cleverness to make us care to make us think and feel verhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is proof of that it all flesh and bones but no soul void where its imagination should be
eddie murphy has lot riding on harlem nights as the movie writer director executive producer and star murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails but at the same time he ll receive all of the credit if it succeeds should you sacrifice your hard earned cash to support murphy risky gamble well that depends on whom you trust more me or eddie murphy here what murphy thinks think the audience is expecting good time they gonna get sexy they gonna get funny they gonna get drama they gonna get all of that think it the best movie ve done paramount radio network here what think harlem nights is charmless unoriginal disappointing and almost without question the worst film of the actor career haven seen best defense and guess who to blame the movie problem is not murphy direction harlem nights is fairly good looking film no the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled murphy awful script is the culprit let count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in motion picture yes he even outdoes his own work in raw practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word and after 15 minutes it gets irritating murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast richard pryor redd foxx michael lerner and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from script riddled with stereotypes each of them shines occasionally but basically what we have are good performers stuck in bad vehicle the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life which is really neither here nor there but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 000 movie screens across the country it another matter altogether you re forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff for instance murphy punches della reese in the stomach and he shoots jasmine guy in the head this is mean spirited movie folks lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as common whore but only because she doesn have any scenes with murphy thank god he might have run her over with bulldozer murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date the loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film murphy would rather give his character spiffy wardrobe than spiffy personality sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair the plot is shameless rip off of the sting if you re going to make another sting movie you ve got to do something original murphy tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem circa 1938 fails to add anything new to the formula to get laughs murphy makes fun of stuttering you know comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped murphy idea of drama is scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life for what for shooting reese little toe off needless to say murphy shows little if any promise or imagination as screenwriter in all fairness however few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie danny aiello is fun to watch as dirty cop on the take aiello stands out in the large ensemble cast he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such nasty character racist detective with mob ties aiello zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice another bright spot is arsenio hall who has hilarious show stopping cameo as cry baby gangster hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy in fact hall ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movie unfortunately his character is completely irrelevant to the plot murphy should have given hall much bigger role of course ve already mentioned that didn care for murphy character but have to admit that did love his neckties they are simply spectacular almost worth the price of admission
come on silent bob we re going to hollywood starring jason mewes kevin smith will ferrell shannon elizabeth seann william scott chris rock jason lee ben affleck directed by kevin smith rated jay and silent bob strike back is dumb movie disguised in smarmy interior kevin smith coming off the wonderful challenging dogma fills it with sub road trip gross out jokes and expects us to buy it because he just oh so ironic but when movie is so self aware it becomes about nothing but itself we can hardly be expected to pay for admission jay and silent bob two new jersey stoners who hang out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot have appeared in almost all of smith movies but if not mistaken have not starred in one until now they find out that there is movie based on the comic book that is based on them being made in hollywood this presents two problems they haven received penny in royalties and nerds on the internet what the internet are talking trash about them what is there to do except go to hollywood and stop this movie from being made on the way they re hitchhiking because who knew you needed tickets to take bus they run into group of hotties who pretend to be with an animal rights group but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlie angels style outfits of course they set jay and silent bob up to look like the thieves so that there is massive manhunt going on during the second half of the film will ferrell who again proves himself incapable of doing anything but sketch comedy shows up as the wildlife marshal inspector who thinks the two have stolen monkey the movie will probably please only smith die hard undiscerning fans everyone else will be critical of this mind bogglingly stupid effort following some the sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years past any appeal the movie has will come from the in jokes most of which think understood but the movie is in to the point of absurdity there needs to be something holding it together other than its own smugness once jay and silent bob get to hollywood the movie abruptly switches gears from gross out comedy to ridiculously broad hollywood satire countless hot movie stars and personalities make an appearance from smith veterans matt damon and ben affleck to wes craven but jay and silent bob strike back resorts to such low brow gags as another scream sequel with monkey as the killer get it they re so desperate for another movie they ran out of ideas and used monkey monkey as often happens with writers who are working below what they are actually capable of most of the really good lines are throwaways while the big painstaking gags mostly fall flat one of the funniest lines in the movie flies by when asked to comment on the clitoris don ask jay responds the female clitoris kevin smith is talented writer though agree that his films would be better off if he let real director take the helm and jay and silent bob strike back holds true to his promise to make more facetious film unfortunately it also shapeless pointless and largely unfunny smith verbal trampoline as ben affleck once called his distinctive dialogue takes back seat to his dubious instincts as populist filmmaker this was supposed to be the movie that didn offend anyone but it offensive because it terrible

not sure should be writing review of the witches of eastwick because not sure just what the hell pardon the expression was going on in it however can express the most important observation made of it didn like it if had to summarize this film think conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal that the kernel of it anyway tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women feminism the role of the devil modern reformers and friendship unfortunately little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts they re simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace actually think that most of the audience was even more confused than was they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy on the level of ghostbusters and were bit confused to be getting folk tale with philosophical overtones they laughed or tried to laugh at moments that were either barely funny or much more horrible than funny as if that could bend the film away from it rather frightening direction three women cher susan sarandon and michelle pfieffer live in eastwick small midwestern town one night while drinking late into the evening they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives in seeming answer to their idle daydreams wealthy eccentric moves into mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be he soon shows evidence of mystical perhaps demonic power and his devotion to the women merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones even worse when ignored his moods become ugly and he mistreats the women for spurning him anyway the problems all three female characters are fairly uninteresting and several are cardboard stereotypes especially sarandon character we never get inside them never feel sympathetic to them because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland as for nicholson well even the devil needs direction to go in and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie due to the grace of the screenwriter and more importantly nicholson acting he still can be yanked in one direction and then another without making him little vague and then there the special effects not in themselves they weren that good but their overuse was almost positive until saw the credits that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl because of the big name actors in dopy stunts or stephen spielberg after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholson blown down the street stunt nope it another bunch of guys and directed by george miller who has shown great skill with stunts special effects before the road warrior nightmare at 20 00 feet episode of twilight zone the movie but apparently doesn know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act gawds sake guys this is jack nicholson let him loose let him grin demonically skip the splitting earth and fake lightning watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll all could think of was what waste if you re going to use slapstick like that use it up on pee wee herman nicholson does what he can with the role and when he can find his bearings can be extremely good the scene in the church for instance but most of the time he seems bit stiff as if he not sure what he should be doing next and no wonder this script goes all over the map giving you the feeling that it just love to be allegory but it not sure about what maybe if you give it time it ll think of something so what is the witches of eastwick horror movie folk tale comedy statement about women an examination of the religious right or comparitive morality tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me watching someone regurgitate half digested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms people the screen and ultimately the audience in other words mess $2 00 if you like nicholson enough to watch him here maybe 25% of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others
the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes alas it refers to our heroes as it turns out the alien race that sends computer virus to earth via the mir space station thinks of the human race as virus perhaps even cancer that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further after all we have taken up this entire planet and if they let us live for another billion years or so we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one but the human race doesn have much to worry about after all there woman named foster jamie lee curtis out there stopping the computer virus she the chief navigator on sea vessel travelling with her is captain everton donald sutherland steve baker william baldwin woods marshall bell squeaky julio oscar mechoso and richie sherman augustus they re all sailing in typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters lucky for us we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board the evil captain everton thinks he going to take the ship in and get reward he convinces his crew that there going to be big money so they try to salvage the ship soon however when it apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power they realize that something bad must have happened finally they meet nadia joanna pacula who explains their situation computer virus has taken over the ship it creating bio mechanical life forms to eliminate the human race virus is truly dumb action thriller one of negligible intelligence and innovation when considering the entire film you will realize that it lacks single original scene it direct rip off of nearly every james cameron film aliens the abyss and the terminator films are the most plagiarized more importantly it basically the same movie as last year deep rising liked deep rising simply because it funny it knows it silly and derivative virus takes itself seriously and in the most serious manner possible it steals from every good and bad film of the genre showing you countless familiar scenes and sporting cookie cutter plot that any film of the sci fi horror genre could fit with little trimming but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out okay let me get this straight the alien race which is never really explained is basically sentient electricity they need to make themselves physical so they use space station to get onto ship which is surrounded by water but who cares about that on the ship they make bunch of clunky immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people after that they start using the dead people to create half human half machine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around the leader of course is big creature every film like this has big creature at the end but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around virus is indeed cliched film but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn very threatening it established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there on one level virus is almost passable fun it really gory and few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal the director john bruno worked on lot of cameron films there also nice array of actors even though none of them do any acting except for donald sutherland who does lot of very bad acting the bottom line however is this virus is bad movie it rips off lot of good movies that are worth seeing in that order recommend that you rent any one of the alien films simply to admire the qualities of creature that actually threatens our heroes
depending on who you ask the original sin was either the eating of the apple the act of disobedience against god or the act of betrayal but in case you didn know this don bother remembering it the words original sin never come up in the movie of the same name let alone the concept of it the closest the film even gets to catholicism is in its narrative the story is told by angelina jolie to her priest while on death row in cuba circa 1900 regardless of its senseless title original sin does actually have plot albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war based on the book waltz across darkness boy antionio banderas places personal ad sometime around 1900 searching for wife since this is century ago we narrowly dodge remake of green card only to find that the girl jolie faked her photo and is actually beautiful skipping few moderately useless sex scenes getting the question out of the way yes we get to see angelina jolie breasts again the girl turns out to be con artist swindles boy for his money and heads for the hills original sin then briefly tries to be thriller we see boy go whore chasing saying he wants to find girl and kill her but as soon as boy actually finds girl instead of following what might have been promising or at least not completely fucking boring thriller the film degenerates into the worst dissection of the virgin whore complex since milk money girl toys with the idea of reforming her con girl past all the while avoiding the other man lover that keeps making her start these scams in the first place add insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history literally half of the film is either in slow motion or uses strobe effect and acting roughly the caliber of gun and original sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year don even bother with original sin but if you do go be honest with yourself and admit its pure sex appeal just keep in mind that although this film may not be the most original on the block it much worse than sin this is sacrilege
you know that movie has issues when most everyone in the audience comes out laughing and it not comedy and what strange career path for director chuck russell he starts his career off with decent take on the nightmare on elm street series with his debut as director on installment number three he follows that up with the blob the very next year but waits another six years to do his next piece little film called the mask starring jim carrey and then one more star vehicle in eraser two years after that so then he thought let me wait another five years get weak script jammed with cliches and hope that jimmy smits and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes strange dude and one crappy flick plot six year old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side while the girl aunt wants to well save her from those damn devil worshippers enter one occult expert agent plenty of bobo cops and lots of nuns praying and you ve just about got the gist of things here critique with plot holes the size of my ass this movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich ridden plot with wasted talent cheezy effects bad dialogue and unintentional laughs to boot what good about this movie well rufus sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of creepy runaway children shelter satanist supreme with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around the little girl is also pretty good but unfortunately her character doesn really do all that much and believe it or not was actually enjoying some of the film first half hour which starts off with some promise but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist basinger just drown the film entire basis of believability for some reason it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted and even longer to figure out that every move that she makes is dumb one add that to the entire police force of incompetents save for jimmy smits whose talent agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd mavi would be good career move at least change the clothes jimmy zero scares zero thrills and even less actual drama and you ve got yourself pretty bad movie and why would respected actors like christina ricci and ian holm take bit parts in this movie did they owe the director favor or something together they barely have five minutes of screen time but suppose that ricci hospital room scene might be worth look for some of you horn dogs the worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending which features police officers coming up with the brilliant idea of sneaking up on man house who they know to be guilty of crime uuuhmm how about knocking on the door and arresting his sorry ass officers anyway don usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews but the stupidity of some of these characters is just too difficult to describe without validating it with solid idiotic proof and there was plenty to go around and did basinger lose some of her acting talent during her hiatus from the profession after her 1997 oscar win difficult to say if it was her lines that were really bad or if she just delivered them poorly either way little originality very obvious computer effects little thrills little drama and very little entertainment value certainly bestow the honor of one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film but if you really don mind rehashed gobbledygook of various satanic and kid based thrillers and enjoy watching films that don bring anything new to the table well drink some beers smoke some beans and rent this video because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year
if you have ever seen fox tv special car chase programs you ll have good idea about the content of ronin the new action thriller from director john frankenheimer the film involves mysterious briefcase that several groups of terrorist want to get their hands on an irish women dierdre played by the truman show natascha mcelhone hires group of mercenaries to assist her in getting the briefcase among the people she hires are sam robert de niro vincent jean reno and gregor stellan skarsg rd from good will hunting dierdre groups assignment is too seize the briefcase while the current owners are transporting it they accomplish this task but traitor is in the bunch and the briefcase is soon on the run again the briefcase stays on the run as the movie leads the viewer through several plot twists that are badly executed the writer seemed to be attempting to make smart action movie but failed to understand that just because there are surprises it doesn add too the credibility of senseless script the plot twists get no reaction because they come at time where no one cares what is going on after the apparent climax of the film but to add to the excitement as mentioned earlier there are endless car chase scenes they are unrealistic and fail to add anything to the story don get me wrong love car chases but they were overdone and too long here we never do find out what in the briefcase but doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller
underwater science fiction stays submerged sphere film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman one of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in movie theater is when cast of fine actors end up in film that wastes their talents you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered psychologist norman goodman dustin hoffman is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of plane crash when he arrives at the site he discovers that there is no plane but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years having written paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship his group as outlined in his report consists of beth halperin sharon stone biochemist harry adams samuel jackson mathematician and ted fielding liev schreiber an astrophysicist unfortunately it turns out that the writing was blow off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then colleagues to the team after all he explains who reads government documents lead by harold barnes peter coyote top secret federal operative the group descends to mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel once there they stroll over knock on the door and explore the still operational ufo discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere when adams enters the sphere the weirdness unfolds storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer my name is jerry am happy flashes across the screen this is unsettling for the psychologist what happens if jerry gets mad he asks barnes is more pragmatic he needs last name because he can put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry then the situation turns bad deadly beasts appear from nowhere gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel lethal sea snakes attack goodman giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading 20 000 leagues under the sea the suspicious scientists turn against each other this has all the makings of first rate thinking man science fiction film however even the finest ingredients don go very far in the hands of chief who doesn seem to care about his product director barry levinson has churned out mish mosh that doesn engage the audience beyond few skillful suspense scenes the first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification it much like speed reading novel and realizing that you missed the nuances it doesn get any better when the action scenes begin while the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles the people are still flat oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them after adams experiences the interior of the sphere no one bothers to ask him what happened their history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited even goodman and halperin ill conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing her psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing there truism that items shown early in movie must be used before the ending but here they are far too obvious when an emergency mini sub is explained you know what going to happen the movie affectations are nothing more than distracting chapter headings that divide the movie have no function the shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos much of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow although some of the disorientation eventually is understandable great deal of it isn even science fiction film must be internally consistent there too much here that doesn make sense are the manifestations real the jellyfish kill queen latifa in throw away role and the squid nearly destroys the outpost but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect scene in the sub suggests that it illusion but earlier episodes indicate that it not not everything has to be explained to death but there are major questions that the film never answers where the ship came from is clarified but how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to even the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll the climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale after pre release audience testing the actors were called back to re shoot the ending it difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse following the recent tradition of lengthy films this weighs in at over two very long hours the weak scenes could have been cut but then there wouldn have been much left the movie was supposedly held up by effects work but there nothing special on the screen we never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm stealing from alien the abyss and the disastrous event horizon this film has learned nothing from them remarkably levinson and hoffman other currently showing film is wag the dog smart and entertaining piece of work this one could have been titled the same sans one word
renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean claude van damme on the action star 1997 pairing with dennis rodman _double_team_ and managed to make what initially appeared to be disaster into slick stylish and somewhat diverting action timekiller tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels _knock_off_ but this time around style neither save script that is at best ridiculous and at worst incomprehensible nor hide host of truly lousy performances writer steven desouza fairly straightforward plotline isn as outre as _double_team_ strange yarn involving secret think tank prison but it makes about as much sense which is little van damme plays marcus ray hong kong based sales rep for jeans company who stumbles upon russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip sized bombs in hk product exports to the dolls electronic equipment and yes jeans it all part of some type of ransom scheme but all remember is and kid you not graphics on cia computer screen showing map of the world bombs detonating and an hat wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter which is what the crowd at the showing attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ while all of van damme films have its share of unintentional laughs mostly due to the stiff acting skills of the physically agile van damme _knock_off_ delivers more than usual though not as many as van damme embarrassing directorial effort 1996 _the_quest_ lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza smoked that badass like roman candle and entrepreneurship babycakes standing out among my favorites but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_ laughs van damme is true to laughable form perhaps even worse than usual early scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co star rob schneider improbably cast as deep cover cia agent posing as marcus business partner and the sight and sound of the still heavily accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider cia superior and lela rochon playing an investigator for the jeans company spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode in rochon defense though her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs exquisite bone structure and perky bosoms the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage tsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_ juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work here though tsui visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise for each nifty trick tsui pulls off such as recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices there are others that are completely superfluous this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context for instance one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in box as he puts his hand in the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in rectangle at the corner of the screen it undoubtedly an interesting visual but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something the test of van damme movie boils down to the action sequences but surprisingly those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired tsui does what he can to make something of them employing freeze frames blurred motion and unconventional camera angles but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza there isn anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger land mine fight in _double_team_ let alone anything remotely close to tsui legendary hong kong works but that given going in if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo stateside success he would do best to break free from van damme before it too late if he continues his involvement with grade movies such as _knock_off_ the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish that is if it hasn already disappeared entirely after this fiasco
robin williams has the rarest of gifts the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style overwhelmingly his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best with the notable exception of flubber so when the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams tell you that not even williams can save his latest project you know it in trouble jakob the liar is confused muddled little movie generically uplifting film with fundamental contradiction the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn realize it williams plays jakob haim jew imprisoned in polish ghetto during world war ii one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of high ranking german officer for his punishment jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of radio broadcast the announcement in english but punctuated by triumphant heil hitler is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob ghetto liberation he thinks the next day jakob tells the news to his closest friend volatile prize fighter named misha liev schreiber who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along soon it is common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has radio hidden in his home crime punishable by death this is absurdly false but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate the danger of course is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger in curiously irrelevant subplot jakob finds 11 year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered and goes to great length to make sure of that just why the idea frightens him is never made clear he and the girl build an uninvolving generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren met the results are far worse than if there was no hope that the film biggest detriment it is based on false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false it never moving because it doesn give us anything to be moved by jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing robin williams doesn inject the film with life as matter of fact he seems little out of it as if crippled by his fake accent he is stragely unenthusiastic his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless hopeless not since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent this isn the robin williams we know and love in good will hunting he became serious actor and won an oscar for it here he is more of wannabe serious actor an impostor jakob the liar will be compared with last year life is beautiful because it is being marketed as holocaust comedy it not comedy it tries sometimes but it rarely works is it melodrama war movie character study no no and no jakob the liar is the kind of movie that can be placed into category not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts
holy man boasts sweet gentle comic performance from an unusually subdued eddie murphy and few moderately funny skits unfortunately to get to the good stuff you have to sit through painfully long set up loads of tedious filler interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering and twitching superfluous romantic subplot and quite possibly the most annoying performance of robert loggia career if ever movie screamed wait for video so you can fast forward through all the dull and annoying parts this is it eddie murphy plays robed nomadic pilgrim wandering the land enjoying the moment and spreading his spiritual message chance meeting with ricky hayman goldblum stressed out executive of home shopping channel and kate newell kelly preston no nonsense media analyst results in physical injury to quicker than you can say the odd couple ends up rooming with an extremely leery ricky after some script gymnastics appears live on the air at the good buy shopping network wreaking havoc on the cheesy product demonstrations enraging network owner mr mcbainbridge loggia and becoming national media sensation holy man attempts to be several things at once it tries to satirize home shopping networks but it difficult to effectively make fun of something that is already self parody the film attempts to teach us that collecting material possessions is merely futile attempt to fill the spiritual holes in our hearts but that common knowledge already holy man also tries to present story of redemption as ricky hayman tries to decide whether to exploit good will to achieve financial security or do the right thing at the expense of his career anyone want to place wager on his final decision the one genuine asset in holy man is eddie murphy who gives charming performance sharing love good will and relevant advice to all those around him while beaming his million dollar smile at just the right moments murphy is delightful and the film takes off whenever he onscreen unfortunately he not onscreen enough jeff goldblum gets the lion share of screen time and his tired storyline weighs the proceedings down as his potential love interest kelly preston tries to brighten things up but she transforms from an all business media shark to an empathic softy far too quickly and the abrupt change reeks of contrivance the other principal actor robert loggia wastes his talents in one note turn as ruthless screaming monster structurally unsound and way too long holy man is appealing when murphy is onscreen and dull when he isn instead of dropping your money at the theater for this trifle wait until it hits video and fast forward past everything except the murphy scenes suggests that we focus on enjoying the moment and that the best way to do so
ripe with explosions mass death and really weird hairdos tsui hark double team must be the result of tipsy hollywood power lunch that decided jean claude van damme needs another notch on his bad movie bedpost and nba superstar dennis rodman should have an acting career actually in double team neither performance is all that bad ve always been the one critic to defend van damme he possesses high charisma level that some genre stars namely steven seagal never aim for it just that he never made movie so exuberantly witty since 1994 timecop and rodman well he pretty much rodman he extremely colorful and therefore he pretty much fits his role to even if the role is that of an ex cia weapons expert it the story that needs some major work van damme plays counter terrorist operative jack quinn who teams up with arms dealer yaz rodman to rub out deadly gangster stavros mickey rourke all beefy and weird looking in an antwerp amusement park the job is botched when stavros son gets killed in the gunfire and quinn is taken off to an island known as the colony think tank for soldiers too valuable to kill but too dangerous to set free quinn escapes and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife natacha lindinger but stavros is out for revenge and kidnaps her so what kickboxing mercenary to do quinn looks up yaz and the two travel to rome so they can rescue the woman kill stavros save the world and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do with crazy often eye popping camera work by peter pau and rodman lite brite locks double team should be mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure but too much tries to happen in each frame and the result is movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated the numerous action scenes are loud and headache inducing and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about what going on in the movie and much of what going on is just wacky there whole segment devoted to net surfing monks that have yet to figure out and the climax finds quinn going head to head with tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on motorcycle trying to avoid running over land mines and hold on to quinn baby boy who in bomb equipped basket all this while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers did mention double team is strange when it all comes down this is just another rarely entertaining formula killathon albeit one that feels no need to indulge in gratuitous profanity rodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona though leading up to stunt where he kicks an opponent between the legs but we didn need double team to tell us he could do that did we
you think that after awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out of video games it hasn worked so far street fighter super mario brothers wing commander mortal kombat not watchable film in the bunch still held out some hope for tomb raider after all the game premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy and all the mummy movies so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept however despite the potential of the project tomb raider proves to be yet another bomb the plot is convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from dozen bad movies there once ever 5000 years alignment of planets coming up and the illuminati have to find both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order to take over the world of course the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world our heroine lady lara croft angelina jolie finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father jon voight dug up she figures that if she gets the triangle she can bring her dad back from the dead of course no one was expecting much of plot from this movie anyway in both video games and action movies the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences however the action in tomb raider shows little style or originality there lots of shooting and some kung fu fightin but none of it progresses beyond the level of cheap direct to cable flick the other goofy archeologist flick of the summer the mummy returns was much better it had its flaws but its action was creative and large scale since winning her academy award for girl interrupted jolie hasn taken any projects that would display her acting talents tomb raider seems to be more interested in displaying her breasts so much attention is drawn to them that it shame there no oscar for best performance by wonderbra while we don see much of her acting ability with the exception of wonderful upper crust british accent we do get hint of jolie less savory side considering the rumors of incest that hang over jolie and her supposed obsession with death having lara be obsessed with resurrecting her dead father and uninterested in any of the living males around her seems poor choice having jolie real life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier haven decided what to make of director simon west yet his first feature was the star studded disaster con air but my opinion of him improved with the general daughter which was thick with sultry atmosphere now this train wreck hope he improves again because his next project is the big screen version of the cult tv series the prisoner hollywood has already screwed up the avengers and the prisoner represents chance for redemption by the way speaking of british tv kirmizi dwarf fans should look for chris rimmer barrie in his first major film role
despite its exceedingly well done visual effects 1995 original species was one big hunk of sci fi cheese from the writing to the feeble performances so coming from such grade roots its sequel stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising yet at the same time it is it would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad if not even worse something is clearly amiss when the back door left open for sequel in species sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating body part from the exploded alien human hybrid sil is never entered into perhaps that was left for species iii though not giving away anything when say that this installment has an open back door of its own the alien fun and games begin this time when three person astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain patrick ross justin lazard late of cbs short lived soap of few years back central park west cpw this alien dna is not identical to that which created the original film sil but it close enough and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find meanwhile scientist dr laura baker the returning marg helgenberger has created clone of sil named eve natasha henstridge again for research purposes it doesn take long for eve to sense another alien presence which send her libido into hyperdrive it up to laura and her former partner bounty hunter press lennox michael madsen another returnee and patrick uninfected shipmate dennis gamble mykelti williamson to find patrick before the in heat eve does this isn the files goddammit exclaims one character in the early going in terms of quality he absolutely right but he also wrong the new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick pupils to dilate once he infected looks and sounds an awful lot like the files siyah cancer to me but that not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from species was already ripoff of alien but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the original director roger donaldson did human patrick is given tongue that also has tongue within itself and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve alien body which ironically was designed by alien designer giger large alien hive that our heros douse with substance fired from large guns aliens sans flamethrowers the visual effects were by far the best thing about species and the sequel effects crew at steve johnson xfx inc keeps that high quality tradition alive no cheap looking lost in space cgi here after the effects the original best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge however medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment at one point she called on to play alien empath la forest whitaker in the original but for most of the duration she holed up in glass cell by the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place the film is well into its home stretch so the rest of the time we are treated to patrick played with little zest by lazard one problem with the first film was that the deadly horny but innocent at heart sil was too sympathetic no such problem with patrick who comes off as cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control the rest of the cast also fails to add much but the writing can be faulted for that helgenberger and madsen go through the motions but they are already hampered by the clich development that somewhere between the two films the once linked laura and press stopped getting along williamson suffers the worst indignity he tries his best to enliven the token african american role but how can anyone recite insulting derivative lines such as gonna get african on someone ass and not appear ridiculous but species ii worst crime is being thoroughly uninteresting piece of work at least the original featured plenty to laugh at unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker and the sight of helgenberger character performing fellatio on madsen for start but the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level for all the blood and gore nudity and sex thrown in species ii is quite simply vapid bore
deep rising gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively not only does the movie take place on cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by squid like menace but the unfolding story is artificial silly and almost completely derivative of countless other and for the most part better films while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures take for example the schlocky mountain highs of last spring anaconda deep rising has no tongue to put in its cheek folks we re only month into the new year and already here candidate for one of its stinkiest releases most of the action takes place on the argonautica luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage uh oh if these people had seen titanic then maybe they have known to stay home when it attacked by giant tentacled sea creature the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian famke janssen argonautica owner canton anthony heald and few other crew members mercenary team lead by resourceful captain john finnegan treat williams board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby but what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood soaked hungry and not very helpful the main problem with deep rising is its overt familiarity the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci fi horror films in recent memory the concept is leviathan meets titanic with dash of speed thrown in for good or is that bad measure this monster is equal parts 20 000 leagues under the sea and the relic knows how to open doors like the raptors from jurassic park and even gets to expel half digested victim neat effect admittedly la the giant snake in anaconda some of the attack sequences are straight out of jaws and alien scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of alien resurrection there even jet ski chase like hard rain and the list goes on watching deep rising cast battle the beast is murky chore in itself because none of them have well developed characters nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy williams is affable enough but his finnegan just isn believable an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted pretty famke janssen best known as goldeneye killer thighs is trapped in forced romantic interest with williams while kevin connor as finnegan mechanic provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast djimon honsou who received raves for his performance as noble slave in december amistad pops up in brief part he needs to stay away from the water the movie final shot is groaner as is the 11th hour regurgitation of subplot involving an on ship saboteur as if cast deserving of their snack food fate isn bad enough when you taunt the monster you re really asking for it deep rising is slow stupid slog through story without single bright spot and since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is the closer we are to the end of the movie rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn out of the question
after the huge success of the exorcist in 1973 sequel was inevitable and sadly like most horror fims that make money the filmmakers decided to make ridiculous sequel that makes absolutely no sense at all and to me was extremely pointless wasting linda blair and max von sydow completely needless dumb sequel flopped in the box office and never gained much success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time to which agree with to start the story it is four years later and regan is being tormented by memories of what used to be now priest played by richard burton is trying to figure out why this demon tried to possess regan and now the demon somehow wants to possess her again maybe she was good or something now they must try to stop this demon from taking over regan body before it is too late some of the bad things exorcist ii has in it is linda blair she had no need to revive her character and she is really terrible in this film she brings it down to lull and in places it seems like it just stops in its place and doesn go anywhere louise fletcher is alright for what it worth but she could have done lot better than this the direction by john boorman is that of confused stylish nature that really couldn figure out in fact had no idea what was going on in this film the script was jumbled the plot was jumbled and the ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad for those exorcist fans who haven seen this one recommend renting it actually gave this one high rating if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins went easy on it however because of the fact that it has bit of good direction but nothing else im not saying like the film now so dont start going anywhere bad bad bad movie
ve always been kevin kline fan silverado fish called wanda pirates of penzance and even his hamlet on pbs great performances the minute saw the trailer for this film resolved to see it besides the fact that kline starred it looked like hilarious film got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent however as also thought wow if there this much funny stuff in the trailer there must be ton of laughs in the rest of the film oops packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo my name for our local multi multi plex the film began the film concerns an english drama teacher at suburban high school named howard brackett he loves poetry and great literary works but his class is more interested in his famous former student played by matt dillon put in his name but my wife won let me take notes during movie and ve forgotten it they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him brackett has been engaged to another teacher played by joan cusack for three years and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her the wedding however becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is homosexual kline spends most of the first two thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference his closest friends don help matters bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party there are some genuinely hilarous moments one involving tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity kline is hounded by gay reporter played by tom selleck who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations the movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding kline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows if you want to be surprised don read am going to reveal the ending instead of saying do in front of his parents and most of the town and even some cameras he says gay this is where the movie in my opinion falls apart most of the humor in the film had come from kline insistence that he was straight while at the same time loving poetry and being senstivie guy dressing well and occaisionally acting prissy it reminded me of the effeminate heterosexual sketch from saturday night live it was funny it was sustainably funny and kline performance made it doubly so however after the wedding the film drags on they should have attempted to come to quick conclusion but it then gets into the serious side of what he done he reconciles with his parents and his friends some of which had turned on him there are several scenes which seemed like waste of time the scene with his mother and her friends which was hilarious seemed pointless and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless finally even though am not catholic found the scene with the priest to be condescending the preist cannot believe that man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship proclaiming to brackett in the third person he gay it got chuckle from the audience but was distracted by it and began to tire of the film by the time the wedding had come and gone found myself hoping it would be over soon much like this review you are saying overall if have to quantify it say rising action gets and climax and falling action gets see it in economy time
in double jeopardy the stakes are high think of the plot as rehash of sleeping with the enemy and then rearrange the details and the gender of the stalker the finished product although able to maintain the viewer attention is predictable and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script `alex ll take homicide for $400 libby parsons ashley judd is happily married mom leading normal life one night her husband nick bruce greenwood takes her out for romantic escape on sailboat libby awakens in the middle of the night to find she is covered in blood and nick has strangely disappeared she follows trail of bloody footprints up to the deck where she handles fallen knife like any stupid character and is spotted by the coast guard who are responding to distress signal sent earlier in the evening nick is presumed dead and although she pleads her innocence libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband now please don think spoiling any vital plot details because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans if you haven seen this preview don read any further but seriously the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg and douglas cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters during the most vital scenes in the movie was anticipating every twist or `surprise that eventually popped up on the screen imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is very naive group of individuals most unfortunately will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production one is tommy lee jones who plays travis lehman parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison jones is always wonderful as an authority figure and he certainly familiar with this sort of role as he played so well in the fugitive and us marshals judd as likable heroin with gusto also has chance to flex her acting abilities while emotionally unconvincing the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role perking up the movie like an injection of anti depressant the actors and their relationship together present the one two punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely and now back to the plot while behind bars libby learns an interesting little bit of information person can be convicted of the same crime twice this law called `double jeopardy could be her motive for hunting down her husband who may still be alive yes you heard right the movie degenerates into cross country chase where everything you expect to happen does the final scenes which could have redeemed the film are poorly handled by director bruce beresford whose previous work centers highly around drama driving miss daisy paradise road ironically it is those elements like the driving force of libby to reunite with her son that don quite work here at least double jeopardy is paced well enough to satisfy diehard fans of the two stars unfortunately jones lacks some of the edge that he had as sam gerard in the fugitive and the real depth of his character is only skin deep but he and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material and both have some memorable comic moments judd in particular has hilarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has to check in with her `parole officer hmmm perhaps this would have made good comedy it is disappointing because there are the makings of competent action film here it nicely shot and choreographed in downtown vancouver and will entertain those who aren turned off by the woeful story line tis shame that double jeopardy is an adult thriller that wouldn fool most children

have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series if there will there way and believe that anything no matter how great or revered can be effectively improved upon this is the reason that responded so well to gus van sant universally panned update of psycho thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience but also very on par with an original but do have big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad you see the point of remake is or at least it should be to iron out the original flaws and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection but what if the source material on which the remake is based isn any good to begin with that is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner the mod squad ve only seen couple episodes of the late 60s tv series on which it is based and to be honest didn like it all that much it has concept that and still is interesting group of corrupt young adults all in their early 20s are given choice they either go to jail for the various crimes that they all have committed or they can become undercover cops helping the police get into places that they normally wouldn be able to access obviously all opt for the latter option and become undercover policemen and policewomen the three main characters here are played by claire danes omar epps and giovanni ribisi of the three only danes has real character ribisi dumbass 20 year old is played exclusively for laughs epps slightly more intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes when the squad superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death the three of them sure that their beloved master was framed go off and investigate on their own discovering corrupt cops lots and lots of expensive whores and very lucrative drug operations all kinds of good stuff the only times that the mod squad comes even close to working is in its comedic moments although ribisi is trite actor and his characters repeat movie after movie his man here is really rather amusing when the script gives him chance epps straight man is effectively played against ribisi clueless spontaneity but the rest of the film is dull boring and singularly uninteresting drug op action plot is no longer anything new not even with teenage action heroes and the way it executed here it also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful claire danes character has potential but it is buried under heaps of cliches and her performance is too restrained she could have been tour de force but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role epps and ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected although their characters aren nearly as rich as danes could have been the mod squad is mind numbing marketing plot of film and teens will jump all over it it full of bad dialogue scenes and concepts that make no sense and get this drug dealers that like to tango with other guys in their spare time nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for claire danes is no longer alluring mainly because she got horrible hairdo so that draw is out there are however cool explosions guns and chases which may lure viewer into thinking that he or she is about to experience an exciting thriller of some sort do not be fooled some may call this escapist fare call it escape as quickly as you can fare
miramax disinvited on line media from press screenings of scream they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler filled reviews and post them prior to the film february 4th release date unsound reasoning you see net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionals miramax surely knows the difference between member of the on line film critics society ofcs and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain it cool news no the mini major was afraid we let bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit that scream is dismal conclusion to the beloved by this writer at least franchise something smells rotten in the state of california right from the get go cotton weary liev schrieber the former lover and would be killer of maureen prescott sidney mother is juggling phone calls in his luxury car once considered danger to society weary now hosts his own talk show 100% cotton clever if dated jab at american pop culture of course new ghostface dials him up and with memories of scream unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind we immediately wonder where is the killer the backseat the next car thrilling prospects to be sure but actually ghostface is at the weary residence waiting for cotton girlfriend kelly rutheford to finishing showering what missing from this sequence and indeed scream remaining frights most disappointingly the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes one of which might spring to life is an elaborate and attenuated payoff our other surviving regulars have become estranged sidney campbell is living paranoid existence of electronic gates and password protected locks while dewey arquette acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream movie within movie stab and gale weathers cox arquette headlines gossipy news program murder reunites them as knife wielding ghostface stalks the set of stab imitating its sadistic screenplay and his her their own personal draft climaxes with sidney death the appeal of ghostface villainy is that he she they could be your boyfriend your classmate your next door neighbour or combination of people scream was the first of its kind slasher mystery with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next but also who is are the perpetrator and what is are his her their motive ironic self reflection aside parts one and two stand out in crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume with scream the novelty of ghostface ever mutating identity has worn off some but the character remains conceptually potent conceptually the execution of ghostface master plan this time around is creaky because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we come to understand in scream and scream the movie gets in the silly habit of saying all bets are off in reference to the rules of trilogy third act but there difference between rule breaking and cheating with the departure of kevin williamson who authored the previous screams as well as tidy outline for scream that for reasons incomprehensible to me was ignored save the notion of stab kruger needed to be reined in tighter and by wes craven craven direction of scream is lazy in most respects how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo the slacker duo of kevin smith movies akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny it pains me to write this but scream comedy is generally laughless with the exception of well timed performances by josh pais as police detective possessed of the same personality he had as persnickety teacher in craven music of the heart jamie kennedy resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream and parker posey through sheer force of will as actress the visuals are much weaker in part three as well the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming camera is pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before aside in the wake of columbine craven toned down the violence significantly for scream why the sanctimony when scream and scream are still readily available on video store shelves finally marco beltrami music cues the suspense too blatantly do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream it mostly silent sting notes are whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere here they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve jangling score look at scream as coming from an alternative universe the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii woefully out of synch with its prequels scream is nightmare instead of nightmarish and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of trilogy to part three must disappoint
way of the gun is brimming with surprises some good most bad one of the good ones is ryan phillippe surprisingly halfway decent performance after the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like know what you did last summer he hinted at bit growth in last year cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark precisely when the screenplay made his character grow heart presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans and start bellyaching about how he fallen for his target it was dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film director could negotiate but he seems to be trying and that shouldn be overlooked or probably over praised seeing as how at this point he really isn required to do much but look pretty here phillippe has procured five day growth of beard his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his look here see glory it tough to believe pretty boy like phillippe as hard ass but his performance actually helps with the illusion unlike ben affleck puppy dog approach in reindeer games phillippe is believable and not too bad at that as for the plot well that one of the bad surprises phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic and not even remotely likeable criminals introduced to us in the parking lot of rave where they stupidly pick fight with about twenty people who hatch scheme to kidnap surrogate mother juliette lewis after overhearing that she carrying the baby of painter scott wilson very well connected wealthy man the kidnapping devolves into laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed but the anti heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man james caan and two scheming bodyguards taye diggs and nicky katt remain in pursuit directed by christopher mcquarrie the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles this one included way of the gun is hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity unlike phillipe mcquarrie doesn seem to be growing at all he fills his flick with sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies know ve seen before and worse it feels like it the film lacks even fresh approach like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey to its clich all of which are spewed before us in picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is it features characters living by code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have cup of coffee and pontificate on life philosophy etc didn like the bit much when it first appeared in heat here it even more self consciously dramatic usual suspects which also featured bunch of low lives that seemed to live by code they learned from the movies worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending nowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential thus nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret most amateurishly projected before they appear and it too has an ironic little twist at the end nothing earth shattering like in the usual suspects but admit didn see it coming and smiled however most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason or substance it just as overplotted as suspects and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters distinctive style or good script would be even the good stuff most of which involves james caan doing fine job feels odd and out of place in movie that thinks lines like karma is only justice with out the satisfaction are clever at one point caan laments need is the ultimate monkey line so inexplicable he might as well have said love is like hippo ass ve seen porno with better dialogue and some with better plot lines too but rarely has porn offered up such talented cast mean can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy caan slips into this role with seeming ease he could do this kind of soft spoken tough guy in coma but he manages to give his character depth and weariness benicio del torro is always welcome though here he plays it fairly straight rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage adopting brad pitt esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering speaking of pitt his ex juliette lewis is weak link either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness or waddling about like silly goose nicky katt was brilliant in brief role in the limey here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted he only kept around for his cold presence taye diggs has similar function cool as ever but never character though the guy has one helluva death scene for the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give hippo ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns it vaguely tarantino ish but in bad truth and consequences nm way with phillippe in one scene leaping into stupid rant about faggots migrating to los angeles you know the routine the final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at but those gun shots sure crack like thunder just the other day was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt like sound that emanated from harry fetishized smith and wesson oh how far we ve come
where do begin okay how about with this starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in long time in fact it might even be the worst major release film to come out in years or even decade this is bad beyond belief would not suggest paying money to see this there good chance you ll regret it if you see it for free you could still want to walk out go right ahead the movie starts off with cheesy 90210 scenes set in the future world of buenos aires here we meet the group of horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious easy to despise with passion characters that have love triangles love rectangles and love hexagons screwing up their life before long they all go off and join the military primarily in the interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined they train they strut around nude for no reason whatsoever after an hour of making the audience scream in agony they start fighting bugs the big bugs look nice even though their design is only okay unfortunately the fights are boring since we want all of the characters dead anyway cue more agony then some characters have sex then some more die who cares cue more agony the movie ends the audience runs out to their cars vomits over the pavement and attempts to drive home unfortunately after that torture they can think straight don pay attention to the road and many are in ugly car wrecks you remember how batman robin was bad well batman robin kicked this movie sorry butt people starship troopers does not succeed as an action movie it does not succeed as drama it does not succeed as war movie it does not succeed as comedy it does not succeed as satire it does not succeed as parody it succeeds as being horrible terrible gut wrenchingly bad wanted to run away from that movie every minute but paid my money and owed it to others to see if the movie got any better so stayed it never got better frequently it did the impossible and got worse the movie as written acted directed and basically just feels as whole like it about on the mental maturity level of free willy the whole thing feels like movie that only three year olds could enjoy except for the ridiculously gratuitous blood and gore and pointless nudity it written for little children but children should definitely not go anywhere near it of course recommend the same for everyone don go anywhere near it verhoeven got streak going now his last movie was showgirls he seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop coming showgirls was failure but it appears that though it ll be lucky to make near its budget this movie will still do okay gross wise is it really all bad well no troopers has about four or five lines of dialouge short humorous scenes that are actually funny mostly from the do you want to know more commercials that pop up throughout the story promoting the joys of the joining the troopers so that adds up to about 30 seconds of entertainment and still about one hour 59 minutes and 30 seconds of miserable torture totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movie but do admit it so if you re willing to possibly put yourself through torture go ahead and see it and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it don know how anyone or any thing could love this movie but hey to each his own feel free to give it shot of course in the interest of saving your souls don recommend it but guess what alien resurrection comes out november 26th and having already seen some of it and having read the script assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away though opinion on starship troopers is reasonably split it ll be difficult to find someone that won like alien resurrection when they ve seen it this is possibly the year best intense action film or at least one of the best if you really want to see alien warfare that played out intelligently and seriously see alien resurrection please avoid this
the best thing in fact the only good thing can say about dark city is that it made me want to go see confidential again or go rent body heat to see william hurt do some real noir or even god help me palmetto alex proyas new movie screams atmosphere screamed too get me out of this theater new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors and doesn have any way to get it back paid $4 25 for matinee screening and don have any way to get my money back either you ll hear lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create stunning nightmarish future world where it always late night in 1948 complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras ve got news for you fellows don care how hard you worked or how visually stunning this movie looks you wasted your time and mine working on movie without plot without clear sense of direction of where it wanted to go without soul or reason to care the movie starts out oh so promising john murdoch rufus sewell is lying in bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life would have been boarded up long ago there is dead mutilated prostitute in the other room surprise as he has lost his memory the phone rings it sinister sounding man claiming to be his doctor telling him to flee for his life all well and good right wrong apparently someone decided that the audience was just bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot this is getting to be popular assumption in hollywood so the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life rather it voice over narration by the aforementioned doctor keifer sutherland explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible it as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca no wait that not fair to casablanca it more like watching new plotline at the first of the show or if you want to know how really feel having an off screen narrator explain that gilligan won be getting off the island in this episode >from here the coherence of the plot goes down faster than insert monica lewinsky joke here the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason and that what moves the plot what we re left with is string of unanswered questions that don make any sense we re given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed we re given hero who can tune into these same powers yet he only uses them when it convenient to the plot we re given whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere usually critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part isn given much to do in this movie no one is given anything to do sewell is given the impossible role of man who doesn remember anything and plays it like um man who doesn remember anything the aliens are tall pasty faced and bald and wear long siyah cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they re evil and there child alien as well straight out of an anne rice novel sutherland is saddled with limp twitchy eye and breathy accent to remind us that he in league with the aliens to its credit dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting william hurt is perfectly cast as the world weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city jennifer connelly playing sewell love interest is given two all too brief moments on screen as lounge singer and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit but instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script the way they would be in any self respecting noir movie they re almost tangiential to the plot such as it is the problem with dark city is this it bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir the essence of film noir isn as proyas seems to beleive breathy dialogue or snap brim fedoras or tall bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in corner dark city has not one bit of intrigue moral ambiguity suspense or anything else that keeps us coming back to the noir classics dark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic it an exceptionlly well made and intricately designed piece of flotsam sailing around and around the middle of the ocean going nowhere
american pie is filled with laughs but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for locker room than movie theater no prude and admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself what separates american pie from its predecessor is heart of the original noted it was warm pleasant outing about the travails of growing up well the quartet of chums jim jason biggs oz chris klein kevin thomas ian nicholas and finch eddie kaye thomas have grown up at least they are year older but don seem any wiser fresh from their first year of college the quartet along with the obnoxious stifler seann william scott rent summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score as usual nothing goes right until the last reel but what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women and american pie is rather degrading to women for the most part they are not shown as individuals they are nothing more than potential recipients of over active raging hormones it is telling that the most normal couple oz and heather mena suvari spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex she overseas on an exchange student program despite having been to college jim is still klutzy and awkward unsure of himself around the opposite sex most of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him including painful episode involving an instant glue like substance also uncomfortable to watch is sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates whom the boys suspect of being lesbians it is offensive and plays upon outdated adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs the first film despite some raunchy moments had an innocent charm to it the sequel is more cynical it knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them the many mentions of finch encounter with stifler mom becomes tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy return as jim well meaning trying to be hip dad the only performer who is actually given some new fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle the band geek from the original in the sequel she imbues her character with vulnerability wisdom and maturity american pie is pre sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office it is shame though that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz who also penned the original could not have set his sights higher american pie is funny but it still comedown as well as letdown
well what are you going to expect it movie about big snake that eats people that what should have been thinking when viewed this film because maybe then would have enjoyed myself more instead ended up wishing giant snake would come along and eat me too anaconda is about documentary film crew sailing down south american river led by anthropologists dr steven cale eric stolz and terri flores jennifer lopez the crew is attempting to locate lost tribe of natives along the way they find poacher paul sarone jon voight and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda to simply say that this is the world largest snake wouldn be doing it justice since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide if this isn good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers don know what is at the beginning of anaconda we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past but that seems to be more or less over now expected that fact to play key part somewhere down the line but it ended up being set up for nothing cale chokes on deadly wasp don ask me how that happens don know and is put out of action relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help this minimally helps to add sense of urgency for the plot since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone plan to capture the snake however this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle most bad characters are either annoying or stupid in this movie they re both since this description applies to all the characters except sarone it hard to find someone to root for you re supposed to back the good guys but you really end up cheering for sarone because he smarter than everyone else or maybe he just not as dumb as everyone else at times almost found myself rooting for the snake there are no standout performances here everyone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters even voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason no matter as in most monster movies the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway in most of the scenes the snake is computer generated and the effects crew did decent job of making it look real however the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences sometimes for example the snake just moves too fast it catches guy jumping off of waterfall for crying out loud then there another scene where the snake eats one of the characters and we see the snake skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim pained expression from within the snake belly absolutely ridiculous testimony to the film bad direction is the inclusion of scene early on the in the film where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is in scene totally unrelated to anything else we are witness to the big snake winning showdown with panther the anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard one of the panther eyeballs pops out eeeewwwww above and beyond the sick factor however this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before quarter of the movie had even passed in films like these sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained if the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them to show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don know about and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown in case like that the showdown just ends up being letdown when saw the snake for the first time decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake saw wasn the real danger this one was just decoy and there was actually bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe no such luck okay maybe anaconda is actually decoy and there really better movie waiting to make its debut
midway through anaconda documentary filmmaker terri flores jennifer lopez turns to co worker and says thought this movie would be my first big break instead it turned into disaster truer words have never been spoken anaconda is monster movie with lousy monster it suspense film that is utterly predictable it mess the film does manage to drum up some scares but only in the most elementary way like jack in the box as you turn the crank you re totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up but somehow it still mildly startling when it happens the main difference between the giant snake in anaconda and the clown in jack in the box is that the clown is more realistic anaconda boasts some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe inducing robots you ve endured at disney world but it the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame in one shot character tries to flee from the monster by diving from tree near waterfall but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air the scene if done well would have been jaw dropper here the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than saturday morning cartoon what really amazing is that the filmmaker were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie but enough about the phony snakes now it time to talk about the lousy story heroic and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads documentary film crew down brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest stoltz tells his crew pray that you didn forget your bug spray apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no ill effect along the way the group rescues whacked out lapsed priest jon voight who claims to know how to find the shirishama within minutes they throw away all their plans and follow voight down tributary into the land of creepiness from that point on the film is hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from jaws and dead calm one of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of eric stoltz early in the story his character gets knocked into coma by river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious so why did they hire an actor of the caliber of stoltz for what amounts to cameo appearance also why did stoltz who generally selects his roles with great care agree to appear in this crap ah the mysteries of hollywood the remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary but lopez and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters lopez who starred in selena is an enormously appealing performer possessing vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible ice cube has special charisma an ability to look like macho adult and frightened boy simultaneously there also special twinkle in his eyes as if he gently mocking his own tough guy posturing but the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight obsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas voight plays the villain in thick accent with series of leers and hisses spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of jonny quest at one point he looms over the crew and says the anaconda is the perfect killing machine it strikes wraps around you holds you tighter than your true love and you get the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode that moment is so high camp that it almost made the film tolerable almost fans of the horror genre may be tempted to check out anaconda don there are lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer including another alien sequel wait for them rent jaws in the meantime and don throw away your money and time on drivel like this
well as check my score card for what ve done this holiday weekend it reads good ideas and dumb ideas don know what was thinking when decided to watch this movie but in my defense can only say that it was someone else who urged me to see this with him the film that talking about is `a night at the roxbury one of those offerings based on saturday night live skit wayne and garth these two are not rather we meet doug and steve butabi the actors names are not worth mentioning two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding way to get into the hottest night club in the city the roxbury driving in their dad bmw and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club `have you met my friend washington and his friend roosevelt they confidently say as they pull out spare pocket change their second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pick up lines as is humanly possible in order to start conversation with girl `let me see that label just as thought made in heaven says one of the brothers and like the losers that they are they fail to do either for much of the film however as fate would have it an accidental meeting with `what ever happened to richard grieco gives them the all important ticket to get in their sad lives take on whole new direction they make an important contact with the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene and they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women but their newfound popularity does not impress their father who has other plans for them the unfortunate thing about this film is that this is one joke movie and the brothers are the joke actually there about 10 mintues worth of tolerable stuff alas too long for tv and way too short for feature length film thus there just isn enough material to sustain the 83 minute movie there no plot to be found and everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to the funky beat of haddaway europop song what is love was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash to take up more film time there is subplot involving the daughter of the businessman next door who wants to marry doug this creates not only friction between the brothers but their unlikely pairing will also agitate audience members as well she educated and forebearing witch meanwhile doug is complete loser how did these two ever get together suppose that if can ever figure out the answer to that question ll have figured out why decided to go and see this movie if you re looking for entertainment you won find it at the roxbury
have never been so confused after watching movie meet joe siyah is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year with cinematography music and cast that will dazzle most of us at the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season at first you marvel at the elegant direction graceful cinematography and sensual musical score then you ll wait for something to happen for half an hour but when you finally understand what going on you ll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in film like this the script is simply silly and unresolved story which is artificially stretched into three hour long motion picture it feels like an eternity most of the time it is pompous soap opera filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in high pitched voice and meaningful winks the film is based on alberto caesella play death takes holiday the story concentrates around bill anthony hopkins who lives fulfilled life as successful business man but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears voice that is saying yes soon he meets young elegant gentlemen brad pitt who introduces himself as death it is bill time but death has other plans it has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive our bill is chosen to be death guide and in exchange he gets time bill introduces death as joe siyah who immediately becomes the center of everyone attention bill business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill side lives in his house and resides at his office that is not all however bill youngest daughter susan claire forlani falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her this relationship is bound to have some serious consequences it wouldn be fair to say that this film didn have some interesting moments such as the scene where joe is invited to join bill family for dinner when joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love the experience is somewhat different it is obvious that story like this story is very difficult to structure it one thing to say wouldn it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth to create motion picture out of this is another four screenwriters have worked on script that lacks drive and logic it is overlong and too primitive to pass as serious film on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and very decent direction by martin brest scent of woman hopkins looks great in any role and no matter how shallow or hollow it is he will complete it his talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else since it actually saves the film from complete embarrassment but pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time how can you play death in human form to me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters they are not creatures but phenomenas saying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form handling such ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work speaking in calm soft voice portraying death as lonely distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters he looks and acts more like an angel of death rather than demon or red eyed executioner claire forlani and others are also fine stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits unfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery in other words this is not what expected from the director of scent of woman it could and should be better with such cast and crew in the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on ravishingly looking soap opera

reading the cast and director for the new mobster comedy analyze this asked myself how could this miss robert de niro taxi driver raging bull billy crystal city slickers lisa kudrow the opposite of sex and director harold ramis national lampoon vacation these are usually reliable filmmakers well okay crystal has been in sizable slump lately and tellingly the first half hour of analyze this was very funny unfortunately as the running time ticked away began to think that the first thirty minutes had unbeknownst to me been rewound and were being replayed another two and half times the film has obtained clever premise but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more and more repetitive until finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen middle aged psychoanalyst ben sobel billy crystal life is finally going very well although he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents especially his father who is also psychiatrist ben has an easy going teenage son kyle sabihy and is about to travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend laura lisa kudrow in little but flash however ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently gets paid visit from famed mafia guy paul vitti robert de niro who desperately wants counseling even though he himself won even admit to having anxiety attacks ben tries to help paul mostly so he will get him off his back but the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding which ends with man dropping eight stories to his death it seems to ben that no matter what he does paul vitti will not go away and the more they become involved the more ben potentially happy life gets into danger analyze this has few laughs sprinkled throughout mostly in the first half but always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan ramis and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106 minute running time admittedly de niro is very funny here and can remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe him and crystal is in top form but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them including substantial plotline since analyze this bills not one not two but three writers you think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws but they must have all been on auto pilot one of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters all of which have next to nothing to do and aren even given multi dimensional characters to attempt to develop coming off of her oscar caliber work in two of last year best films clockwatchers and the opposite of sex lisa kudrow throwaway girlfriend role is an incredible step down sure kudrow fellow friend jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in office space but at least we got to spend little time with aniston kudrow meanwhile mostly just stands around no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place chazz palminteri as rival gangster primo fares even worse in role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character finally molly shannon rising film star and cast member on saturday night live has rousingly hilarious one scene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystal patients and then completely disappears too bad considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro and crystal once analyze this approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow laura standing alone at the altar once again had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most ben afterwards the climactic scene with ben posing as fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul became real laugh free dead zone losing its last remaining comic punches analyze this proves that talent can certainly help any film out but when the written material isn up to their level what we are virtually left with is vacuum of thin air
plot little boy born in east germany named hansel loves the american music one day he gets the opportunity to meet and marry an american but first he must get sex change enter hedwig once married the two move to the states but quickly thereafter get divorce at that point hedwig starts writing music and meets another confused boy who soon turns into star that boy also turns his back on hedwig and it isn long before hedwig puts together his her own band and tours the states via seafood restaurants this is the story of his her life told via flashbacks and musical numbers critique an artsy fartsy musical with great songs and superb performance by john cameron mitchell doesn really come together as whole with over the top symbolism incoherence and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through in fact this isn so much of realistic articulate behind the scenes look at the rise of rock roll star as it is an ambiguous overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of man his sexuality and his identity as whole person on this planet guess that was expecting the former going in the film is somewhat interesting to point but was personally never able to involve myself too much as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant but it is definitely tuned to certain type of audience chances are that if you are fan of the wall the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla queen of the desert the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy some of the characters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point and provide the lyrics of their song on screen well personally don care for those films and didn really get into the whole show atmosphere of this movie either guess might ve looked at it all too literally but like said earlier just didn care enough about the characters to delve into the so the butterfly represents his freedom side of things all know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and didn make me feel any more fulfilled what was hedwig relationship with that other member of his band with the beard what happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie was that an actual sequence or fantasy what ever happened to the lawsuit and more all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his her sexuality then that one thing but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie wanted some resolution to those pieces as well didn get it the film humor also didn tickle my funny bone either then again ve seen many film in these art house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter while all see is tiny bit of whimsy on the screen some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added atmosphere of plant called marijuana and can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements in order to jazz up that experience but being sober as was and expecting coherent funny musical with transsexual twist didn leave the theater very satisfied came out having watched an existential story of confused man caught up in musical lifestyle wrapped in metaphors dramatics and more questions than answers will on the other hand definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film john cameron mitchell who is also the man who wrote directed and created the play on which this movie is based and the tunes which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols david bowie and the whole 70s glam rock scene note btw it seems as though pretty much every single mainstream critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom and thought that it was really funny to boot so you might want to take that into consideration yourself but having said that the main reason that started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the official critics while regular joblo in the audience just wouldn get what all the fuss was about this movie is perfect example of why continue to write movie reviews where joblo coming from moulin rouge 10 grease 10 everyone says love you 10 the opposite of sex 10 dancer in the dark 10 brother where art thou 10 love labour lost 10
synopsis original jurassic park survivor alan grant neill is tricked by paul and amanda kirby macy and leoni into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur to rescue their stranded son grant team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought review there is one reason why jurassic park iii is better than its immediate predecessor the lost world jurassic park the latter wasted 129 minutes of my life the former only 94 the first park was marvellous film full of awe inspiring sights interesting characters and genuine thrills its two successors have been pale imitations amounting to hundred million dollar grade horror movies at least this third entry realises it whereas the lost world tried to justify its existence with ludicrous and overextended plot jurassic park iii simply sticks its characters on an island with bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin there is desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie the computer animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting and even the first time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation remember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie nothing in this rehash even comes close add in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman payne and taylor and phoned in performances by the normally capable macy and leoni and it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts at least neill makes some effort to retain the dignity of his character and there is much less gore than in the lost world making this installment more suitable for children
after the recent animated debacles of rugrats movie and bug life am seriously considering raising my highly negative rating on dreamworks other insect film from october antz hated that movie and yet it is so much better than these latest two excursions bug life is the second animated insect film in the last two months and hoped for the best considering it was done in the wonderful style of pixar last film 1995 toy story but in no way does bug life even remotely match up to that flik david foley an ant who along with his many comrades has the job every year of gathering up the seasonal harvest only to have to give half of it away to the dominating grasshoppers led by hopper kevin spacey flik however feels all alone and unwanted in the world especially after he accidentally loses all of their food and the ants are threated by hopper to gather up whole other season load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees banished from ant island flik leaves the colony in search of some strong reinforcement to help out but through misunderstanding returns with handful of helpless circus bugs including walking stick david hyde pierce dung beetle brad garrett gypsy moth madeline kahn male ladybug denis leary and caterpillar joe ranft bug life has one thing going for it only one thing with its glorious bright colors the computer generated animation is spectacle to look at the film itself unfortunately is lifeless unamusing contraption without any of the flair or excitement of toy story the characters in bug life are an assortment of either unlikable or dull insects without any charm or personality other than to stand around and recite arbitrary and thoroughly unfunny one liners the thin story was also stretched out to nearly unbearable 94 minutes and it often felt as if they ran out of ideas throughout and so they made up pointless scenes to pass as time filler after giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from this year was beginning to think that had simply outgrown them but then realized this is just not so still adore almost all of the older disney films and many of the newer ones such as 1989 the little mermaid 1991 beauty and the beast 1993 the nightmare before christmas and yes 1995 toy story maybe this has just been bad year for children films and hopefully the upcoming the prince of egypt will not be disappointment as for bug life did not enjoy anything about it not the story not the characters and not even the voiceover work which was far more lively in antz bug life goes down as yet another failure for disney and it is sad state of affairs when their best film in the last two years has been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture ll be home for christmas

if you re debating whether or not to see _breakfast_of_champions_ ask yourself one simple question do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie the only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross section of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight everyone else and hoping that most people would be wise to steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess actually though the sight of nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle which focuses dwayne hoover bruce willis the owner of dwayne hoover exit 11 motor village in midland city not only is he huge success as businessman he also something of celebrity his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials with nice home and family to boot dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy yet he not his wife celia barbara hershey is perpetually in pill induced haze his son george lukas haas is flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name bunny not only that the environmental protection agency is on dwayne ass over building development project it enough to send dwayne on nervous breakdown that is if he doesn succeed in blowing his brains out first meanwhile midland city is about to host fine arts festival and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout albert finney writer who is far from the renowned author the festival organizer buck henry was led to believe in fact he penniless hack who writes second rate sci fi that appears in porn magazines his trek to midland city is also spiritual journey one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne who for some reason thinks that trout will hold for him all of life answers the above is already longer plot synopsis than usually give in my reviews but ironically have barely scratched the surface haven yet mentioned wayne hoobler omar epps an ex con with an obsessive admiration for the similarly named dwayne then there the matter of francine glenne headly dwayne devoted secretary not to mention dwayne employee and old friend harry lesabre nolte the one with the secret penchant for cross dressing and so on the film is essentially dwayne story but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point is rudolph does arrive at point more on that later but it blunted and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material the surreal visual style complete with printed words flying through the air and into dwayne ears is obviously meant to convey sense of madness but its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad the actors are called on to act accordingly resulting in some of the worst most overdone work all of them have ever turned in willis fares best of all but that because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience with such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running time it comes as shock when things suddenly turn serious and rudolph tries to make statement unlike _american_beauty_ film that _breakfast_ resembles in more than few ways to its great detriment there isn any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the audience for the big shift as such the cartoony characters fail to win sympathy that needs to be earned and the film attempts to no avail to reach profundity that it doesn deserve vonnegut original novel is considered classic but it had been called unfilmable the same that was said of hunter thompson _fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas_ which was disastrously committed to film last year by terry gilliam with the similar failure of _breakfast_of_champions_ will hollywood ever learn that books labeled unfilmable inevitably results in film that is unwatchable likely not
susan granger review of session usa films sometimes you just get more than your bargained for like when boston based hazmat elimination run by scottish actor peter mullan and his trusty assistant david caruso assures town engineer paul guilifoyle that they can remove insidious asbestos fibers from victorian hospital facility in week erected in 1871 deserted and decomposing since 1985 the danvers mental hospital is one of the most malevolent locations ever chosen for film the structure is so massive with its labyrinth of rubble strewn corridors collapsing floors stagnant pools of water isolation cells and ominous surgical chambers where experimental pre frontal lobotomies were performed that their task seems impossible within that time frame and each member of their inexperienced crew stephan gevedon brandon sexton iii and josh lucas is coping with his own personal demons as one by one their minds seem to be affected by the grim areas in which they re working the film title is derived from salvaged reel to reel audio recorded sessions involving the demonic possession of young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities by the time session occurs so do dreadful disasters filmmaker brad anderson obviously envisioned this as gruesome chainsaw massacre type ghost story but the script lacks structure and isn particularly scary the conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing on the granger movie gauge of to 10 session is dark gloomy silly me at first thought that the original name of the danvers lunatic asylum bore some reference to mrs danvers the creepy housekeeper played by judith anderson in alfred hitchcock truly terrifying rebecca that also involved cavernous mansion called manderley

the swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest very tim burton movie but alas no caped crusader descends to save this film instead it skeletal housemaid julia roberts who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling of dr jekyll and mr hyde for few fleeting maddening moments director stephen frears dangerous liaisons gets everything just right the tone the colors the characters all the ingredients to make most powerful potion out of valerie martin best selling novel yet it fizzles too quickly the volatile mixture losing potency from the very first scene casting is large part of the problem the story all but collap ses around ms roberts she doesn have the range for this kind of drama her accent also comes and goes though it nowhere near as glaring as the total lack of chemistry between her and co star john malkovich he looks the same in both of his roles an incredible fact that missed by everyone in the story the very british supporting cast including michael gambon and george cole gives credibility to the smaller parts glenn close also appears as madam that the good doctor calls upon her performance is as close to intentional camp as the movie ever gets and as bonus offers likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville in the live action 101 dalmantions the biggest botch in mary reilly is suspense there is none no terror no tension nothing without any weight wit or wonder to propel the story the viewer is left with little more to do than pay attention to the period detail few buckets of blood and stuart craig fabulously dreary production design all of which gets old after about an hour at which point recommend leaving the pacing in the second half is especially abominable if you do stick it through your sole reward is half hokey special effect depicting the infamous transformation mr frears reportedly recut his film several times missing several release dates in the process obviously no one advised him to throw up his hands and just turn the whole damned thing over to mel brooks blucher mary reilly is the second robert louis stevenson story of the month after muppet treasure island perhaps mr frears should consult with brian henson on future projects daresay that even ms piggy is better choice for certain roles than julia roberts and she does have great chop
the first in very long list of things wrong with still know what you did last summer is the title think about it for second if the last movie was called know what you did last summer wouldn the next movie have to be still know what you did two summers ago if anyone working on this movie had an greater than five would have thought about it logically and said hey wait minute but alas the people behind this film are obviously idiots so won hold them to that what will hold them to is the fact that they have pretty bad movie on their hands even for teenage slasher flick guess one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film emphasis on the kind of it wasn great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good but at least it didn have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it sequel did there are just so many problems with this movie that it hard trying to figure out where to start first of all guess is the setting the movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas other than the fact that the producers wanted seaside setting exactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking radio contest to get julie james jennifer love hewitt one of the only survivors of the first film and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up the movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through in one scene julie is in tanning booth at deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress can get out no matter how hard she tries when julie discovers she going to slowly fry to death she screams for help and her friends come to her rescue now this is all fine and dandy except for one thing instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth why not just turn the freakin thing off in another scene one of the characters after having their significant other all but decapitated by the man in the slicker says to julie just don tell anybody it rained the whole time oh yeah ve just been terrorized by hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered but hey ll crack jokes anyway after all it is in the script the film only saving graces are few well executed suspense sequences and really cool cameo by the re animator himself jeffrey combs he brings some good comic relief and life to an otherwise limp movie way to go jeffrey have hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept it head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson with scream and even it sequel he displayed real talent as screenwriter his ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on all his films make him standout from all the rest of the horror writers and think still know has really suffered by not having him on board the cool atmosphere is still there this time around but just didn like the characters or the writing as much as did in the first one even though the movie doesn have williamson it still has hacky ending trying to do what kevin did with the first two scream by some may consider this spoiler but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes having two killers and this time having one of them being family member to the other think someone in the audience put it best when after the movie had ended with another the killer is back cliffhanger he said who is this time the grandma all in all still know tries to be as successful as the first the film was but really fails in the attempt mean it okay when slasher movies rip off each other but when they start copying themselves
the scene at the end of 1989 `dead poets society when robin williams english students stand up on their desk and say `captain my captain gets me every time unfortunately the court room scene near the end of robin newest film `patch adams doesn have anywhere near the same impact from the surface `patch adams looks very promising it story about not so young man patch adams robin williams who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people when the film opens we find patch depressed and suicidal checking himself into mental hospital in few scenes strongly reminiscent of `one flew over the cuckoo nest he ends up helping the patients through their problems and it here that he finds how much he loves working with people so he checks himself out of the hospital and heads straight to medical school right from the start patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable he continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry shortly after joining medical school he meets and falls in love with carin monica potter they along with patch dork friend truman daniel london start medical clinic for uninsured people once the dean catches wind of the clinic he tells patch he can graduate and kicks him out of school patch like what any true american would do takes the school to court it here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place over whether or not patch can become real doctor have never seen movie with some potential just completely blow it it seems more like series of short sketches rather than full length movie considering it runs almost two hours much too long for such light film it could have flowed much smoother not to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama robin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels but those moments are rare and in the end `patch adams is barely average
have confession even though am movie junkie saw eye of the beholder and yet still watch movies ve never seen any of the original godzillas note that godzilla 2000 is not sequel to the godzilla released in 1998 it the american release of 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni sen mireniamu so part of me was excited as drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000 the latest entry in an almost 50 year old franchise this was long awaited treat was expecting goofy good time complete with bad dubbing science fair level sets and ludicrous plot line the last thing expected was for the movie to be so boring can only imagine what the theatre full of kids saw this with felt you do get all of the so bad they re good traits so normally associated with the franchise but you have to sit through snoozer plot that has the organization of rorschach blot it deal wasn willing to accept hiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimura script crams in way too many details and in many cases fails to follow up on them the maneuver is not only disconcerting but gives the movie permanent logy weighty feel godzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops was it whim bold political statement don know its foe an ancient meteor that looks like prudential logo doesn just fight the beast from the far east no it got to have life saving powers plot to erase the data from japan desire to clone and the ability to become spaceship and then some kind of tentacled space creature there battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit takehiro murata and slimy government official hiroshi abe over the handling of godzilla and personal issues and then there the plucky news photographer and blah blah blah it like watching magnolia all over again except without the good writing keen sociological insight and aimee mann songs what waste when the talking and the plot points stop hurtling at you godzilla 2000 does the job it entertaining and goes down easy the action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though little sluggish the dubbing is nice and awful with murata sounding like he in constant need of cough drop as for the dialogue one line summarizes the goofiness factor did anyone see that flying rock go by this movie also marked the first time since the three stooges that ve heard the word imbecile used in casual conversation though the summer movie season is drying up and godzilla 2000 has its moments wouldn take kids to see it they ll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose
one of my brother favorite movies is halicki 1974 cult flick gone is sixty seconds one of the best products of the car chase genre that provided drive in fare during the 1970 chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue but they had strong visceral appeal although it boasts bigger budget and familiar stars the remake of gone in sixty seconds is relatively weak and dull randall memphis raines nicolas cage is retired car thief who runs go cart track he got out of crime so that his younger brother kip giovanni ribisi would not take up boosting cars however kip became thief anyway and now he in big trouble kip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri christopher eccleston by the end of the week calitri expects memphis to fulfill kip bargain if he doesn come through kip dies memphis gathers his old crew angelina jolie robert duvall will patton chi mcbride and vinnie jones and kip brings his boys cross william lee scott scott caan and james duval as if calitri breathing down their necks wasn bad enough the team is pursued by cop delroy lindo who still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by rival gangster rap star master who wants to take over calitri clients watching gone discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one maybe that why the first forty nine are fairly easy and the thrills are saved for eleanor 1967 shelby gto model that has always eluded memphis but the big chase doesn live up to the long wait had high hopes for gone because it is director dominic sena second film kalifornia his 1993 debut was brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience in that movie sena took simple thriller plot couple gives serial killer ride and successfully endowed it with deeper significance in gone he seems to be aiming for drama about two brothers who can communicate with each other but that goal just doesn mesh with this plot gone either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough it not light enough to be fun or mean enough to be intense this chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it the lack of action is waste of the premise which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever the weak script is waste of talented cast in newsweek interview last year sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies much as like cage for every good picture he does leaving las vegas bringing out the dead there are two major stinkers snake eyes con air 8mm city of angels that ratio is probably better than what lot of his peers can boast but cage has real talent it shame to waste it in glitzy superficial tripe like gone in 60 seconds
have you ever been in an automobile accident where you ve miraculously walked away with only few scratches yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable mangled wreck well that has never actually happened to me and hope that none of us will ever experience this situation but after watching this inane exercise of movie certainly feel that ve miraculously walked away unscathed after two hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond oddly `eye of the beholder which is psychological romance thriller starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to british intelligence agent called the eye ewan mcgregor working in washington dc in the humorous opening scene he eyes top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down using an array of high tech surveillance and communications equipment he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office the law firm employees get good chuckle the audience gets good chuckle the eye is later given an assignment where he encounters beautiful woman ashley judd there is something compelling about this mysterious woman despite her glamorous looks however we learn that she is psychopath with propensity to kill men that get too close to her after the murders she sobs while singing the christmas tune `little bluebirds and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago after each killing she puts on different wig assumes new name and then makes her way to another state the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions but he does not alert the authorities he somehow empathizes with her sense of loss the eye it turns out also is haunted by his past his daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life his tormented psyche creates ghost like image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation she becomes sort of spectral adviser and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman he now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation it doesn matter that he has witnessed all of her murders and it doesn matter that the eye is abnormally reticent hiding his entire life behind computer screens he follows her to dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble when crazed druggie jason priestley attacks her he shows up for some quick butt kicking when the police are closing in to arrest her he provides distraction so that she can escape all the while the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight peculiar how bad is this movie refer you to my `review quote source litmus test just take look at the full page ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes for this movie they are from magazines called `flaunt and `mirabella no doubt they were impressed with judd series of catwalks and disguise changes the major problem with `eye of the beholder is that the film jerks forward always unsure of its ultimate destination if it was thriller there was little to keep us entranced if it was love story there was absolutely no emotional pull completely disjointed in structure it only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial the one where the `6 on the tachometer dissolves into winding road and passenger rail car dissolves into small miniature on child train set am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find serious role to showcase her potential talents beyond that the film is hopelessly out of control and is in need of seriously better traction and handling
bad bad bad that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls if that summary isn enough for you how about t&a t&a t&a still haven got the point other than director russ meyer predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore mentioned anatomical areas there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking look at this movie that is the fact that it was co written by famed film critic roger ebert who also was responsible for the screenplay after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives movie thumbs down for bad writing with straight face this movie stinks out loud quite frankly this movie deserves but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny so giving it and maybe that is too generous right from the opening credits knew that had class bomb on my hands not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting but the first scene you see includes big breasted young woman being chased by guy in nazi uniform had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening it does get explained later and as soon as the first scene is over we cut to completely unrelated scene to be honest as sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film it wouldn have surprised me if the opening had never been explained so what is this movie about you ask like it really matters ok here goes this all girl band headed by kelly macnamara dolly reed and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain foothold in the music industry once there they do manage to find success due as much to their hooters as anything else it sure wasn for their brutally bad singing voices and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them everything from big egos to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on downward spiral there are couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing >from creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here other than the above mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts mr ebert has generously thrown in helpings of hey man dig and my all time favorite this is my happening and it freaks me out now ask you with lines like that how can you go wrong ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter don know but all the big words in the world wouldn be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie ve seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey in fact there is one scene the one in which they are in van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes during which really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries add to the directing and writing the music in this movie almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken there was such pile of crap emanating from the speakers then we have the cast first lets start david gurian who played harris the manager of the band this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of motion picture camera sadly his acting doesn come close to making up for his looks if you have been following along up to this point this shouldn surprise you meyer stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets dolly reed plays kelly the leader of the band and no surprise here she was cast for her cup size not her talents and yes she does loose the shirt few times and display her impressive talents sadly her ass is almost as large as her chest hey it sexist movie so writing sexist review then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in fairly small role as casey one of the other band members this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie meyer casts gorgeous playmate with rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all sure russ now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows on the up side she does have fun lesbo scene sound like writing review in porn magazine but hey ll admit it the only reason that actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch look at cynthia myers naked and since that was huge disappointment pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey the only thing that can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet this is movie that should be avoided at all costs an even better idea might be to require video stores to place warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls beware this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense proceed with extreme caution
look the new version of psycho came out and the world didn end guess gus van sant really isn the bringer of the apocalypse unfortunately though that psycho didn end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it van sant controversial re telling of alfred hitchcock classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere even before it premiered without benefit of an actual viewing many have said that the film will at best suck being an almost good critic waited until actually saw it to decide that the film at best sucked and that concludes the use of the word suck and hopefully the thoughts that am brain dead orangutan director gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it shot for shot using the same exact script with few minor alterations the inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary even though large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original sadly that did not occur it is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin from the original psycho but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen in moore case the film would have been helped if the files gillian anderson had been cast instead especially since moore goes through the entire film doing scully impression from the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming sentence moore is scully mortensen who liked in jane opts to play sam loomis as cowboy hick which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point sam has twang and cowboy hat but that about it mortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory anne heche in the janet leigh role does few good things in her brief time on screen at least her marion crane has little life in her which can be said for most of the rest of the cast the best work though comes from vince vaughn as the demented mama boy norman bates he not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins but he is effective both in being naughty and nice the best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn where they simply talk there is some solid acting there something that is not carried through the rest of the film van sant has made boring film all the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 aren as eye catching now what passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they don impress or excite van sant in what assume is grasp at originality decided to put some stream of consciousness images into few famous scenes was that lamb in the middle of the road these images included with some questionable editing choices took away from the scenes themselves and caused at first bewilderment and later laughter definitely not hitchcock intention at least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmann original famous and terrific score if film like psycho does not frighten then what the point aside from norman the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience there are things van sant and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting in the end however the new psycho is noble attempt but alas dismal failure
attention moviegoers you are about to enter meaning free zone should the sound system malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes do not panic the film will work just as well as silent movie chronicling the meaningless lives of vain yuppie types the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films last days of disco barcelona and metropolitan but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing first time writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth there isn one of these characters worth caring about the movie features such cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks like celluloid version of people magazine among others the movie features ben affleck casey affleck david chappelle janeane garofalo gaby hoffmann catherine kellner courtney love jay mohr martha plimpton christina ricci and paul rudd and unlike people magazine the people speak not that they have anything interesting to say it new year eve in 1981 and monica martha plimpton is preparing her big party structured as series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way to the party director risa bramon garcia flits back and forth among her stars monica apartment is in noho an area that one of the guests describes as so cool all of the poor people live there typical of the shallow couples in the movie are kevin paul rudd and his friend and would be sexual partner lucy courtney love they argue about whether lucy is slut or not since she sleeps with everyone except him of course she dares him to go immediately to bathroom stall and have sex with her which turns out to be neither erotic funny or successful rather like the rest of the story the movie gets its title from the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his new year eve birthday cigarettes are shield against emotional interaction with other people kevin later tells lucy in snippet of dialog that sounds profound only outside the context of the movie another character played by jay mohr has problem with his sexual triumphs every woman he beds falls deeply in love with him by the next morning when his latest conquest tells him of her affection for him his response is like lot of people as the movie finally draws to close the characters awaken from their post party game of musical beds some have passed out early from alcohol abuse and remember little while others actually have some clue as to what happened the movie itself is so forgettable that by the time you reach your car in the parking lot all trace of the film will have vanished from your mind which is probably the best thing that can be said about the movie 200 cigarettes runs 40 it is rated for profanity sex and one dope smoking scene and would be acceptable for older teenagers
some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have good time playing god asks just one simple eensy teensy thing so it can fully entertain you it accomplished in just four easy to follow steps crack open your skull scoop out your brain squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one congratulations you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy whole lot of nothing some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been good movie others are simply good ideas that are badly executed then there playing god which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of drunk director actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and bunch of rip offs or homages as they like to call it from other better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet harsh maybe justified hell yes this is movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes for example gunman bursts into garden with the two guns in his hands firing away this does look moderately kool but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling oooh look look john woo two guns blazing slooooow motion and if that wasn enough you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in tarantino movie poor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines you have to admire the effort he puts into it this guy deserves better unlike most movies this one does not suffer from stupid bad guy syndrome just to make things little different this time we get stupid heroes example duchovny manages to distract bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages now the bad guy is like stoned man so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero term used as loosely as possible survival instincts and good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun which our hero does but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it going so far as to actually wonder if he should place finger near the trigger mind you ve never fired shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs be he stoned or not some will argue that our hero does not have killer instinct the hell with that two fbi guys have just been shot in front me along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second solution boom ll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of building and that he might be running into room full of people with itchy trigger fingers he still has his shotgun bring it along you say no thanks ll just ditch it in the back of my car and the real kicker is this when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised while we are on the subject of getting shot why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door ve got no formal training but even know you never sit with your back to the door ask mr wild bill the first and only time he did not sit with his back to wall cost him his life this is the major problem with this movie any mook could have thought of hundred ways to make it better is it so much to ask that hollywood actually put little common sense into their characters for instance our heroes hide at duchovny summer home now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment ok this time our hero does get himself gun and has it at his side most of the time but see our hero is drug addict and guess what he chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt oh sure he ll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling going clean is really honorable of him but would have waited until did not need to be conscious or being able to fire gun for an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton plot holes the size of godzilla getting our intelligence insulted and several oh come on moments
if you haven plunked down your hard earned money yet for wild wild west the latest summer holiday offering from will smith let me say right now that your money will be better spent on starbuck frappacino or on ben jerry sundae these treats are great relief from the summer heat in contrast this film made me simmer in disappointment can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take back seat this was true of star wars episode but at least in that film the story and the characters were still in the back seat in this film they are no where to be found what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats lots of female extras who look like can can dancers and clunky 80 foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles mechanical tarantula two men are asked to stop this threat one is artemus gordon kevin kline an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest the other man is jim west will smith who prefers the shoot first then shoot some more method of investigating although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success their interaction with one another merely seemed like second rate two man vaudevillian act for example there is scene where west being more debonair than the reserved gordon notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat which is what it is currently filled with now touch my breast west says gordon does so and then softly coos his approval found myself groaning at this kind of silliness the script fails to generate any sense of drama humor or fun for that matter did enjoy kline reserved performance but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith could it be that will smith is just so bankable that he not even required to act it was as if the director was yelling will smith do your own thing and action here an example in this scene will smith is about to be hanged by group of angry beyaz people he must endear himself to the crowd to escape the director yells will smith do your own thing and action in another scene he has to masquerade as belly dancer in order to save his comrades will smith do your own thing and action worse still the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is horrid mess there are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers going up and down everywhere you look there actually lot of imagination at work in this film there are some genuinely clever inventions and gizmos introduced but all of this imagination is wasted in film that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat and that too bad because if there was more focus on the story rather than will smith just doing his thing this film might have been palatable as it turns out wild wild west is the wild wild worst and receives my vote for biggest disappointment of the year
contrary to popular belief not every single foregin film released to an american market is masterpiece some of them aren even good some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful un indien dans la ville presented as little indian big city and remade into that crap tim allen flick jungle2jungle and this what could have been clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of french flick french twist the cool american title not the real one which was gazon maudit literally meaning twisted ground or something like that deals with married couple with kids and the intrusion of stranger who kinda screws things up for them loli and alain chabat victoria abril and alain chabat are not exactly happily married always on business trips alain chabat more than once cheats on her and she eventually finds out and one day she meets butch mechanic marijo the co writer director josiane balasko and they two kinda hit it off so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious sleeping with marijo but she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo but she also realizes she still in love with alain chabat so of course she does the obvious from that she decides to keep them both she ll be and sleep with each of them for days each then on sunday she ll rest by herself after all she needs it if she gonna have more sex than sylvia kristel the film goes on for over an hour and half through stupidity after stupidity moronic twist after moronic twist and soon there the little ironic ending know it completely different culture and quite familiar with the french and their cinema but this is just bad none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in fargo movie where stupid characters were backed up to make point and any action they do is pretty much just to get hopeful chuckle from the audience what shocking is this was not only one of france biggest hits but it was nominated for lot of cesars french equivalent of oscars the writing and directing is really the big problem with it josiane balasko does good acting job with her role but her little sex comedy isn very humerous entertaining or even deep at all even woody allen not very good midsummer night sex comedy is intelligent well written and possesses some depth this is shallow unfunny and pretty annoying to watch the film moves at the pace of snail and is damn near painful to watch thank god for the fast forward button the acting however isn bad at all the actors do the best they can with the bad material and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script and the fact that she stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people when she has kids and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband but french twist is just pretty lame it not overly horrible and has couple very very very brief moments but it just really crap film and an example of an ill advised distribution of foreign film
conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty five or thirty years after the item was made that when the kids of that time have jobs disposable income and desire to re visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you ll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks there heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work day world for long time they like to re capture some of that fun they remember from days of yore hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time and for the most part they re messing it up mission impossible lost in space godzilla zorro none of these successfully capture the originals none of these are even good films you can now add the avengers to the list the british television series began in 1961 super secret agent john steed then patrick macnee and his third partner emma peel then diana rigg are the pair that the american audience fell for surrealistic and witty the series fit the mood of the times the leather clad rigg probably didn hurt the ratings either after all it not coincidence that you can pronounce her character name without appeal now we re in the nineties steed now ralph fiennes and peel now uma thurman are battling evil genius sir august de wynter sean connery who is screwing with england weather that about as much of plot as we have there some footage about lot of other things that either don make sense or make even less sense we get betrayal for some unknown reason evil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason there high tech hot air balloon but have no idea why anyone in it the spy agency is run by man called mother who is in wheelchair and woman named father who is blind at least in some scenes there probably reason for all of this but we ll never know it macnee makes an appearance of sorts he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in scene that does nothing group of villains sits around table all clad in huge pastel colored teddy bear outfits at first it humorous to watch the teddies waddle around but then it becomes goofy the movie is medley of clutter confusion and wrong decisions around every corner it feels like major portions of the film are missing the storyline jumps rather than flows reportedly the film was re cut several times this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing there one good point where peel is running from one room to another in house designed by escher other than that the effects are second rate the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it doesn work she looks good dresses in all the right fetish outfits but there no spark fiennes fares even less well macnee steed was witty man of the world with sense of humor fiennes agent comes across as dour kid in grown up clothes who has never been out of his home town even connery one of the greatest living actors doesn have much of presence outside of few fiery scenes the action scenes are difficult to follow director jeremiah chechik responsible for the atrocious remake of diabolique somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldn be things happen people move around but even if with the utmost effort you were able to care about any of it the scenes are bewildering the primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were winning combination admittedly there are few humorous sexual puns in the film but there no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever one of emma peel first lines of dialog is rules are made to be broken it doesn get any better advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone the release date was changed several times connery refuses to promote the film there was no screening for critics which may have been good choice for warner brothers at least this way they get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out admittedly haven seen an episode of the television series for couple of decades my guess is that it would be severely dated now no matter how antiquated it might be there no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing there no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside watching this movie no reason at all
few months before the release of star wars episode the phantom menace 20th century fox decides to release another space film that is complete rip off of star wars what is the point of this do not know but wish it hadn been done considering wing commander is definitely the year worst film so far to attract people to this horrible movie they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace wing commander will draw large crowds because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience had tonight many people do not know that wing commander is based on star wars computer game found this very interesting considering this fact almost says that wing commander is star wars movie it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though freddie prinze jr stars in the film as christopher blair wing commander was huge mistake for freddie this was definitely his worst performance to date after january she all that actually saw good actor in freddie but now all those visions have been crushed for now anyway christopher blair is pilot who is part of the battle to stop the kilrathi group that is trying to destroy the earth blair parents also fought in the space battles and also died there his parents were pilgrims so many people disrespect him because of this blair is under the command of angel played by saffron burrows and he is friends with another pilot todd maniac marshall played by matthew lillard matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie and he does in this one too his character as stu in 1996 scream a+ was great one but now it seems like that same role is being played again only in space movie the three are just small part of large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth this plot is very flimsy and doesn give whole lot to work with at all this explains why wing commander drags on seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on the acting is horrible in wing commander many lines seem out of place and are completely meaningless the acting and dialogue was so terrible even found myself laughing at it the other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music the special effects are very unrealistic when looking at two ships flying side by side it is simple to tell they are hanging and mavi screen is behind them the explosions look very unrealistic as well ship will be blown up but there will only be fire present four about one half of second this is very unrealistic music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time the music also felt like video game music and it was very corny and annoying sounding after we are given the plot the film repeats itself for another hour without any plot twists interesting scenes or anything important to the film blair is forced to make jumps over other planets and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft for the entire length of the movie it takes place in space it is truly like you are in video game because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for long extended period of time it not much fun to watch at all if wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships would go watch star wars at home at least star wars pays attention to people myth feelings and has some real plot to it the bottom line bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox
when walt disney pictures announced live action feature based on the 60s cartoon series of mr magoo special interests groups representing the vision impaired let out cry of dismay mr magoo they claimed would be an insult to the men and women they represented in fact they were wrong mr magoo is not just an insult to the blind and near blind it an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny 90 minute atrocity it stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases and you ll see shocking list of retreads including 101 dalmatians george of the jungle jungle2jungle that darn cat flubber and now mr magoo the best of these george of the jungle was mildly entertaining the worst mr magoo exposes just how painful bad movie experience can be the first problem with mr magoo is the script despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft mr magoo is comically barren from beginning to end there not laugh to be found every attempt at humor and there are lots of them falls flat with an audible thud you think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film at least few would work but that not the case ve had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures then there leslie nielsen who looks sounds and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character memorably voiced by jim backus in the past nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun lately however he has been getting lazy taking parts in the likes of dracula dead and loving it spy hard and mr magoo even if nielsen was in top form it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo especially since we re reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film but top form is not phrase would use to describe his performance here this is strictly take the money and run operation the story which like many disney stories can be described in one long sentence magoo is the only witness to the theft of rare jewel from museum and as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own the police mistake him for the robber the cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky who take their lumps early and often the bad guys are kelly lynch who does lot of martial arts type kicking nick chinlund and malcolm mcdowell who has the good sense to look embarrassed matt keeslar portrays one of magoo sidekicks his nephew waldo the bumbling man other more interesting companion is dog named angus most of mr magoo humor comes in the form of failed slapstick the cartoon violence level in this film doesn approach that of home alone or flubber but it still pretty acute with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices there non violent bit with magoo preparing chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better but compared to mr bean recent similar misadventure it doesn hold up well then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo near blindness such as the occasion when he mistakes wild animal for baby willing to cut director stanley tong little slack tong hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market has helmed several jackie chan movies including first strike rumble in the bronx and supercop his chief talent that of choreographing martial arts fights is wasted here despite some high kicking by kelly lynch like john woo hard target and ringo lam maximum risk before him it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream it is worth noting that unlike many disney films which hold perverse appeal for the under 10 crowd while driving parents to distraction mr magoo appears to bore viewers of all ages the screening attended was wall to wall kids and for the most part they didn seem to be enjoying themselves when the film was over asked one little girl what she thought of it her pained expression confirmed the adage that picture can indeed be worth thousand words mr magoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer sight unseen
mr bean bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of masterpiece american painting the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean trip to la but if they didn look out because you are in for rather interesting if not odd ride heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick either way look out america bean is coming well what can really be said about this movie there is very little discernible plot that much is not hard to grapple with for it is slapstick comedy it achieves that goal rather admirably but because it is that the plot is just screaming for help the whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on whim and carried through and in many causes ad libbed as you went don go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie even if you don like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something are just so stupid the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims or so it seems now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner well there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn the easiest am sure have to concede that mr atkinson acting in this movie is well done although the role isn too demanding the slapstick is think that the character could have had bit more dialogue it would have added quite bit to the overall effect of the movie now the rest of the actors in the movie bad acting and poor casting think that the role opposite bean could have been better just seemed wrong for the movie different actor might have done better job of it but wont presume that wasn what was trying to be achieved one thing that must say simply to get if off my chest is that think transferring sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results tv shows should do just that stay on tv it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers can only think of couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively the best known of those would have to be star trek bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved now another thing that have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people these people will think like did that this movie is stupid and pointless but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie but to be on the safe side am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one

the best thing about lake placid is that it only 80 minutes long and when it over you re glad that you didn waste more than an hour and half of your time it nothing more than bad rip off of jaws and think that being kind it was written by david kelly ally mcbeal as horror comedy but fails at both miserably was never scared and think that only laughed once the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in anaconda the plot begins when man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in siyah lake in maine that brings the local sheriff brendan gleeson and fish and game warden bill pulman to investigate also paleontologist bridget fonda from new york is sent to look at tooth and an eccentric millionaire crocodile lover oliver platt flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it there also an eccentric old lady betty beyaz who lives by the lake and has few secrets as mentioned before kelley and director steve minor h20 don go for serious approach towards the material but they also don have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either the betty beyaz character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting they re all basically idiots if they had any brains the croc wouldn have been that much of challenge to catch and they wouldn have put themselves in half of the situations that they did but then again if they were smart there wouldn be movie basically lake placid is best undiscovered
the previews for the movie are pretty good they show little plot all the characters and the emotional highlights all spliced together to give general impression of the script unfortunately the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes the residents of mystery love hockey mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit player who guilty of shooting another man yes that one of the movie jokes every saturday the best players pair off for game and the whole town comes to watch the town prodigal son charlie hank azaria wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated mystery national fame has the town abuzz week later charlie actually shows up in person and he brings with him an offer from the nhl the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals the mysterians see this as both good and bad on the one hand they love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition on the other hand they don want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes the movie follows handful of lives that are affected by the proposition biebe russell crowe has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys including his new replacement he already resentful and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife crowe is not given lot of room to act in this film so he just kind of stuck with constantly brooding charlie meanwhile is resentful of having born in town where hockey is the only measure of man worth his gift of the feature story and of the new york rangers was his way of compensating for not being better skater he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter the judge whose courtroom was befouled by moronic jury of hockey fans walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey but he actively tries to put it behind him he wants his son to take the game more seriously but he wants his community to just get over it reynolds could have been good but sloppy writing and or editing keep walter in the corner and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together one character actually was interesting biebe wife mary mccormack like the judge understood that there was more to life than hockey but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open her unique insight is verbalized once and it lasts only scene before it is gone but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom mysterty alaska follows handful of other characters but none are well developed or worth mentioning the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story no underlying thing that the movie is really about instead roach and screenwriters david kelley and sean byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy they try to make you laugh and cry to feel outrage and pride they present the framing and cadence for jokes but there nothing truly funny they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness but they give you nothing to be really sad about as columnist molly ivins would say it all hat no cattle the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about there is funeral scene played with appropriate gravity and somber music it is chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what truly important russell crowe steps forward to speak about to spell out the movie metaphor for us he says that what really matters in life is community then adds and hockey guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear only mildly bad mystery alaska probably deserves stars even laughed out loud genuine laughs in places but docked it an extra half star when mike myers friend of roach turned up in role that didn suit him myers is comic character actor he puts on masks becomes an outrageous caricature and is funny he great as austin powers dr evil or any of his scottish characters nobody else in mysterty alaska is comic caricature all the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi serious roles for roach to bring in myers for few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast toward his audience and indeed toward the film itself it an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously
guess that if very wild bachelor party had gone really bad there would be broken furniture traces of smack and cocaine on the floor and dead prostitute in the bathroom guess that if movie had also gone really bad there might be the same elements present coincidence poor kyle meek looking jon favreau he is about to marry his radiant fiancee laura cameron diaz but before he exchanges his vows he embarks to las vegas with his friends for one last blowout but this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly get the prostitute has met horrible though accidental death and drugs are everywhere the five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them to jail for very long time surprisingly calm robert boyd christian slater who looks like he was groomed to make nefarious decisions ponders their dilemma for few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the body in the desert where she ll never be found although they stomach the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body which also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it into suitcases when they return from their trip guilt and paranoia begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends one is adam daniel stern he grows increasingly agitated whenever people look at his van or whenever cop glances his way his blood pressure increases or that just may be because of his dysfunctional family another is michael who was actually responsible for her death he tries to bury his feelings but the burden of guilt begins to affect his judgment as well boyd is the doer of the group seemingly suffering from long psychosis when he feels as if his secret is about to be exposed he is apt to take extreme measures to cover up his tracks kyle just hopes that his wedding will live up to laura demanding expectations then there moore leland orser who speaks lines and walks around with puzzled look on his face the problem with this reprehensible movie is that it wants to be cruel comedy but it presents things in manner that just aren funny drugs mutilation and killing your own friends isn something to be laughed at as straight psychological drama could see how it might have worked as each one tried to maneuver and overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimes sick ways but this movie insults us by assuming that we could simply discard our values for hours if you do like this movie don think that want to know you did find slater convincing leader who sways his friends to choose not the right thing but the smart play and diaz adds some brightness to this film as wedding needing fiancee but her talents are essentially wasted here it obvious that the film maker is trying to strike certain tone but the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless do not make very bad decision by seeing this film
had been looking forward to this film since heard about it early last year when matthew perry had just signed on big fan of perry subtle sense of humor and in addition think chris farley on edge extreme acting was riot so naturally when the trailer for almost heroes hit theaters almost jumped up and down soda in hand the lights dimming was ready to be blown away by farley final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry big breakthrough was ready to be just amazed for this to be among farley best in spite of david spade absence was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran sadly none of this came to pass the humor is spotty at best with good moments and laughable one liners few and far between perry and farley have no chemistry the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade for it his type of humor and not at all what perry is associated with and the movie tries to be smart subject best left alone when it farley flick the movie is major dissapointment with only few scenes worth first look let alone second perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie and not surprisingly the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley and farley classic humor is widespread too almost heroes almost works but misses the wagon train by quite longshot guys let leave the exploring to lewis and clark huh stick to tommy boy and we ll all be friends

writing screenplay for thriller is hard harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun harder than building bridge over troubled waters and incidentally whole heck of lot harder than writing movie review thrillers are all variations on theme you have smart resourceful and powerful bad guy who has goal he has to meet you have noble and brave good guy who has to protect the innocent kill the bad guy and not get killed himself in the process the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest high noon or silence of the lambs or big summer blockbusters like men in siyah the fugitive or air force one or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds event horizon kull the conqueror is anyone else getting depressed here point is it not enough to follow the formula you ve got to throw in something extra something good and new and better than the last version something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals this is hard thing to do but it is absolutely necessary in every way without that something extra whether it great plot or well written screenplay or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs the movie fails that why the jackal with all its starpower with all its budget with all its hype gets big fat bruce willis is the bad guy the jackal legendary killer for hire richard gere is the good guy former ira assassin with vendetta against the jackal the jackal is trying to kill someone gere is trying to stop him will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal ll give you three guesses and the first two don count there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal no moment when you say to yourself wonder what happens next the script for the jackal isn ripped straight from today headlines it ripped off straight from an episode of millennium throughout the movie we learn what the jackal plans are and how he intends to accomplish them no surprise the fun of movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal plan is and developing clever plan to foil the bad guy instead we get two count em two scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackal plan just as if he frank siyah or more likely just as if he been handed copy of the script and we never get more than superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight it like gere character is psychic but neither he nor the fbi or the screenwriters seem to know it and just like in millennium the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about whether or not they are important to what he trying to do or not what more in the last half of the movie the jackal supposedly super smart professional terrorist who never makes mistake comes down with major case of the stupids as for the performances bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without wisecrack which is major achievement but not enough reason to see the movie his disguises are good but not as good or as interesting as val kilmer in the saint richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in overwhelmingly disappointing movie not that his performance is bad or anything it not but it is sad that hollywood won use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent shoot to kill sneakers writing good plot and good screenplay like said is hard but it can be done it wasn done here it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones do not go see this movie you ll only encourage the producers to make more just like it instead stay home and rent day of the jackal or in the line of fire or fire safety video for crying out loud anything other than the jackal which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other better movies
well there goes another one sadly this like other movies this year wasn good this one being almost as bad as the omega code but not quite from the opening credits had good feeling this would be bad and well guess was right with bad excuses for acting horrible screenplay and straight out bad direction the bachelor is terribly unfunny movie that doesn work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give good performance the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best the movie is troubled from the start because chris donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date here is the stupid plot chris donnell plays jimmie shelton man who has just broken up with his girlfriend he meets anne rene zellwegar they instantly hit it off and are together for three years jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship little bit up he really doesn realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her what he wants never did catch so he proposes in really bad way and she shoots him down and is very mad he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars as long as he marries before the next day at 05 pm now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her or get married to someone else to get the money itself leading to an un funny and predictable ending that leaves bad taste in our mouths ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest cliched silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs even the supporting roles of artie lange hal holbrook and ed anser aren even good the plot was good idea but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by five year old the choppy dialogue and bad directing don help things any even though chris donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies he does not give even remotely good or funny performance here and wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him rene zelweggar is different story and gave charming sweet and likable performance as usual and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being total huge washout her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen brooke shields showed up in funny little performance as big headed mogul who after while became routine and old one really can help but think that we have seen this stuff before it not like this is an original idea and in the end everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness the bachelor works on no good levels and in fact doesn work at all ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career chris donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying great deal he seems held back and really doesn get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un nerving why the filmmakers would want to waste such cast in such bad movie with such bad acting and dialogue is question only they will know maybe they thought it would become hit or critical success and sometimes don agree with other critics on movies even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts its based on the 1925 silent film seven chances which am sure is very better than this mess even though some may think of this as good date movie most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back besides being terrible movie the bachelor is well terrible movie it has nothing worth recommending therefore really can recommend this movie did not have good time and laughed only three times the running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes parts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time being one of the worst movies of the year we can be sure that hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies and if they do they give up on filmmakers
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned at the end of the day those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for gala premiere this highly anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening where it would have gone head to head against the rival studios heavy hitters its eventual demotion to less potent mid august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio lack of confidence with the picture and with good reason this is joyless exercise of film held together by barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement thrills or wit remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving the avengers is catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year case study in style over substance joel schumacher much loathed batman robin indeed both films even feature appalling ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes uma thurman who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit clad karate chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster imbuing her poison ivy with dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage unfortunately the same can be said here where she and cohort ralph fiennes our new john steed taking over for patrick macnee demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they re on board sinking ship at this rate usually splendid actor mr fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days the duo look the part and admittedly the avengers is more than most heavily dependent upon style but they re no fun to watch and found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture caper esque plot when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs peel no not kate beckinsale although the notion now intrigues me but gwyneth paltrow who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle spot on english accent if nothing else it at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt the story such as it is involves the ever bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter sean connery an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate controlling contraption they also sip lot of tea overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists superiors it sounds far better than it plays and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post production tinkering it clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds the avengers was never about gripping drama and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac it all decidedly uncompelling mr connery who onscreen barely long enough to register an impression approaches the role like man fulfilling contractual obligation simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest at least it all looks good this is genuinely handsome production with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt in particular the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain there are handful of striking visual moments in the film including an attack by swarm of giant robotic bees and nice shot of steed and peel finding way to walk on water but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates by the time the film climax had arrived my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain but with the quickest escape route from the theatre not coincidentally the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie remarkable trailer savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year it everything that the avengers is not saucy clever engaging and entertaining crushing disappointment the film is one of the worst outings of the year too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad too polished to overlook its deficiencies there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers but sure hope not
the first species was moderately successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects few well paced action sequences and frequent views of model turned actress natasha henstridge sans clothing however it was definitely not movie that cried out for sequel and considering the quality of species it obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead the only thing that distinguishes species is how awful it is if you throw away the plot which is characterized by blatant disregard for intelligence logic coherence and consistency species actually has few things to recommend it to select audience of course that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys who at least in theory shouldn be able to get into an rated film and connoisseurs of bad movies there enough blood gore simulated sex and bare flesh in species to prevent it from ever becoming boring this is grade exploitation flick that ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment somewhere someplace recall hearing species described as erotic would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie because he or she has peculiar notion of eroticism sure there lot of sex and nudity but it almost always accompanied by the ripping open of woman abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free splattering blood and gore in all directions anyone turned on by that is not someone would care to be sitting next to in theater suppose the main attraction in species is natasha henstridge and to get the obvious question out of the way yes she does remove her top but only once and only briefly although the character she played in the original species is dead government scientists still have the dna and out of what can only be described as suicidal impulse they decide to create another clone this creature dubbed eve by its creator dr laura baker played by marg helgenberger reprising her role is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile meanwhile man has finally set foot on mars team of three led by patrick ross justin lazard has traveled to the kirmizi planet but when they return to earth they bring something with them ross has become half human half alien hybrid and he soon mating like crazy collecting the blood soaked children that are the result of each sex session his intention is obviously world domination standing in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film preston lennox michael madsen and one of patrick fellow astronauts dennis gamble mykelti williamson but when patrick learns about eve female of his kind there no damping his ardor not sure what the budget for species was but significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors as opposed to being diverted into the special effects michael madsen and marg helgenberger both back for second round are clearly on hand to do as little as they can grab the money and run ditto for james cromwell who plays patrick father underused is too kind word to describe his involvement invisible would be more like it george dzundza gets to do little scenery chewing as an angry but inept general meanwhile justin lazard performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge limited abilities look good by comparison the only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson who is cast in the part of the wisecracking siyah sidekick complete with cheesy special effects bare breasts around every narrative corner and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter species has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics director peter medak journeyman film maker with significant list of mediocre movies on his resume has added another forgettable title but at least he appears to have had fun doing it which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even scintilla of seriousness do recommend the movie absolutely not but will admit that species is dopey enough that it didn try my patience to the degree that some pseudo intellectual bad movies do here hoping there no species
the sequel to mission impossible is james bond wannabe film but it fails to even come close to that film in wit humor and entertainment value it tries to be spy romance movie but without any suspense the film just looks like it an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses it is film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human the coolest thing about this movie was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols the film plays as if it was wet fantasy dream about techie violence except for the choreographed action sequences the film was dull for three quarters of its time filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed as for the action scenes they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films but their advertisement for sadistic responses is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen opens and closes with fast paced action scenes but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue the film looks as if it had been invaded by computer virus at that point the only thing that kept me awake was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way it mega buck film adapted from popular high tech gadgetry tv series but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it and it failed to produce story that had any substance john woo broken arrow face off is good at doing car chases choreographed fights with midair flips and kung fu kicks slo mo shots of two guns blazing and of fire explosions but he just can seem to handle dialogue and suspense the star of the film and co producer tom cruise and his romantic interest thandie newton are miscast cruise is no james bond and looks more like yuppie than superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile as he tries to carry off this macho role while thandie is not an action film girl and seems like fish out of water in this one their romance didn work not only was it tepid and not sexy but it wasn convincing the film opens with dizzying speed perhaps with the hope that befuddled audience is its best bet for success we will be in three different locations instantaneously sydney the american southwest and seville first we are in sydney australia where scientist with muffled russian accent dr nekhorvich rade mentions that he created deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it he also mentions that every hero needs worthy villain which explains the film mythic theme as we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil the one who played the villain dougray scott does so in one dimensional gruff tone which did not distinguish him in that role at least if the film got the villain part right it might have had some fun with this nonsense soon the diabolical scientist is on plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains before they crash the plane and parachute out of it the one who was posing as dimitri turns out to be sean ambrose scott rogue member of the imf which is cia like clone he steals the package with the antidote peels off latex mask which is replica of the hero of the story ethan hunt cruise who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face off and in the original mission impossible which as convoluted plot as that film had it was still superior film to this sequel woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground as it is used so often in this film by both sides so much so that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense next we are in mountain range in the american southwest and ethan is on vacation hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool when helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard delivers via rocket launcher pair of talking sunglasses hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help billy baird john polson and luther stickell ving rhames with luther running high gadget computer but he also must get jewel thief named nyah hall thandie to join his team he is told as an incentive to recruit her all her criminal charges will be dropped hopkins then signs off with the tag line this message will self destruct in five seconds actually with the departure of hopkins it was this disposable film that actually self destructed at this point in seville hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of jewel heist and subsequent car chase where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of mountain road he also falls for her when this was only supposed to be business deal and learns that she is valuable because her ex boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to ck her the imf team then inject location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go ck him as she leads them to his hide out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort the south african hugh stamp richard roxburgh robert towne the screenwriter who contributed to the first mission who is noted for doing chinatown writes colorless pedestrian script one that fails even to be funny in camp way the terrorists who aim to rule the world are interested in owning 51 percent in biotech company and in getting stock options as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote insuring that they will make billions on the stock ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah with his only conflict being who is more important to save first ethan does this rescue against all odds as he finds way to penetrate security tight biotech company fight it out with sean and the other terrorists and rescue nyah who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean getting it as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on motorcycle using kick boxing winning shootout throwing full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists making some more use out of that peeling mask bit and by being completely fearless and larger than life while he kick everyone ass if was only entertained by this could have lived with it but this film was so badly made that it was like watching highlight film of basketball game seeing only the slam dunks but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast in any case this is critic proof film and will in all probability do well in the box office as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into
capsule john the baptist is sent from heaven to see is the world is worth saving he must find some sign of hope in the people of newfoundland this is little more than tv skit in movie form it is watchable and apparently will be released to theaters in canada but it is unlikely to be seen on the international market it is diverting but hardly serious piece of cinema to +4 minor spoilers in this review written and directed by john doyle john the baptist sent to st john newfoundland gets an invitation to live with family that extraordinary hospitality for some reason does not count as reason for hope script has lot of holes friend who adopts john is surprisingly militant and is planning actions to destabilize wall street john does look middle eastern but somehow one expects john the baptist to be more dramatic there is conspiracy in the vatican riding on the result of the visit though that result seems small compared to the end of the world big yucks like seeing nun give the pope pedicure and evil pope aid praying to mendes goat in large part satire of life in newfoundland taking licks at things like the poor produce the one good tomato in grocery by virtue of miracle must have fallen off the truck to toronto based on 20 minute short film
as the twin surfer dudes stew and phil deedle lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother yanking out his iv he uses it like water pistol to soak his brother face this bit of lame physical humor is typical of disney meet the deedles movie more to be endured that watched stopped looking at my wife during the screening since every time did she start sticking her finger in her throat and she right it is that bad directed without any imagination by steve boyum whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction the film limps along at best boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts stunts and more stunts amazingly for someone with his background he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones and we have car go off the road five different times maybe more but who counting and then there is the script by james herzfeld whose only other film tapeheads from decade ago was so awful that it is considered cult classic meet the deedles however is painfully bad rather than laughably bad it will probably be in and out of the theaters like tornado and is in no danger of becoming classic anything herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes your geyser geezer and like to put deedle in her haystack as the movie opens the twins who at one point describe themselves modestly as walking kodak moment are celebrating their 18th birthday as they ride parasail high above the waters of waikiki truant officer pursues them on his jet ski as heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid back beach bums into men as they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone they ve got their surfboards skateboards and hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire their camp has gone out of business but they are mistaken for new park rangers the rest of the movie has them fighting the park overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as deranged ex ranger played by dennis hopper who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration scheduled for later in the week hopper who has made some wonderful movies carried away being recent favorite does have propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material this isn his worst acting but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he ever been in steve van wormer and paul walker as stew and phil give lifeless performances the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is cute little prairie dog named petey even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull to add insult to injury hennings is fond of inappropriate close ups which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog put ten foot pair of lips on the screen and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said although boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie stunt of lying on your back on skateboard while negotiating busy and twisting mountain road they make it look like so much fun that sure many will try some variation of the stunt how could this possibly be worst asks phil just when you suspect it can the movie takes turn further downhill its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag after phil girlfriend digs up big mount of moist soil they suck in long worm like the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp their lips finally meet in kiss as they pull back their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested meet the deedles runs about an hour and half it is rated pg for little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around and up my son jeffrey and his friend nickolas both almost gave the show they both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives jeep and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo
