moviemaking is lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post salary cap era you ve got to know how to allocate your resources every dollar spent on free agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers in the nfl this leads to teams like the detroit lions who boast superstar running back with huge contract but can only field five guys named herb to block for him in the movies you end up with films like spawn with huge special effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical siyah compact cars is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit except that sanders doesn have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages but like the lions star jackie doesn have anybody to block for him almost every cent that invested in jackie chan movie goes for stunts and as chan does his own stunts the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors chan directs scripts and dubbing and supporting characters not to mention the hideous title sequence this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain chan first release in this country rumble in the bronx was supposedly set in new york but was filmed in vancouver and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible heck jackie doesn even have enough money for haircut looks like much less personal hairstylist in condor chan plays the same character he always played himself mixture of bruce lee and tim allen master of both kung fu and slapstick fu jackie is sent by the un to retrieve cache of lost nazi altin in the north african desert and is chased by horde of neo nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs one of the things like about jackie chan movies no political correctness he is joined by three women who have little to do except scream jackie save us and misuse firearms the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere and he more pathetic than evil en route we have an extended motorcycle chase scene hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel with the neo nazis and two confrontations with savage natives once at the secret desert base there is long chop socky sequence followed by the film centerpiece wind tunnel fight that even better than the one in face off this is where the money was spent on well choreographed kung fu sequences on giant kevlar hamster balls on smashed up crates of bananas and on scorpions ignore the gaping holes in the plot how exactly if the villain legs were broken did he escape from the secret nazi base and why didn he take the key with him don worry about the production values or what exactly the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara just go see the movie operation condor has pretentions of being raiders of the lost ark knockoff but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him with lawrence kazdan screenplay john williams score spielberg directing and george lucas producing condor might be an a+ movie however you ve got to go with what you ve got and what you ve got in jackie chan is something special talent that mainstream hollywood should could and ought to utilize
ve noticed something lately that ve never thought of before pseudo substance hollywood faking deep meanings in their films have you ever seen movie that you really enjoyed then when you look back you realize there was something missing more and more filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being great film but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff not trying to say city of angels is that bad it had lot going for it but somewhere along the way it faltered somehow underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all there was gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography the predictable ending that shattered our hopes even though we saw it coming only added to the disappointment but for over an hour city of angels is well worth the time nicolas cage is seth guardian angel who like hundreds likely thousands or even millions of other angels spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life meg ryan in her most subdued performance yet plays maggie doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we re fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive after losing patient on the surgery table these questions envelope maggie and seth the angel who was there to oversee the patient transition into the afterlife is immediately captivated by the doctor he begins following and observing maggie falling more and more in love with her everyday angels who we quickly learn are not and never were humans can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire seth adoration is too much to resist and eventually he does appear to maggie quite regularly although such thing seems taboo among the angelic community the angels are interestingly presented all of them dressed in siyah and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing beyaz entities but it nice touch that never seems like mere attempt at uniqueness cage is wonderfully versatile actor think face off raising arizona and it could happen to you what combo who slips into the role of heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once it nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire the two aren very comparable to each other but they both deviate from her usual intelligently ditzy romantic comedy roles and it an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy but even though the two leads do an impressive job it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye it shame that with so much going for it city of angels falters so much in its final stages leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there they just didn know quite how to get to it they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on remember and convey to others thru word of mouth so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is glorious masterpiece they sure leave us with disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths based on the german film wings of desire that being the english title of course city of angels is ninety percent success enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings even the devastatingly disappointing ending most movie goers the non cynics anyway will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized nonetheless city of angels is beautifully captivating which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate delve into rich emotional territories
there something about ben stiller that makes him popular choice among casting directors these days stiller currently has three projects in circulation and what other actor can lay claim to that he in there something about mary which still haven seen and he in the acerbic your friends neighbors playing talkative sexually frustrated drama coach called jerri now there permanent midnight in which stiller plays another jerry this one heroin addicted television writer last name stahl there also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug addiction pictures the minute they ve proved themselves commercially ewan mcgregor springs to mind who after successful turns in emma and brassed off received greater respect and admiration for his mind blowing realization as renton in danny boyle transatlantic junk fest trainspotting the philosophy appears to be simple one if you want em to be taken seriously make em do drugs permanent midnight is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl successful hollywood writer who in the mid eighties had $5 000 week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and $6 000 week heroin habit habit in stahl own words the size of utah as stahl stiller contributes commanding performance unlike trainspotting which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse permanent midnight instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance one of the earliest observations in the film is casual reference to naked lunch author william burroughs who when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds so can shave stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in permanent midnight it so he can talk to his mother on the phone show up for work on time even pay his bills while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl the writing adapted from stahl autobiography by director david veloz is controlled and pointed permanent midnight shows how stahl moved from new york to to again in the author words escape the drug scene yeah right why he entered into convenient marriage with british tv exec elizabeth hurley so impossibly polite you swear her single profanity was dubbed and that he conceived child in between his random hirings and firings stahl narrates all this in motel bedroom to sympathetic lover called kitty norristown own maria bello with whom he spent some rehab time janeane garofalo is wasted and miscast as heavily bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped up wordsmith and that stahl himself playing jaded clinic counselor stiller unshaven burroughs take note and with lots of mascara around the eyes has stahl stumble through the film looking like train wreck but to his credit never once pushes his pill popping needle jabbing performance over the top the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see permanent midnight dark comic and strangely absorbing study of assisted living
that thing you do tom hanks screenwriting and directorial debut that thing you do has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment fun lively and oh so nice it is the latter quality however that becomes hindrance for this 60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast that thing focuses on the wonders teen rock band from erie pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score major dance hit called of course that thing you do the group members are naturally diverse group there brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy johnathon schaech girl crazy lenny steve zahn the lead guitarist goofy geeky type known only as the bass player ethan embry and the film center guy tom everett scott the drummer who has aspirations in jazz along for the wonders ride to success is jimmy perpetually neglected galpal faye liv tyler hanks proves to be capable writer director deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 which hanks calls the last innocent year the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music which like the other recent period music film grace of my heart was expressly written for the film hanks himself had hand in writing four of the tunes but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled it still playing in my mind as write this it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors eliciting charming likable work from the entire cast most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler who is remarkable in delivering the film biggest and best dramatic moment the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early 60s they do not appear to be 90s grungers playacting retro yet for all the light frothy charms of that thing you do it nearly nice to fault while this unbridled innocence in film is refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting everyone is so happy basking in the glow of overnight success marvelling at it all except toward the end but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness ending on an appropriately feel good note there isn much of an edge throughout that thing the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks turn as the wonders manager and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it bland but little niceness goes long way these days and there no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do it just about impossible to hate it an inoffensive enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming if not singing that thing you do quite possibly for days to paraphrase passage from the song though try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play that thing you do

the computer animated comedy shrek is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups for children it offers imaginative visuals appealing new characters mixed with host of familiar faces loads of action and barrage of big laughs including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances apparently requisite in contemporary family films for adults it fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids all in all shrek is snappy ride although there are couple of points found disturbing but first the basics based very loosely on 1990 children story shrek follows several momentous days in the life of the title character rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using shrek is grumpy fellow living solitary life deep in the swamp until local nobleman disturbs his peace petty tyrant lord farquaad take away the awk in the middle and you have the basis of string of impolite one liners owns the land on which shrek resides he proceeds to turn the ogre yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle as result shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice pinocchio the big bad wolf the seven dwarfs and the three bears to name but few an enraged shrek storms to the castle only to find farquaad john lithgow ready to bargain lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from snow beyaz has shown him the way all he has to do is rescue damsel in distress and make her his wife the mirror unveils three choices in presentation straight out of the dating game when snow beyaz is shown the cheeky announcer purrs even though she lives with seven men she not easy farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona cameron diaz and offers shrek deal if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon protected lava moat filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest accompanied by motor mouthed donkey eddie murphy determined to make the green grump his best friend they finally hook up with the princess only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet for the matter the dragon offers few surprises as well the movie references great many other flicks from babe that ll do donkey that ll do to the graduate but the lion share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney the public domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits pinocchio is referred to as possessed toy and when shrek spies sleeping snow beyaz in his cabin he bellows get that dead broad off the table but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad royal domicile which closely resembles certain magic kingdom from its souvenir stands and queue lines to display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in relentlessly peppy tune that sounds lot like it small world which brings me to disturbing point number one laughed at all the disney swipes but found the mentality behind them bit sad the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer here suggestion for the two boys grow up put the past behind you there room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can play nice then go to your rooms the other area found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad beyond all the irreverence shrek actually has message people should learn to look beyond physical appearances because true beauty lies within it lovely notion but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad diminutive stature do we really need family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable the pompous selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him target for zingers adding short jokes is simply mean still shrek is rollicking good time the computer animation is mostly impressive although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky the voice work is strong particularly from eddie murphy the laughs come fast and furious and the moral tainted though it may be is good one to trot out clich shrek is fun for all ages parents though should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short tall skinny fat etc is bad thing

after having heard so many critics describe return to me as an old fashioned hollywood romance kept asking myself going into this movie what exactly is an old fashioned hollywood romance what made return to me old fashioned and old hollywood was it the tunes from sinatra etc legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on was it the glamorous sophisticated feel the charisma of the two leads even now can say that have gotten any closer to the real answer because haven see that many old fashioned hollywood romances don think any of the romances ve seen have been classified as such which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics return to me was old fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic the way perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider it was traditional magical we knew it couldn be too daring or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in it was romance told with such endearing simplicity tenderness and love from director bonnie hunt that it couldn help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings the film owes lot of what it has to bonnie hunt direction from the very first bird eye view of chicago zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland david duchovny accompanied by the return to me ballad by whom we can tell we re in for something sweet the scenes between the characters are endearing truthful with just hint of fantasy real people don act that way real people aren that nice we know all this and yet we want to believe in these folks existence the premise itself seems to have sprung out of fairytale but hunt rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with hint of the ethereal everything is ordinary yet beautiful in this film >from the festive little family restaurant to grace minnie driver and bob wardrobes from the eloquent not in hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen the most beautiful part return to me has done an excellent job of assembling together group of actors who blend in effortlessly as family the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist we care for them laugh with them cry with them we re concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father whatever hunt did she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors disappointingly david alan grier charlie however much like him was the most flatly written duchovny here does laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona with the help of his fellow co stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder instead we have normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of the files duchovny who is excellent at understatement and self deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet innocent grace with nothing but good heart to offer though an unlikely pair duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses while return to me functions remarkably as laugh out loud comedy romantic scenic tour through chicago and tearjerker the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife heart we already know that there going to be happy ending we feel like we spend the entire film however enjoyably in straight line going towards that point as result bob and grace click almost too quickly yes know she supposed to have his ex wife heart and everything it seems too effortless the main subject is love story and the family scenes love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters whose story might not have that much meat after all however in the spirit of return to me it won do to be too picky about how old hollywood tells its stories loved knowing that this was labor of love for bonnie hunt it shows the bottom line return to me is nothing remarkable and yet its sweetness sincerity and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn imagined
meet joe siyah reviewed on nov 27 98 starring brad pitt anthony hopkins claire forlani in meet joe siyah brad pitt plays death that all that really needs to be said but nevertheless will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in cave with plot description death decides to take holiday what with all the rigors of soul collecting and all and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it like to be human death assumes the body of brad pitt and from there much trouble ensues for one thing death as pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter played by claire forlani obviously this enrages hopkins because really what can death offer besides eternal damnation of course there is also sub plot about forlani ex boyfriend she dumps him for pitt trying to take over hopkins company meet joe siyah runs just under three hours ve always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics meet joe siyah is neither historical nor is it an epic though get the feeling martin brest the director desperately wants it to be every single scene in the movie goes on about minutes too long and the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should severe editing job could have made this movie excellent instead of just good which is what it is pitt an actor normally loathe is actually quite engaging as death believed his performance and could see why forlani character would fall in love with him have to agree with roger ebert though who found it hard to believe that an entity that been around for all time wouldn know what peanut butter was that has nothing to do with pitt performance of course but it is little distracting hopkins gives his usual excellent performance he able to portray the angst of man who knows he has very little time left without making him an obnoxious whiner and in her first major studio role claire forlani is surprisingly good she has sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her so meet joe siyah is good movie hampered by it ridiculous running time had the film been cut by an hour or so have no doubt that would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review
as any sociologist will attest your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives but if your upbringing is marred with violence hate and dysfunctionality then your journey towards happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome `affliction explores how man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood the man in question is wade whitehouse nick nolte here is man who is like any other citizen on the surface he is productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me but as you scratch beneath the surface something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head we see that he is mean tempered person he has hard time taking control of his emotions which usually gets the better of him he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be gentle person but something is sparking tendency towards violence he also has tremendous problems with relationships he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter but his bearish persona and stature alienates her he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him his demeanor also puts his relationship with local townsgirl sissy spacek at risk she tries to remain true to him and supportive but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point finally he is spiteful and vindictive as rejected father he initiates custody battle that seems hopeless as the town only police officer he issues speeding ticket to man whose father has just died we can see that this is man that is both afflicted and living with pain he is prisoner and slave to it he is moving towards level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension what kind of force can move man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him we learn that the answer is his father james coburn this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks to heighten the father churlishness the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by very frightened person very effective today wade dad is quite elderly but still manages to instill fear into grown man the influence that the father possesses is inescapable and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade the result is every son nightmare becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be this is terrifically presented piece of psychological drama and nolte turns in strong performance as man whose pain seems to become detriment as well as necessity he hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father coburn displays heft as the bitter dad but it most certainly not saturday night friendly fare there nothing light or fluffy about this film that may turn many moviegoers away but it certainly worth noting that this is well acted drama showcasing nolte and coburn raw acting talents
in brief best bleak comedy film since heathers full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture go see it so prepared for this film by watching moving interview on hard copy with pam smart the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980 hard copy diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for smart replied that she thought kidman character came off as dumb vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal smart was convicted and given life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband smart got point it wouldn be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version however given choice between the mass media happening of the real event and the fictionalized movie would definitely opt for the later real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart while pretty and alluring is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman to die for begins in town called little hope new hampshire the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being on tv of course one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry played by matt dillon but with little imagination some charm and raw sex appeal and rather novel approach to junior achievement our heroine manages to overcome the nay sayers in her life at least temporarily kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows wonderful flair for comedy in this picture her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates kidman knows star making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven post feminist uber temptress from hell she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue which kidman delivers in unselfconsciously funny way at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister in law you know she knowingly exclaims gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head her husband beams at suzanne profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven folks the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix he plays jimmy burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne sexual favors kidman character vapid though she is is sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen slackerhood as envisioned by tabloid tv of course his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of kid who knows that he ain going anywhere ever phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne someone who actually noticed him gus van sant drugstore cowboy my own private idaho direction is first rate he keeps the pacing in this not quite thriller snapping along van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to get it without stopping to explain what is funny about this all american story the screenplay by buck henry is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines ve heard since heathers henry story is blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just few characters henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is crisp and funny mini classic danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick or treat parties all in all wonderful production well worth your seven bucks to die for columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman matt dillon joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard rated for language and mature themes respect the not for under 14 rating stars go see it
the second jackal based film to come out in 1997 the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland and is directed by man who hailed from joblo own alma matter concordia university in montreal canada the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal but does not pretend to be 100% factual plot naval officer ramirez quinn gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal in order to put an end to the actual militant radical activities he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to tee ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this assignment and soon finds himself wrapped up in true web of international terrorism intrigue and double personality syndrome which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states critique great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two hour runtime admittedly wasn huge fan of any of the main actors in this film and didn expect much from this movie beforehand but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments as well as mostly plausible and absorbing story line the first hour is mostly just build up of things to come and does offer great characterization of the jackal but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and sweet ending quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal but didn offer anything extraordinary in my opinion sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they ve played in both of their respective careers of late but nonetheless appeared to relish the cold heartedness of their chosen characters didn like performance put forth from quinn wife in this flick but then again she doesn show up in most of the film so that wasn so bad did however enjoy director duguay interesting style and cinematic vision this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer thought that was neat having said that didn think the first hour needed to be as long as it was and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the fake jackal met with the real jackal girlfriend without much retrospection on her part but all in all not too many complaints in movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre little known facts ben kingsley real name is krishna banji he stands was born in scarborough england and won the best actor honor in 1982 academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal canada joblo haven of restfulness donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland is canadian and apparently still owns place in the north of montreal
the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now it mu5t be found so what exactly is the fifth element after seeing luc besson ambitious much shrouded in secrecy science fiction fantasy could not help but be let down by the actual answer which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think but what is far from letdown is the film as whole wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do create universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps the actual storyline is the most conventional dismayingly so element pun intended of the film speaking in the vaguest possible terms the basics of the plot are as follows in the year 2259 great force of evil threatens to consume the earth and only the four elements earth wind fire and water united with fifth element can stop it figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas bruce willis shady southern drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg the hilariously hammy gary oldman picking up where he left off in besson the professional priest ian holm and mysterious creature named leeloo milla jovovich all of the pieces come together in tidy and somewhat underwhelming and unsurprising fashion but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest what remains interesting and exciting however after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil director of photography thierry arbogast visual effects supervisor mark stetson and the crew at digital domain the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last the frenzied cityscape of new york with its vibrant day glo colors tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds and the swarm of cars cabs and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways is absolutely breathtaking to behold especially in wild car chase sequence early on in the film but it would not have been completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren equally as interesting and are they ever in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world from bulky robots to dog like mangalores the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean paul gaulthier best known for creating madonna pointy bustier get up in her blonde ambition tour gaulthier outlandish creations such as number worn by leeloo made entirely out of beyaz straps feel more at home in besson futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film while besson bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching mass audience for all its imagination certain things about the film may be bit too quirky and bizarre really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film ruby rhod chris tucker flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative he makes raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress sporting blonde hairdo in the shape of hair dryer speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed at first this character hyper energy is funny but the act wears out its welcome very quickly not irritating but just as strange is musical number by blue skinned alien chanteuse diva maiwenn lebesco who sings and dances an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno the tune as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra innovative score is haunting but it is also completely jarring then there are the campy touches of humor besson and co scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout which too often are silly and forced comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny to boot the story weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element while still visually and aurally spectacular the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be the big serious dramatic climax was met with more than few snickers and it ambitiously strives for profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward as such at the end there is sense that there was something bigger at work here that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself who told me in the lobby following the screening imagine that the filmmaker watching the film with the enemy the critics that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half now titled mr shadow is still waiting to be made still despite the story problems the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson rarely does filmmaker original vision come to the screen in all its audacious undiluted glory it is fascinating example of how of one artist fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams

capsule earthy experimental difficult shockingly frank even for 1997 and ultimately refreshing story of siyah man on the run from the cops the first few minutes of sweet sweetback baad asssss song yes checked that the correct number of ss are without dialogue just eerie montages of sounds young boy obviously malnourished is taken in and fed up by several loving mother surrogate figures then one of them takes the boy to bed for sexual initation underneath the title credits that far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life something we re not used to seeing on screen this is one tough movie to swallow no matter who you are but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences the plot is simple but not simpleminded sweetback hassled by two beyaz cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on siyah man breaks his bonds and runs like hell along the way he moves through good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in more serious light in the movies or at all for that matter the slums the missions the ghetto in other lesser movies sweetback would be machine gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over pile of bodies in this one we get taken on kind of tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted ssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated by an all white jury as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns and it hardly surprising why there good deal of sex in the movie but it handled in way that unsettlingly frank frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie in one scene sweetback visits friend house in the hope of getting sanctuary there and the other man chats him up while on the toilet we re not used to coming this close to people in real life let alone in the movies especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous the movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles hands one scene in which man is interrogated by the cops is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off gun inches from his ears and suggest his deafness through cleverly edited soundtrack another note ssbas is not so much anti white that would be too easy as anti authority and as the movie goes on to demonstrate authority exists in many forms governments churches and even the paranoid inside of one own mind ssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom and it looks like we could use little more of that in our movie diet god knows
know what would do with $4 million if found it in previously undiscovered airplane crash site especially if were with jacob and lou huh well in any event that is the situation hank paxton finds himself in he and his dim witted brother jacob thorton and tubby friend lou brent briscoe come upon large bag of cash inside plane wreck against his better judgement hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities the rest of the film is question of who is going to die to keep this secret and is it worth it simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things clay pigeons and even fargo and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle oh and its much better than any of those sam raimi took departure from his normal freak show horror monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do think raimi knew he had winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on natural flowing course one of the film components can be linked to recurring theme in terrence malick the thin kirmizi line in malick three hour bore thon he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to field of flowing grass small bird or flowing body of water sure there were obvious metaphorical connections but there was no subtlty to his efforts raimi does fine job of tying in fox in chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters think most viewers may miss the comparison but it is very intriguing ingredient in the film and then there billy bob thorton who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood if it can continute to produce people like thorton hollywood will be ok he gives fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade but is is just as complex if not more so jacob is slow and simple and yet we so often see him deep in thought wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say or didn know how to say or if he was just taking long time to think about the thing he just said here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry though the plot is somewhat unoriginal it has very appealing new twist in its characters paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group far cry from chet in wierd science perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice giving wife but she certainly doesn do anything ruin the picture simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un redeeming but at least this one has an important message unlike so many of its counterparts
in some regards making movie is like trying to stretch rubber band as far as you can without breaking it try too hard and it snaps but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther in simon birch director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique he takes advantage of caution and poise but also risks his movie with few bold steps in the end he not only holding an unbroken band but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such fine feature there no doubt about it the film that johnson has crafted is rich he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown maine leaves turn bright orange in the fall the grass is lush green pure beyaz snow falls in the winter and the sky goes on forever the characters continue that turn our two leads are simon birch ian michael smith and joe wenteworth joseph mazzello simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital and by age twelve he only two feet tall joe is the bastard son of rebecca ashley judd and by age twelve he ready to know who is father is naturally the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball in wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith simon birch is convinced that he god instrument and there must be reason he so small joe doesn quite buy it but he sticks by simon the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other only true friends early on the two meet up with ben goodrich oliver platt rebecca new boyfriend and although the bond isn immediate ben and the two boys develop liking for each other both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters deep likeability the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon testament to the acting jobs of both finally jim carrey gives cameo as the adult joe in the present day and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show mark steven johnson sense of drama and writing is fantastic the script is loosely based on john irving novel prayer for owen meany but it so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from based on to suggested by along those same lines it almost unfitting to compare the two johnson uses tension humor atmosphere and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions by no means has he developed project of similar popularity gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in few weeks but the winning idea remains the same simon birch is different look at different life and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come in the present however it an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take look at
it fact that good thriller or action movie doesn need violence to be good or worth watching all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails and what kind of violence could be more efficient than global thermo nuclear war and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon computer whiz kid david is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades but after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game he wants to be the first to play it instead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad with the help of jennifer girl in his biology class he starts to play nice game of nuclear war with wopr war operation plan response top notch computer at the time but now hardly faster than my own computer remember being 12 and watching this at the cinema it was very efficent at giving you scare in those days and that hasn changed of course nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in 1983 wouldn be surprised if this gave people nightmares hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon broderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers although her interest in david remains mystery but the rest of the actors are by no fault of their own restricted by the script to play one dimensional grownups david parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the 1980s movies like secret admirer porky or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr strangelove if for no other reason you should see this movie to enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days david uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers the modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on far from any 56k modem my guess is that it some kind of 2400 bps modem the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum the big computer at norad has lot of flashing lights just like those you see on star trek or any old sf movie but it hardly impressing compared with what you can get today what are the lessons we can learn from wargames make sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers thank you whoever it was for giving us graphical user interface when we use our computers
there exists litany of differences between successful action movie and successful suspense movie action movies are typically devoid of plot other than simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full circle for fans of both genres however realism is key action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie end on this advice director john frankenheimer the island of dr moreau strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller ronin the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing considering the fare that fallen into the same category over the last few years the script written by zeik in his big screen debut approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission impossible two years ago certain number of people will be lost by this but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times frankenheimer masters the script with poise and tells us dark but stoically realistic tale of group of post cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here and ronin becomes better movie because of it robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex spy sam man who called to france to help shady operations controller named dierdre natascha mcelhone recover package the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast especially once the requisite double crossing begins and its role is skillfully penned by zeik at times however zeik tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission impossible de niro might easily become tom cruise the package might become cruise computer disk fortunately the focus here is almost entirely on the package whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double cross and why it happened the action content is impressive and it lives up to the hints given in previews the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness ronin does take degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish but even the uninitiated will be able to keep grasp on most characters mand subplots the suspense tapers off considerably by the end bit of drawback because of its height at the movie open considering these factors it good to see that ronin was project that turned out well and it another good bet this month since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months it definitely worth the visit
when first heard of contact the hype was building it up as sci fi blockbuster now with that in mind coupled with the knowledge of jodie foster involvement in the project thought what in the world is foster doing in sci fi blockbuster as it turned out my expectations were completely ified and turned topsy turvy robert zemeckis back from the euphoria created by his last film forrest gump once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit don get me wrong contact is sci fi but with definite difference based on the late carl sagan novel of the same name the story delves itself in questions on science and god fact and faith allie foster is radio astronomer she spends her time listening to the stars via ultra huge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system her passion for `long distance communication is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of ham radio system hobbyist radio communication device which her late father bought for her scene which particularly strengthens the audiences view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her late mother through the ham radio system in which her father replied not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that now allie research is based on the seti project search for extra terrestrial intelligence in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation her work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government which considers it waste of taxpayer money and politically unviable her supervisor tom skerritt pulls the plug on seti undaunted allie managed to gather loyal group of `believers and eventually found funding from large private corporation the following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day she caught an emission of seemingly intelligent repeating sound wave the news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers cultist the media and of course the government the situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission as the world join forces to build this transport allie is desperate to be the one to go she enrols herself among few hopefuls to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation her eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president spiritual advisor mcconaughey allie being an atheist result of her belief in fact and science refuses to budge upon questioning at this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president spiritual advisor strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey from the very first meeting scene it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects foster being person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith hope and the power of the unseen the meeting of their worlds added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless many people who read the synopsis of this film would find it tad too ridiculous but by actually immersing yourself in it gives you an entirely different perspective one which is free from bias and pre conceptions zemeckis and his team of screen writers have done remarkable job in telling this tale through film contact works by not delving in controversy but rather touches the thinking audience urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith whether one can actually find compromise within consider contact as one of the must sees for this year
with the success of the surprise hit alien directed by ridley scott sequel was inevitable in fact after watching the first film sequel was wanted particularly by this reviewer handing over the director chair to recent box office gem james cameron who had only made two films previous to this one pirahna ii surprisingly dull film and terminator making cameron household name the alien series got face lift of immense proportions instead of being suspense science fiction film cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created film like aliens comes along only once in while and when it does audiences are usually unprepared for it never saw this movie in theaters but wish could have the terror and fright must have been unimaginable most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear aliens is an action film unlike any have ever seen with science fiction plot cameron gives aliens added testosterone pumping up the action and fire power from the original film in fact aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero or heroine as the case may be never have we had more sympathetic hero in an action film and never have seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about placing woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual but because of weaver presence woman is the only suitable hero aliens begins 57 years after alien ended lieutenant ellen ripley weaver is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens but the company is doubtful they explain that colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left despite stern warnings from ripley the company remains rigid and won call the families back however when the company loses contact with the colony ripley story seems much more feasible one of the company directors carter burke paul reiser wants to gather team to travel to the planet this team includes buff private vasquez jenette goldstein questionable corporal hicks michael biehn and loyal android bishop lance henriksen burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony arriving on the planet the team finds most of the human life extinguished in cocoon type environment the only survivor is 12 year old rebecca newt jorden carrie henn ripley finds this chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become and she becomes newt surrogate mother ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened and soon all hell breaks loose aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott version it also multiplies the number of aliens in general alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member except ripley who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens and as result the chills are incredibly heightened then again this is james cameron the guy who has given us true lies and terminator judgment day he is the best action director out there topping renny harlin who directed cliffhanger and only he could create something as terrifying as this film it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes and aliens has the motherload with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion can recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout never dropping for moment just when you think the movie is over something else will occur and it starts right back up again with seemingly endless conclusion aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen using flawless special effects the climax is exhausting leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety of course for film of this genre to work properly the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see aliens is completely realistic even decade after its initial release the special effects are wonderfully seamless with terrifying alien to go with them one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music composed by cameron regular james horner horner has created terrific score receiving an oscar nomination for his work not only that horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film or science fiction film ever and that includes 2001 space odyssey which was mainly compilation of well known composers in fact the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music the production design is incredible which also happened to snag nomination from the academy dark corridors lit by kirmizi lights are very impressive but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well lit locations normally film will be very dark in order to scare viewer aliens uses lights to scare the viewer then of course is the cinematography which uses point of view shots along with video feeds in order to build suspense some of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley surprisingly the acting is not only above average for this genre but some of the best sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard edged persona weaver soars above the rest in this film but she is supposed to carrie henn gives an above average performance for child developing three dimensional character from her quiet attitude lance henriksen is terrific as bishop showing that androids don always have to be flat characters jenette goldstein shows fair amount of enthusiasm with her role and steals several scenes of her own though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn fighting michael biehn gives very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film however biehn does good job making it seem original again paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director but reiser manages to pull it off quite well however still see him as paul on tv mad about you very good cast which also includes bill paxton and william hope highlights this action film making it stand out from others aliens is rightfully rated for violence gore language and terror aliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre as alien was more of suspense horror film aliens pumps up the stakes and cameron directs it with professional quality cameron certainly knows how to make good action film but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen technically astonishing aliens only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed aside from this you probably won experience anything like aliens for quite while
the film magnolia can be compared to simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially from humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness whether this companion is distant family member or spouse each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one magnolia is clever well thought out film from prodigy director writer paul thomas anderson of boogie nights fame the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make magnolia memorable however what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories the film is never confusing anderson control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of magnolia scenes drag on too long any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn get boring it is obvious that anderson put lot of time into connecting each subplot this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees for example cop john reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall daughter melora walters who once went on date with reilly the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes races and genders suffer anderson explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get the performances in magnolia are perfection this is classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting anderson allows many of hollywood best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best character acting all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in feature length film worth noting is tom cruise who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into funny but depressing tour de force performance he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints the only problem had with the acting was that few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon character as phillip baker hall wife she seemed to be thrown in towards the end and felt very little sympathy for her because had not seen her enough earlier in the film magnolia uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only few hours to see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has keen sense of diversity diversity is what makes director successful for long period of time predict lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future
good will hunting is two movies in one an independent take on the struggle of four boston pals and traditional hollywood prodigy child film complete with upbeats downfalls sporadically moving situations and plenty plenty of shtick unusually directed by gus van sant good will hunting overcomes the banalities of its story by affirming the emergence of fresh new talent the film stars matt damon as will hunting as mathematical rebellious whiz kid inadvertly discovered by college professor stellan skarsgard who places him under psychological supervision with robin williams in nutshell that it the core of the good will hunting is damon who infuses the script co written by chasing amy ben affleck with just the right amount of warmth sensitivity and humanity to accentuate his position as refreshing multi talented performer but it the acting that hits the mark and damon hits all the right notes flying over robin williams deja vu role awakenings was written all over this as devastated shrink who has closed all contact with society due to his wife tragic death damon effortlessly blends the carelesness of gregarious confused thug with the absorbing ingeniousness of someone like einstein his rich complex character is the pulp of good will hunting everything else pales in comparison good will hunting exposes the lack of profoundness of deliberately schmaltzy storytelling but unlike little man tate or phenomenon it doesn set up its story in siyah and beyaz point to point be manner but as the saga of an extraordinary individual whose feasibility for success doesn automatically signify he must make easy familiar choices like the protagonists in the aforementioned
in arguably the most anticipated movie this century george lucas has achieved very mixed reaction to sure blockbuster despite the fact the script and plot is bit of let down the entire movie on the whole can be considered milestone in technical excellence in the sound and special effects department in terms of characters by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala natalie portman whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age she is one hot babe who defines true woman leadership she not only has presence but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination no thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up plan to do anything the young obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor who has bad hair day in every scene gets to kill bad guy in the end but lacks love interest to make him desirable sort of hero in fact all the jedi knight are bit asexual there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners mean it would be interesting to see yoda girlfriend for change if he has one not much better is qui gon jinn liam neeson who mostly broods and has better hair do than obi wan but only to find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life also fascinating is george lucas metoclorian theory which claims that micro organisms live within our cells and tie us to the fabric of the universe and it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly powerful in the force more humerous are the claims to the immaculate conception of darth vader no doubt concept stolen from the christian faith except there will be no christmas to celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the force overall an experience which is not to be missed because of the very fact that it predecessor almost command viewing of this inferior successor by all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenomena but an adequate addition to the clan watch out for the next one it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala and anakin skywalker who believe should be portrayed by leonardo di caprio

after the press screening of moulin rouge stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues everyone seemed bit numb understandable after sitting through barrage of often incongruous sounds and images pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production while woman who flat out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye when one fellow quietly stated ve never really been fan of musicals the statement surprised me because even though the story is told almost completely through song didn think of it as musical there is so much going on in moulin rouge that musical seems too small term to cover it moulin rouge is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience australian director baz luhrmann the man behind strictly ballroom and romeo juliet fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork opulent imagery and songs ranging from the sound of music to smells like teen spirit sumptuous and beautiful vulgar and overdone moulin rogue travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the random setting oh and it has story as well it was 1899 the summer of love christian ewan mcgregor is penniless young writer newly arrived in paris to write about truth beauty freedom and love where he encounters group of bohemians led by henri de toulouse lautrec john leguizamo christian meets satine nicole kidman courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue and his world transforms from siyah and beyaz to technicolor at once fragile and vivacious the dazzling red haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well which is quite hindrance for someone in her profession working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler jim broadbent christian writes an opus modestly named spectacular spectacular zidler quickly finds backer the wealthy duke of monroth richard roxburgh but there catch the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine as if all that isn enough satine has cough and while cough in the real world probably indicates cold it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land like teeter totter moulin rogue moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime one of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night becoming part of defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from book of fairy tales together they dance while serenaded by the man in the moon alessandro safina provides the vocals apparently transported from the classic georges li silent film to guard the nocturnal sky other scenes merely traffic in everything and the kitchen sink overload the cavorting of toulouse lautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy accompanied by cartoon sound effects is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like bewitched beat into the ground of course sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind we never heard from baz to turn it down one of the actors told the los angeles times it was always more more the director even sent note to his cast reading dare you to make me say you ve gone too far the musical numbers reflect his attitude one knockout piece the elephant love medley incorporates the beatles all you need is love u2 in the name of love dolly parton will always love you and elton john and bernie taupin your song need more how about diamonds are girl best friend spiced with portions of material girl luhrmann cast offers wide variety of approaches that together add up to something messy but often wonderful ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian emphasizing the sincerity of the love struck poet mcgregor singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments once labeled the ice queen nicole kidman melts that characterization with sizzling yet tender performance she handles the songs adroitly although her voice sounds bit thin in the upper range veteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler wait until you see him perform like virgin as the buffoonish duke richard roxburgh proves to be the film weakest link although sure he was simply following instructions suspect moulin rogue will be one of those love it or hate it films while didn completely love it most certainly liked it lot over the course of year see well over 300 movies and most of them look like xeroxes of each other moulin rogue is an original and an original even flawed one is thing to be cherished
written by john grisham and robert altman as al hayes directed by robert altman some time ago young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of popular novel the novel was summer smash topping best seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads the only problem the novel wasn very good it was far more pulp than pulitzer but the director realized that no matter how pedestrian the prose this book really grabbed people that the author while not great writer was fantastic storyteller so he took on the project convinced he could make something happen on screen the director francis ford coppola the book of course was mario puzo the godfather the rest as they say in showbiz was history by bringing up the godfather don mean to suggest that robert altman the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material can you get any more questionable than john grisham depends on whom you ask but there no question that grisham work grabs people like puzo grisham is better storyteller than writer unlike fellow hack michael crichton who is good idea man but who can tell well constructed story from can of spam so something in grisham unpublished story of cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman who at 73 years old remains one of america greatest living filmmakers the result is gripping thriller that while falling short of classic cinema deserves its place in the altman canon >from its opening shot to the closing credits the gingerbread man is permeated with sense of dread with fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe this terrific sense of mood is classic altman touch witness said opening shot we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear we roll over the hills into the town of savannah then zoom in close on kirmizi sports car speeding over bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone right away we know that the driver of that car is in for few surprises pay attention boys and girls this shot was not conceived by john grisham but by altman this is what great director can do for questionable source material the sports car belongs to rick magruder kenneth branagh the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases magruder has just won high profile case and celebrates that night with catered party at his office outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses mallory doss embeth davidzt just as she realizes her car has been stolen driven by southern chivalry driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress magruder offers her ride home there he learns more about mallory life than he bargained for her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon robert duvall ted kyzynski style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter magruder perhaps influenced by mallory decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him is sympathetic to her plight and offers to help her get her father committed right after he sleeps with her of course this simple offer of help leads magruder down dangerous path with siyah end he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in mental hospital and for moment all appears well but then dixon crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup and suddenly magruder finds himself mallory and his own children in danger the cops won lift finger to help liberal attorney his only allies are his faithful assistant lois daryl hannah and his bumbling private eye sidekick clyde robert downey jr if this predicament wasn bad enough hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos altman may provide the atmosphere but branagh performance holds the gingerbread man together an accomplished actor when he isn directing himself in vanity productions branagh does fine job of making rick sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness or of egotism magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it and by then it too late as the plot unfolds magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are and life is never so bad that it can get worse if you re familiar with altman work you ll recognize several of his signature techniques characters are not introduced in establishing shots but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style and of course there my favorite altman technique the obligatory nude actress shot thanks to altman here are some of the actresses ve had the pleasure of seeing naked sally kellerman julianne moore madeline stowe even frances mcdormand and now can add embeth davidtz who looks quite healthy in the altogether the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film is it old school sexism or clever in joke you be the judge but back to the picture at hand in the hands of mere mortal the gingerbread man would have been routine thriller no better or worse than the countless others we ve all endured in the hands of master like altman it becomes an exercise in existential doom in its own way far more successful than scorsese cape fear remake which tried for the same result what may prevent it from enduring with altman greatest work is weak third act in fact there really is no third act in grisham story so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up but there are true moments of riveting suspense and great performances by branagh davidzt and downey jr more than enough to see you through that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are they probably wanted it to look more like time to kill and that my friends should make you very afraid
notting hill trailer is awful laughless schmaltzy montage the movie was desperately marketed to the anti phantom menace crowd the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter and it apparently worked perhaps the presence of julia roberts whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me had lot to do with notting hill opening weekend success but the film staying power is based on word of mouth allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill grant stars as william thacker travel bookstore owner who works and resides in tiny english district called notting hill into his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott roberts common thief some spilled orange juice and some stilted conversation leads to their first highly impetuous or is that improbable kiss days later william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of magazine journalist and so begins passionate albeit surreptitious affair aside notting hill portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate only anna celebrity or william lack thereof threatens to drive wedge between them richard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered and for at least its first half hour the picture beauty and the beast like scenario is romantic escapism of the highest order as with groundhog day or pleasantville while watching the high concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him herself in the lead it william ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna curtis who previously penned four weddings and funeral is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple situation is not enough to fuel two hours worth of entertainment so some of notting hill finest moments revolve around william eccentric friends and family by now dear reader you ve probably heard lot about rhys ifans performance as william imbecilic welsh flatmate yes he crowd pleaser walking sight gag but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair bound and appropriately named bella mckee the anguished waitress of naked or max tom mcinnerny her lousy chef of husband in the movie best sequence william anna and company sit around bloated from max latest concoction and hold contest the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life the scene ends only as british writer would end it if anything fantastic bits like these dull the main plot dramatic impact roberts and grant especially are appealing but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times four weddings suffered similar flaws and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common they re lonely worth noting in roberts and grant favour the ubiquitous just girl standing across from boy asking him to love her episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done notting hill is nonetheless enjoyable on the visual side of things especially appreciated michell playful changing of the seasons number if only and this is surprisinly minor gripe he had lopped off the egregious epilogue for story that thrives on what we bring to it the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up leaving our imaginations in the lurch
with the release of gattaca began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens or aliens in general hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films but what was usually lacking was good story and good characters and good acting etc contact being the exception and for some reason hollywood has never taken look at the aliens here on earth the closest that have seen anyway was 2001 space odyssey which made mankind an alien race themselves being dwarfed by the technology which they created now comes gattaca another film about technology reigning supreme except here on our planet the difference between 2001 and this one is simple gattaca is more frightening most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering using this premise writer director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills unfortunately due to lack of advertising fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office since seeing the film have been asking people if they have seen gattaca lately however have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca most people don even realize that it is film despite this fact surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it niccol film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter better produced and more realistic gattaca begins in the 21st century procreating is now done in petri dish and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it natural child birth is considered old fashioned we are introduced to jerome morrow ethan hawke an employee of the gattaca space program one of the directors of the program has been murdered and the main suspect is one vincent freeman the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love however after his birth and through several genetic tests doctors tell his parents that he will have 99% chance of weak heart as well as poor eye sight and short life span as result both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics anton loren dean is produced without flaws and the competition between brothers spawns vincent has dream to fly solo flight around the titan the 14th moon of saturn but because of his condition gattaca and society in general forces him to do menial labor around the company labeled an in valid vincent dream seems impossible until he meets black market dna specialist german tony shalhoub german introduces him to valid who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident jerome morrow jude law agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools urine blood skin and hair samples etc that he will need to get past gattaca tight security in exchange vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship after the murder however his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent eyelashes left at the scene of the crime irene cassini uma thurman is genetically flawed valid working for gattaca and she begins to fall in love with vincent jerome gattaca is one of the best science fiction films have seen in long time only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years contact and the arrival and gattaca will rank among them unfortunately whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects laden films it normally gets buried the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs the orange glow of gattaca scenes are impressive but the sets deserve most of the credit the sets are very well done creating futuristic sense but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers as we look at the designs we realize that these buildings aren too far into the future this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day the best thing however is the plot the story is more than your average sci fi thriller at its heart it develops theme which is never overpowering but is always present perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring would our society become bunch of soulless zombies maybe human nature is result of mankind flaws if we get rid of flaws do we get rid of dreams as well niccol intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against dramatic story or vice versa the power of the actors brings lot of credibility to flat characters while flat may sound like poor job on niccol part it actually enhances the meaning behind the story ethan hawke has developed into handsome adult actor giving his best performance of his lifetime so far his curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and valid peers uma thurman is well uma thurman her character is slightly underdeveloped but the story isn about her however thurman gives lot of depth to the flat character jude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character he provides several nice touches and his final scene is very touching and heartwrenching one loren dean gives nice performance in his well developed character dean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie alan arkin portrays one of the detectives with little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank still he does good job gore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles and berkeley also gives heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film gattaca is rated pg 13 for brief violent images language some sexuality and nudity despite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film wasn exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty it turned me off slightly but then realized that everything turned out the way it should have if this had been typical hollywood film it would have ended much differently however with all the mindless science fiction films out there it is nice to have film which doesn talk down to its audience especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding and instead it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want science fiction film with morals behind it whatever happened to giving the audience lesson while entertaining hopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca and hopefully audiences will too personal note to gladnick how dare you call this film the worst film of the year can even begin to image what film you do like that frightens me beyond anything
why do people hate the spice girls what exactly have they done wrong other than perhaps offend the fashion police so what if they are not great singers they ain singing opera folks its pop music who exactly is great singer judging by that opening paragraph it is obvious that like the spice girls they do what they do sing some catchy tunes and they do it pretty well they are able to carry that into their first film spice world spice world certainly isn great filmgoing experience what it is what the spice girls are all about fun songs and lot of girl power drawing from number of different films like the beatles hard day night spice world chronicles the week heading up to the girls first concert at london albert hall they get to tool around london in big ol bus driven by meat loaf and generally have fun in order to through semblence of plot into the film there is an evil tabloid publisher played by barry humphries better known to americans for about 15 minutes as dame edna remember her he wants to sabotage the girls concert so he can sell papers of course the point in movie like spice world isn plot the center of the film is the spice girls themselves ginger the recently departed geri haliwell posh victoria adams sporty melanie chisolm scary melanie brown and baby emma bunton each one has their own personality and perhaps the best part of the film look like they are having some honest to goodness fun something that can be said for lot of people in films today along for the ride are richard grant as their manager clifford and various other characters making quick cameo appearances including teriffic british actors like richard briers and stephen fry and every once and while roger moore pops up as the chief to spout odd koans added bonus he gets to in the words of craig kilborn dance dance dance watching this film was fun for the most part there are few slow segments but overly director bob spiers keeps things moving at quick pace with plenty of hummable spice girls songs in the background his camerawork is fairly pedestrian though the final concert number is done quite well with effective use of editing the look of the film promotes the high fun with the design of the spicebus being quite original and eye catching add in wall to wall spice girls music and this film is lovable romp if you don like the spice girls you won change your mind with this film but if you find them at least tolerable get ready to sit back and chill because the spice girls are here to entertain you and do it quite well spice world 1998 directed by bob spiers written by kim fuller music by the spice girls with geri halliwell victoria adams melanie chisolm melanie brown emma bunton richard grant claire rushbrook roger moore distributed by columbia pictures running time 92 minutes rated pg available on home video 29 june 1998

carolco pictures and dutch director paul verhoeven robocop came together to create the 1990 mega hit that is total recall the film is masterpiece of sets action and special effects action and science fiction just don get any better than this the story involves construction worker named douglas quaid arnold schwarzenegger who lives on earth with his beautiful wife lori sharon stone quaid is obsessed with mars and decides to go with the second best choice brain implant fake memory of two week vacation on mars while being implanted memory cap is triggered and the doctors realize that quaid memory has previously been erased now the people who did it are after him quaid must find out who he really is and why these people want him dead the plot unfolds at rapid pace explaining itself through great action special effects and twist after mind boggling twist it grabs you and never lets go this film is winner from beginning to end the plot is superb combining the best elements of science fiction and psychological mystery to create rip roaring saga schwarzenegger gives his best performance ever and the supporting cast is good too the action and stunts are terrific the sets are huge and elaborate with lot of attention payed to detail the music and sound effects are perfect for the film and really add certain level of impact to the action the make up effects by rob bottin the howling the thing and robocop are top notch not to mention extremely outlandish the visual effects by dream quest the abyss and industrial light and magic star wars trilogy jurassic park and terminator are phenomenal the visuals had such state of the art slickness that they won an oscar of course the film isn always realistic it more fiction than science for example it is true that body won explode in the vacuum of space but in total recall they do who cares it movie movies are supposed to entertain and in my opinion this film achieves an entertainment level in film that is so terrific it may be impossible to beat
for example in happy gilmore sandler plays rookie golfer trying to beat self confident jerk of pro if the star were any other comic that would be enough motivation to drive the movie but with sandler the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house that extra motive doesn make happy gilmore funnier movie it doesn really add any genuine emotional depth either in fact the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie but sandler philosophy seems to be if it token gesture why not make it nice gesture that is endlessly refreshing in the wedding singer sandler is right on track the fact that he wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story what kind of wedding singer he is is even less important david spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm he could make fun of the fat ugly or embarrassing people he meets at weddings and the story would be intact but sandler instead brings mature goodness to the character he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family robbie hart sandler doesn just sing at weddings he also gets the loners to join in and have fun and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding the day comes when robbie has his own wedding and he is stood up by his heavy metal bride the movie is set in 1985 robbie takes it hard he doesn sleep he doesn eat and he gets punched out at work when he sings love stinks at wedding julia drew barrymore who waitresses all the weddings in town gives him shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to eventually robbie starts rebounding toward julia he really likes her but she engaged her fianc is self confident jerk do see trend nope just formula who doesn deserve her but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand julia seems to like robbie too but she can leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc for the off chance that robbie might be serious about her you know the story you ve seen it million times before there always new way to tell it with new lovers new chemistry and new details but it the same story and sometimes it works the wedding singer works first of all the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective actually it not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one own romantic tension sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of jilted man struck with an unattainable love barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with sparks don fly when they kiss but they both seem right for each other second their love is mature they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction they re cute couple but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material instead they are both looking for someone meaningful someone to settle down with someone to grow old with at wedding robbie comforts kid throwing up in dumpster while julia sits by the repulsing situation is taken in stride as if the two were already parents caring for their sick child the 80s soundtrack and references play big part in this movie other critics liked this movie in part because of the 80s soundtrack liked it in spite of the soundtrack often the music and references felt forced for example robbie tells his ex fianc to get out of my van halen shirt before you jinx the band and they break up ha ha ha get it david lee roth did leave van halen or how about when sammy allen covert robbie chauffeur friend shows up at party wearing michael jackson jacket and get this single silver glove that exactly what mj used to wear all the time unfortunately making fun of generalizations about past era is too easy to be rewarding that not to say the movie isn funny screenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before billy madison and happy gilmore and the two make good combination herlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straight faced smart aleck style let hope herlihy and sandler stick together for few more projects because this movie really won me over with barrymore charm and sandler heart it was hard to go wrong
okay let me first say this is beavis and butthead movie if you do not like beavis and butthead do not go to see this movie however if you do like them recommened you get out right now and go see it the movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their tv they notice that it has been stolen and they vow to find it this wind their way through america searching for dallas she is woman they look for her because as they are searching for the tv they find drunk who wants them to do his wife well of course they think he wants them to score with her when actually he wants them to kill her and the fun starts their this movie is mix of funny gags that anly beavis and butthead could pull off it is quality entertainment that only fan of beavis and butthead would enjoy enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace even when they were crawling through the desert and thought the movie started to lag he manages to keep the laughs coming if you expecting changes from the show keep looking the same character the same voices the same everything from the show and that what makes it good you might think with movie from tv show you can change few things often times this spells disaster for films because the film makers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place
taking few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers the story centres around group of people who include brit simon askew and checkout girls claire holmes and ronna polley and the misadventures that they get into split into three chapters everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in film with much blacker edge in comedy than swingers although qt touch is evident in nearly every frame go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride liman who also photographed the film has deft touch with the camera and the film looks good the film also seems to have benefited from budget with the night club scenes in particular looking pretty good there twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get smirk the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life holmes one of the dawson creek cast show not particularly fond of displays much talent here and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make three dimensional character and never becomes caricature askew is slightly successful being rather obnoxious no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him but instead of funny annoying he just annoying he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer who gives an nice evil performance the script written john august is sharp and witty with good dialogue and some funny jokes it starts off rather slow however but in about twenty minutes the script has found it footing and just keeps getting better the stories are largely satisfying although occasionally there too much attention on one detail but not on another also some of the endings seem little forced and lucky still the cast have meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it it could of tried little harder in some parts however and these parts lag because this is gen xer movie the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany and go one is pretty decent unlike other gen xers movies go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue which is plus go is very easy movie to absorb into and the audience really starts feeling for these characters thankfully they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics like the heroine in 10 things hate about you they are who they are and they stay that way go is great fun and worthy follow up from the director of swingers ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride erm go to go guess
oliver stone latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents it three hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century stone doesn hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the beyaz house the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done at the same time he creates very human character brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics which is here pictured as wild animal he is simply trying to tame it but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the beyaz house as events run ahead of the president ability to control them stone doesn in any way apologize for nixon he blames not only nixon own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself the system that once set in motion behaves with mindlessness of its own nixon is modern shakespeare story saga about ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws there something almost majestic about the process as nixon goes down in this film there is no gloating but watery sigh as of great ship sinking sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding creating very emotional picture of the 37th american president joan allen magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette she is strong and loyal as mrs nixon the rest of the cast is equally magnificent including james woods walsh paul sorvino ed harris and bob hoskins everyone does serious and demanding job no one are disappointing stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy honest and determined he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element at times he is showing to siyah and beyaz showing flashbacks from nixon youth and childhood the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin robert richardson rich cinematography and john williams musical score create hectic and bizarre atmosphere the film only fault is that it bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers still it an honest and captivating solid piece of movie making

when left the theater after seeing david lynch lost highway remarked to fellow movie goer feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears in his first feature film in five years lynch delivers film second only to his debut picture eraserhead on the weirdness scale you won know what happened when it over though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses it is difficult to describe the plot of this film because it depends partly on how you interpret it can however describe what we see on the screen jazz saxophonist fred madison bill pullman and his wife renee patricia arquette whom he clearly suspects of infidelity receive series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep they are naturally enough more than little frightened and confused and it doesn help matters any when mystery man robert blake approaches fred at party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons house in scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving the next morning fred finds another videotape which to his and our surprise shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom he is convicted of her murder and sent to death row where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by young mechanic named pete dayton balthazar getty the perplexed prison officials release dayton whose life begins to intersect with fred in number of ways most notably his affair with alice wakefield arquette again blonde who is otherwise renee spitting image and another encounter with the mystery man would be giving away little too much to reveal any more but suffice it to say that lynch doesn offer any neat wrap ups nor does he put lid on the metaphysical confusion the cinematic demons of lost highway are out in full force from beginning to end this description might make lost highway sound like giddy exercise in haywire surrealism but in fact while there are traces of lynch weird sense of humor this film is anything but giddy most of the time on the contrary lost highway is dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther the film does not revolve around character investigating mystery rather the character is the mystery there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion distrust and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate deluded fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings on here we the audience are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this probably fred in my opinion and what in that case the other characters and events are meant to represent all of this proceeds appropriately in lynch typically slow paced idiosyncratic style as is often the case lynch relies on sound imagery and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story and in lost highway it works perfectly there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down hallway or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil song to the siren can be heard faintly in the background nothing is technically happening in these scenes yet they present vivid picture of man losing his grip just as effective as if not more so than the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity lynch direction and director of photography pete deming darkly lit cinematography serve to create nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story well most of the time anyway have to admit that was bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer attention because of its tie ins to the original mystery the main characters in this reality dayton well meaning but none too intelligent 24 year old sleazy gangster who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much stock character and his porn star girlfriend the blond arquette are nothing you couldn find in any of the two dozen pulp fiction wannabes fortunately the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements such as the strained awkward conversations between pete and his parents help to preserve the film spooky unnerving tone during this stretch lynch typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery are also somewhat overdone here it not exactly exploitative like almost everything else in this film the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off that said these minor flaws don prevent lost highway from attaining its place as one of the darkest most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years it is one way ride down the lost highway of disturbed mind and as such it is gripping intense and brilliantly effective

with team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft square pictures final fantasy inspired by the top selling game franchise is visually awe inspiring and groundbreaking no doubt you have never seen anything like this film and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved but why does such tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with problematic story wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting obviously the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail individual threads in the fabric individual strands of hair swaying wrinkles and pimples on skin incredible water effects overall the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue and the times when they don sync perfectly really stand out since the animation is usually so dazzling but you won spend much time dwelling on those gaffes as soon as you catch one the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering wow like the series of games final fantasy plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind hironobu sakaguchi it the year 2065 and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien phantoms whenever human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors the often invisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul for some unexplainable reason while many humans agree with plan by monomaniacal general hein james woods to blast the aliens with zeus cannon dr aki ross ming na and dr sid donald sutherland plan to build wave using eight collected spirits to counteract the phantoms and kill them off while the images serve the sci fi aspect of the film well the storytelling doesn it unfortunate because the plot seems so intricately thought out perhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script some could blame this weakness on the fact that it was japanese concept translated to english except two americans wrote the screenplay nevertheless the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes why do these aliens feed on souls if they can pass through bodies and ships how can humans hurt them with guns what is so special about the spirits that they would create force strong enough to destroy the aliens worse yet the dialogue is scripted to be either like science heavy star trek episode an installment of die hard or sappy love story depending on who doing the talking for the most part it bearable considering the genre but tedious speeches and cheesy lines don do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming who always has great cracks during tense moments but when the lights come up and the credits roll you re more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked there no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film you be living in fantasy world of your own if you expected much more

the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80 more practiced as cinematographer than director bava nonetheless sat in the director chair for beyond the door ii the project which turned out to be his last full length feature film alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci beyond the door ii is simply revelation in his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970 note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist rip off behind the door but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia this story focuses on dora women set upon by malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco the film opens with dora her son and second husband bruno returning to house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband suicide and her subsequent trauma years earlier they hope to put the past behind them but as small accidents start to befall dora usually while bruno is away on business she starts to suspect that marco played with uncanny ability by year old david colin jr is somehow involved in the strange goings on to reveal any more of the story would be unfair suffice to say that this artfully paced study of woman suffering nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot loads of atmosphere and solid acting though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english bava coaches surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi wife of famed italian horror director dario argento her character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora troubled soul the music by italian ensemble libra is also effective mixing odd sounding 70 rock with classic gothic piano sequences and there is at least one moment brilliantly engineered by bava that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair yet for italian horror the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal lamberto bava and francesco barbieri script is more concerned with deeper psychological terrors with themes of guilt and suffering with the notion that what we sow will shall somewhere somehow eventually reap scholars of the genre take note beyond the door ii is stylish chilling and essential
what is scary movie anyhow is it movie where person gets ripped to shreds is it where person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge possibly its some guy with hook who wants to know what you did last summer what ever happened to horror movies where the horror was in the atmosphere and in the characters movies like halloween and psycho which revolutionized horror genre forever but wait in 1973 came movie based on the bestselling book by william peter blatty entitled the exorcist the movie opened to rave reviews and scared audiences to death now in the year 2000 the exorcist comes back to the big screen in version you ve never seen complete with six channel digital surround sound and fifteen minutes of new footage never before seen as long as new ending chris mcniell is an actress living in georgetown washington with her twelve year old daughter regan while working on new film chris still stays close to regan but starts to wonder why her bed shakes at night and why regan starts to have convulsions all of sudden when chris finds out that regan is possessed by demon she shuns at the fact of it but considers getting priest to help her daughter father karras jason miller is the man they bring in his mother has just died and still in mourning he decides to help this little girl christ father karras and their nanny sharon kitty winn have to sit and wait until man shows up that man is the exorcist and that man will help this little girl excrutiatingly scary the exorcist is classic horror film which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death now we get to the experience the exorcist the way it was meant to be seen in director cut which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cut by friedkin at the time of the release for content and time new ending has been added as well and adds more of lighter feeling to the movie which prefer the original darker ending more the movie has also been remastered in wonderful six channel digital sound mix and is amazing the voices are all clear the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness as director friedkin has been well known for other films but his standout film is the exorcist nominated for several academy awards it one few but was somehow doubted best picture best actress ellen burstyn and best supporting actress linda blair who at the age of believe thirteen does wonderful job of being little girl alone possessed and unable to stop what is going on ellen burstyn think gives her best performance to date and can be seen currently in requiem for dream to which she is getting rave reviews for jason miller jason patrik dad is amazing as father karras and his performance will be forever embedded in my mind to me he is the character who makes the entire film float along was saddened when saw this film with an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at this movie in no way think that this movie is comical yes some of the stuff regan says is funny but they were laughing at her head spinning and the green pea soup come on people this is some creepy stuff anyway the re release of the film has managed to make $40 million dollars and is still going hopefully one day they re release it again in twenty years for more generations to come to enjoy
scarface remake of the 1932 film of the same name is very gripping and as far as know true to life story of how power and violence lead to corruption al pacino as tony montana for whom the movie is named also provides brilliant performance as cuban refugee who comes to america with less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly respected and feared drug lords in miami oliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles the film begins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans to set sail and head for the coasts of the united states many of these cubans had criminal records such as tony montana cocky fast talking man who has the look of crime nearly right after his arrival in miami tony is thrust into the gangster life when he participates in cocaine buy that goes awry along with his friend and partner manolo steven bauer tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms friendship with frank lopez robert loggia high roller in the organized crime field tony also begins to fall in love with elvira michelle pfeiffer who at the time was frank lover of course sooner or later in this industry betrayal and corruption amount into force greater than anything else and tony is one of the ones who fall victim to this force this is not before he becomes one of the most respected and often feared men in miami tony gets to the point where he cannot trust anyone and everyone he knows basically feels the same way towards him no one can trust him and basically no one does scarface although incredibly violent is one of the best crime films of its time and stands out as another great performance for al pacino although he did not receive any recognition from the academy for his performance it truly is very good one in fact his accent and facial movements alone are enough in my mind to win at least nomination although he did get golden globe nomination another element that stands out when someone mentions this film is the profanity figure tagged to the film boasts that the word fuck and it uses are uttered 206 times throughout the film which is apparently record the thing is the vulgarity fits rather well with the movie as odd as it sounds it true in the end scarface is very powerful film that hits home hard
the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for documentary they are making they disappear and their footage is discovered year later buried underneath the foundation of one hundred year old house from there things become little more complicated can say with absolute assurance that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me although know it was all staged mockumentary there no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you didn feel much upon initially watching it just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with friend ve gotten chills every time ve brought it up since then this is not movie that hits you right away instead this is movie that sits at the base of your spine waits until you think everything is okay then it slowly starts to creep it way up into your mind this is truly the most frightening movie have ever had the pleasure to watch the film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film so don expect any steadi cam shots or fancy camera work this is as real as it gets folks don recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though because guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera the performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not this is definitely movie that warrants home video viewing especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with standard home video camera the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape to film transfer done for the big screen word has it that special edition dvd with boatloads of extras hours of deleted scenes alternate endings commentary the sci fi channel special and others is being planned for release urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the dvd to rival all dvd know ll be first in line to buy one [r]
earlier this year the movie holy man opened to meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics real charmer of movie it possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience now at the end of 1998 comes waking ned devine comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter there no substantial difference between the two other than more refined atmosphere they strike all the same chords but still ned devine is movie worth seeing the plot is interesting and robust the latest lottery winner is ned devine jimmy keogh of tullymore ireland ned prize is over six million pounds but the shock of winning killed the poor old man and the check remains unclaimed enter jackie shea ian bannen and michael sullivan david kelly the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village the two men eventually find the ticket and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he actually ned the entire town can reap the benefits their only adversary is an ancient old woman eileen dromey who sees more profit in reporting the fraud ian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael jackie stocky and large is the brains behind the operation michael scrawny and short is the method man the two contrast each other delightfully and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience every viewer is sure to like both of them there are other minor subplots included as well such as an unlikely romance between local girl and the town pig farmer this appears quite inconsequential until the end and even with startling revelation it tad bit unnecessary overall waking ned devine has predictable outcome and plot twists are never really taken seriously the ending very hilarious and very ironic twist of fate somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout the kirk jones script is indeed off the cuff in way waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents warm friendly outgoing and jovial it the perfect kind of comedy real gem of tale that sets up trivial plot outline by which to introduce sympathetic cast of characters and string of jokes there nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than moment or two because the spirit of ned devine is lighthearted one indeed it one of the year best feel good movies 91 minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss
just in time for halloween and christmas the reissue of the nightmare before christmas couldn be more appropriate with all of the attention thrown to family films in recent years namely those starring pocket monsters and nickelodeon characters it high time we raised the intellectual level of children fare as well as the animation achievements of the movie studios with that in mind it was refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still retains the originality and freshness it had seven years ago nightmare is the story of one man quest to discover his true purpose in life to look beyond the accolades of his peers the achievements of his years and the praise of his ego jack skellington the pumpkin king of halloweentown is the main dude behind the halloween holiday for kids everywhere but during his reign as pumpkin king jack has somehow lost his understanding of his place in the world and the magic he creates with his halloween holiday after the completion of one particular halloween season jack walks with heavy heart and ends up discovering in the woods outside halloweentown grove of trees with doors to all of the other holidays in the world imagine his surprise to discover christmastown far more impressive and uplifting holiday than halloween surrounded by happy elves making toys and with good cheer all around upon his return to halloweentown jack decides to combine halloween and christmas together by kidnapping sandy claws employing all the residents of halloweentown to build toys for children he then aims to take over the role as primary joy provider and gift bearer to the children of the world in the hopes of rediscovering the zest for life he once had alas the co mingling of halloween and christmas creates disastrous results involving shrunken heads psychotic wooden ducks sleigh pulled by phantom dog with lighted nose and large sinister singing bag named oogie boogie tim burton the man behind such great films as ed wood beetlejuice pee wee big adventure and edward scissorhands is the creative force behind nightmare originally burton authored poem that became the basis of the storyline and he was jointly involved in the production design of the film though many mistakenly assume he directed the picture the stamp of burton is clearly everywhere in the film with bold colors imaginative character design and it simple yet compelling story the direction of harry selick who also directed james and the giant peach is strong offering intimate views of the strange collection of characters also memorable are the songs in the film written by former oingo boingo lead singer danny elfman the next john williams of film composing the nightmare before christmas is intended for both the kid and adult in everyone it not just child play for the holidays it movie about how to be truly happy in tough world saying that all you need to do is just be exactly who you are without compromise what better message is there for christmas
it an interesting premise our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real in truth our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains what we see what we do everything around us is nothing more than computer generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through vastly powerful artificial intelligence our bodies severely atrophied are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for dominating order of machines which control the planet the sci fi realm has been waiting little while for something new to come along the matrix isn it the idea of war between man and sentient computer network sham world the ability to plug one brain into computer has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator dark city and few star trek episodes both classic and next generation what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing film that is both entertaining as well as thought provoking keanu reeves plays computer whiz nicknamed neo who is plucked out of the artificial world known as the matrix by group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines the group leader morpheus laurence fishburne has chosen neo because he believes neo is the one who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence >from the beginning of the film we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out this in lesser movie would be annoying but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun what is reality what is sham the film turns our very perception of life on its side more than once we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality or live life of relative bliss oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings as viewers this is intriguing enough so imagine what it would be like for neo and who to better play bewildered person than keanu reeves reeves whom ve never really cared for as an actor is competent in roles which require lot of straightforwardness and little subtlety he was good in speed for example but laughably poor in walk in the clouds neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely so much of my expectation was happily for naught in couple of places the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature and this is heavy credit to writers directors andy and larry wachowski mean since bill and ted excellent adventure what movie could you say really utilized keanu reeves more interesting than reeves is fishburne who morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions and convincingly so very surprising for sci fi movie fishburne also maintains certain demeanor about himself throughout as if he always knows what to expect this helps to further the aura of his character proficiency and extensive knowledge hugo weaving as agent smith one of the artificial intelligence anti intruder programs is also good playing his deadpan no nonsense kick ass role which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time unfortunately when weaving speaks for more than few sentences in row the nature of his character speech pattern becomes little more laughable than impressive carrie anne moss plays trinity morpheus number one assistant who becomes somewhat of love interest for neo although her character is somewhat inconsistent moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn in the picture there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects many methods of imagery are employed from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics of special note is the use of the freeze and turn effect where the entire scene is frozen turned then continued from new angle this is accomplished by using large number of still cameras employed in semi circle with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends the motion cameras film the action and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once place each still image in film sequence and you get nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second pretty slick the matrix drips with style from the clothing to the music to the action we re watching an exaggerated version of what we re used to much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film there lot of kung fu there lot of gunplay when character is letting go with an automatic weapon much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion there also the element of the japanese action cartoon called anime by aficionados especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects combined it really like no live action film have ever seen the film is not without its faults some of the scenes and ideas are borrowed little too liberally from other films and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing some of the lines are also pretty bad in one instance supporting character incorrectly delivers famous saying and it wasn meant to be joke however these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci fi film that for once does more than merely entertain
when quentin tarantino made pulp fiction he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s he was also making what believe to be the most influential movie of all time but before you send me hate mail for not giving that title to citizen kane hear me out much like citizen kane pulp fiction has changed movie making forever but think the latter has had tad more impact pulp fiction has actually ushered in new era of film making it has altered the way films will be viewed fiction has spawned so many imitations ve lost count sure some have been excellent bound and the usual suspects spring immediately to mind but any serious movie goer recognizes pulp fiction as the original neo noir of the 90s in this review hope to change all the people minds who have criticized it for it excessive profanity and violence which by the way isn really that graphic the most brilliant aspect of tarantino masterpiece is the screenplay it is filled with so much classic dialogue the quarter pounder with cheese speech will go down in history it should be required reading for any film student if it isn already the story told in unorthodox non linear format centers around three main episodes all of which eventually intertwine the first titled vincent vega and marcellus wallace wife deals with very loaded john travolta forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot up sequence taking mia wallace star making performance by uma thurman his bosses wife out on date to cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim they talk for while with the occasional uncomfortable silence mostly about guy called tony rocky horror after giving marcellus new bride foot massage he was thrown off building and into greenhouse giving him speech impediment they also partake in cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic you never can tell won reveal the rest of the story but ll definitely say that it turns out to be real bummer of night despite the cool trophy they win the second story the least of the three but still four stars stars bruce willis proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the die hard flicks as boxer butch coolidge previously in the film like said it told in non linear form he had made deal with marcellus wallace that he would take fall in match as it turns out he not only doesn take the fall but he ends up actually killing his opponent he takes cab to his half witted girlfriend apartment and to make long story short ends up going back to his own place to retrieve altin watch sort of family heirloom explained by christopher walken in hilarious flash back sequence on his way home he bumps into literally marcellus the two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers which results in the infamous gimp scene which is very reminicent of the squeal like pig scene from deliverance the last and best in my opinion of the episodes features john travolta again and samuel jackson in the best performance of any supporting actor ever as two slightly off kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of bloody car they seek help with friend of jackson played by the man himself desperately in need of stress ball they end up calling cleaner of sorts played by the god among men harvey keitel to help them out in the end the story brilliantly loops around itself actually ending where it began if you haven already seen the film or even if you have for that matter suggest you invest your money in copy of the letterbox collectors edition it features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen earlier today bought this version and watched it few hours ago what the pan and scan did to this movie is inexcusable that version cut out like half the movie what have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing for instance when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses this might help explain the divine intervention that takes place just theory one of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies psycho kiss me deadly deliverance etc but why shouldn he it not like he out right and blatantly stole give the guy break in case you haven already noticed believe pulp fiction is supremely excellent film and one of the best of all time up there with such greats as casablanca and the godfather trust me you will not see better film come out of the 90s and besides it one hell of ride note if anyone knows how could get bad motherfucker wallet please mail me any help would be greatly appreciated
the postman delivers but not first class the postman film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman [warning my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons post apocalypse stories hope in desperate situation grassroots uprisings and kevin costner even worse thought that waterworld was watchable read the following with those particular grains of salt it the year 2013 and things have fallen apart due to world war in the late nineties the resulting three year winter and devastating plague life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms although this is the future it looks like western as the film opens kevin costner his character name is never revealed is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging costner is an outsider in land of outsiders running into even worse luck he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem will patton the rag tag retro futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the clan after brutal boot camp he and you can see this coming mile away escapes taking shelter in wrecked postal truck he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has use for either once he reaches oregon land of beautiful women bright youngsters and rock and roll he pretends to be representative from the restored congress of the united states of america this scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants food and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby olivia williams who wants him to father child because her husband is sterile shortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman as costner is referred to for the rest of the film become reluctant item although the postman knows he running fraud the concept of renewed communications sets the kids imagination afire especially ford lincoln mercury larenz tate his second in command and they form new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists tyranny the postman has become symbol for hope in rube goldberg manner although the movie appeals to my sensibilities there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted it derivitive of costner own waterworld and clint eastwood westerns there little here that we haven seen dozens of times before the film is often down right corny scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs letter from the hands of bright eyed child is embarrassing in its slow motion banality the film final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor despite the film excessive three hour length several things are never explained what was the war about how did civilization change so rapidly everyone has horses where did all they come from the law of eights that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film but where are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn made their way west to help or conquer there is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn appear to make sense the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments but beyond that there are some oddities the evil army is called holnists which sounds coincidentally like the new age holism but why is it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 just one year after many ancient prophesies including the ending of the mayan calendar predict new world for mankind why is the general named bethlehem there seems to be some reason for that but what sometimes the movie feels like joke an army of postal workers armed with guns considering the headlines of recent years it takes tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys it even more difficult to accept those re powering the federal government as the heroes given the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government it asking lot for the audience to get behind the film nationalism even with its numerous flaws the movie all comes together if only for those who have the same weaknesses that have it doubtful that the postman is going to find much of an audience but few of us are going to have good time besides we re all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and would like to announce that the michael redman arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is to the best of his knowledge not him perhaps this similarly named person should have used kevin costner postal service
studio expectations must not have been high for great expectations the film release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999 it actually smart move because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isn quite oscar fodder it is strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year great expectations also demonstrates how to modernize classic story right especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann william shakespeare romeo juliet great expectations opens somewhere in 1970s florida the original story is set in 19th century england as eight year old finn jeremy james kissner meets trio of people who will have profound effect on his life in the future there icy 11 year old estella raquel beaudene pseudo playmate of finn ms dinsmoor anne bancroft estella auntie who quite off kilter over past romance that never took off and mysterious prisoner robert de niro whom finn saves the life of finn who lives with his sister affable boyfriend lone star chris cooper fancies himself an aspiring artist and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms dinsmoor lipstick eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion flash forward into the 90s after brief stop in the 80s and finn now played by ethan hawke despondent over strange hot and cold relationship with the elusive estella gwyneth paltrow receives quite bit of money from an unknown benefactor it enough cash to send him to new york to focus on career in art there finn seems to gain everything he could ever want wealth prestige and high place in the glamorous art world when estella resurfaces albeit with an aloof fianc hank azaria finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction but she not the only ghost from finn past that going to be paying him visit comparisons with the afore mentioned romeo juliet seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into current setting great expectations is much better venture though because it treats its source with even handed respect where romeo was never quite sure whether to be spoof homage or both the movie is visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki sexy cinematography notably he captures revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with luscious erotic charge that steamier than the film surprisingly muted love scenes the eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on screen action beautifully especially new songs by tori amos mono and duncan sheik acting credits are first rate often hiding the screenplay occasional slip ups hawke is sincere and solid as leading man something we also learned from gattaca and his finn is quite likeable guy paltrow estella on the other hand is rather underdeveloped while the actress is at her icily seductive best we re not told very much about her character and as result it often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond physical level but oh what physical level sometimes we root for finn although we don quite understand why she fueling his fire robert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft macabre throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous alfonso cuaron visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie climax another problem is predictability you can guess your way through the plot even if you aren familiar with the story despite its script flaws though great expectations is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy and frankly it nice to see film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality perhaps that renovated release date awfully close to valentine day will end up helping great expectations seemingly average box office chances after all
getting it right is far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from summer movie about male virginity the film was directed by randal kleiser who brought us such bubble gum classics as grease and the mavi lagoon but thanks to kleiser surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script getting it right is pleasantly quiet moving and memorable film one geared strictly toward sophisticated adult audience getting it right stars jesse birdsall emily lloyd boyfriend in wish you were here as gavin painfully shy 31 year old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who gasp is still virgin gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon but expose him to single 30 year old beauty and he mess much to gavin surprise the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan lynn redgrave rich married and lonely 45 year old getting it right is the simple story of gavin awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right that is to find the right woman to fulfill his life getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in depth character development gavin self conscious voice over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self confident maturity birdsall superb understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film he seems convincing and authentic throughout the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin life despite her limited screen time redgrave makes quite splash in the movie as gavin middle aged seducer for supporting character joan is unusually and impressively complex thanks in large part to redgrave magnificent performance gavin is also pursued or perhaps plagued by minnie the totally neurotic daughter of rich aristocrat after minnie and gavin meet at party she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role and sir john gielgud with his tongue in his cheek embodies the height of arrogance as her father gavin eventual love interest is jenny the adorable twenty year old single mother who assists him at the beauty salon london stage actress jane horrocks fine performance yields touchingly sweet character peter cook the great british satirist appears briefly in the film as gavin uptight employer the scenes of gavin home life with his parents are also treat gavin over protective mother pat heywood whom even woody allen would find overbearing almost steals the movie her life seems limited to just two activities treating gavin like 10 year old and preparing exotic but inedible meals such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce gavin and his father attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing getting it right for the most part is very well crafted except for two minor shortcomings first the movie is about 15 minutes too long and consequently it loses momentum at times second the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin best friend harry and his unfaithful lover winthrop overall however getting it right is quite memorable for its humor depth sophistication and outstanding acting director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard adapting her own highly acclaimed novel deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth maturation and self discovery
bruce willis and sixth sense director night shyamalan re team to tell the story of david dunne willis stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child on return trip from new york where he was trying to get job dunne is in horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of to make things even stranger dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed comic book art dealer named elijah price samuel jackson who was born with degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was child dunne doesn believe him at first but price assists him in discovering his powers and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is writer director night shyamalan had tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years for shyamalan the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash though the answer to that question is not very easy one either as far as pacing goes the sixth sense seemed almost interminable it wasn until the surprise ending was revealed that realized the film was actually intentionally and perfectly paced in order to give the audience ample time to re connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached for unbreakable shyamalan gave the film much more satisfying pace which in many ways blows away the film that had come before the story moves along at steady pace and shyamalan direction is excellent with the camera almost constantly moving there are tons of great shots in the film not least of which is conversation that opens the film between willis character and another train passenger the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak also very impressive is the film score by james newton howard who also scored shyamalan sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes as well as this year dinosaur several of the scenes are driven by very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film one of the best examples of this is scene in which dunne goes into train station to exercise his powers the music in combination with the stellar visuals really go long way towards making this an incredible movie if there was any one soundtrack would make must purchase this year this one would be it the film also boasts some great performances including precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment willis turns in great performance as the sad sack dunne who just can seem to figure out why he been depressed for the last few years his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him but he eventually grows into his own under elijah tutelage jackson is one of the better actors of our time and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah though his hairstyle is absurd jackson seems to infuse such great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked robin wright penn role seems slightly underwritten but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again spencer treat clark as the dunne young son jeremy shows that shyamalan still has knack for picking young actors and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film out of all the characters jeremy is perhaps the most emotional and clark does great job with the role where the film does lose points though is during its surprise ending shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense but found myself saying that was it when unbreakable revealed its own ending it not that the ending is bad it just that the ending doesn quite have the emotional punch that the other film did plus it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels and won reveal the ending here but you ll understand what mean when you see it essentially what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable the only real problem is that the ending doesn quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor as long as it isn held to the standard that sixth sense set which it ultimately will be it should be remarkably well liked film one thing seems clear though shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film
harmless silly and fun comedy about dim witted wrestling fans gordie and sean david arquette and scott caan who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king oliver platt when king is screwed out of his title by corrupt promoter joe pantoliano gordie and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero and restore his glory my biggest fear about ready to rumble was dispatched early on as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed but not fake mind you the hook of the movie is that gordie and sean are just too stupid to realize that arquette and caan are suitably over the top with their performances which is exactly what movie like this requires and oliver platt one of my favorite actors is riot as the drunken washed up ex champion many have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record but for me it just added to the silly factor of the film thereby increasing my enjoyment of it one casting complaint however rose mcgowan as sexy dancer please if rose mcgowan is sexy then marilyn manson given the current state of the actual wcw if oliver platt were appearing as jimmy king right now on wcw programming he be the most popular guy they have on similar note the plot line of the wresting portions of the film are more entertaining than anything the wcw writers have been able to come up with in the last two years although one does have to ask why would any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler of company who is both unbeaten and extremely popular with the fans director brian robbins you ll remember him as eric from tv head of the class just knows how to make good dumb movies this movie fits in nicely with his previous efforts good burger and varsity blues and screenwriter steven brill the epic mighty ducks trilogy late last night manages to keep things both sophomoric and clever at the same time with almost all the jokes of the film getting laugh out of me the only exceptions to that were scene involving van full of singing nuns and any scene involving the old woman wrestling fan those moments made me cringe and or groan as an added bonus though the audience is treated to outtakes from the film as the final credits roll [pg 13]
oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with in perfect world civil action would be breath of fresh air it cynical about lawyers in way that grisham isn it romantic in the exact opposite way grisham book film isn and the capper it has no distinct ending and the law in hollywood films is that above all else you must have an ending even if it based on true story true story which hasn yet ended you must supply an ending false one but an ending nevertheless hell civil action is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together and that includes the firm the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as classic yet it also oddly and slightly unsatisfying weird this is in fact steve zallian film not just the work of hack and zallian is the director of the much admired search for bobby fischer didn see it and writer of none other than schindler list in short like this guy and am sucker for the way he tells his stories after all apart from the obvious it holocaust film and it spielberg film isn schindler list just damn brilliant film not so much holocaust film as it is wonderful character study civil action is the same way it narrative is split between being lawyer film and being character study and it here that the film seems to go bit wrong the main complaint of this film is that while yes it an engrossing lawyerly tale it has no real ending and that not necessarily the problem with the film it that it just kind of unsatisfying if this were great film it would feel complete and still end basically the same way but this film just seems to end and don want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on imagine if you will being one of those the film is about looking forward to this film and then discovered the truth has been through surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter just so the many won bitch about what is essentially genuine but the fact that it just ends is not in all actuality what is wrong with it it rather that zallian has chosen in the last half hour to adandon the traditional lawyer story and chose the other part of his story the one about the lawyer one jan schlictman john travolta who shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as heartless but brilliant lawyer brilliant because he manipulative and he always wins it wishes to make it all about jan in the end but the truth is his change although nicely done is not full we see him suffering from personal crisis and travolta does do pretty good job in depicting his change of heart but in the end we don fully believe it and think that the problem is when he has made his decision the film choses an odd angle to go at noble one but one that gives the film conclusion that of incompleteness in the opening of the film we see him doing his old schtick manipulating courts winning cases effortlessly and then discussing on heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases in short he full of bullshit and we know it in the film he takes case that is hardly desired town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river point one it not of the usual criteria jan points out wickedly that dead or wounded children aren nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success point two it has been through several lawyers after turning them down jan changes his mind muddled scene he stops his car on bridge looks out is he feeling sense of overachievement and he and his team of lawyers tony shalhoub zeljko ivanek and accountant william macy head out to the town to do battle with the town company they spend millions of dollars examining the land test the water what have you this is where stephen fry possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in wilde pops up thanklessly and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children and then unsuccessfully the workers at the plant they also find themselves clashing with brilliant lawyer for the company the eccentric jerome facher played by robert duvall more on him later on as we progress we get so involved in the way the story is being told which is engulfing everything around it including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople one of the best is bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland who lost her child who begins to have personal crisis things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half as they are up against impossible odds the judge john lithgow is not only strickler but pal of facher the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify no concrete evidence is being found depsite the money spent to find it and they are quickly running out of money as macy mortgages everything he can including their homes and their office he slowly loses his sanity his meatiest role since oh fargo and we the audience begin to feel real loss of hope for our protagonist in fact the last half hour is such change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par owen gleiberman especially criticized the film for not being overly dramatic suppose like grisham novel this wouldn be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is instead of having change of heart and automatically being perceived as good he seen as being still full of bullshit because he doesn take stock in the cares of his partners and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out the final half tries to redeem this as must have been the point of making this in zallian mind but what follows is series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him and thusly receiving two speeding tickets we still feel that the big change in his life is that he not rich and esteemed anymore the film final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case it still going on you know but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has we need to feel like the character has really made big change in his life and that the story is how story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such whopping change in his personal life it only feels like half of that maybe even less and it not travolta who does great job here though never to be truly memorable performance of his but rather zallian whose final chapter needs rewrite up to then though it an engrossing drama one of the best of the year in fact and one of the best lawyer films period the reason is because it recognizes that court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted but rather it about the lawyers the knights who battle eachother we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town but the reason it can be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find and duvall facher is such brilliant character and he does such magnificent job at portraying that man that it almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is facher is seen as an elderly man goofy eccentric carrying broken brown bag with stickers on it eating lunches out of paper bags and making point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio and scold anyone who interupts him but look deeper and you see master at work his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him and it difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way that why liked this film it hard to put pointer on you can never see exactly where this film will land and even when the credits roll you still aren sure what to make of it call it the zallian effect same thing happened with schindler list not that comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman each film is so greatly crafted that you can help but get involved in its broad storytelling interesting characters and most peculiarly the wit that comes along with it if only it felt totally complete like say schindler list though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two it might have been one of the best films of the year and along with that full breath of fresh air

in the opening shot of midnight cowboy we see close up of blank movie screen at drive in we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses hooves without an image projected onto the screen the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind eye even without having seen cowboys and indians movie somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema but do cowboys really exist or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper exploring this theme director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as metaphor for the american dream an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america hallmark of its experience or an urban legend midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream like image of the cowboy is merely myth as joe buck migrates from place to place he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create life for himself only further degeneration during the opening credits joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne the alamo as joe is on the bus listening to radio talk show lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper but he dead troubled expression comes across joe face as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone having adopted the image of cowboy since youth joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody joe persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream he romanticizes about making it in the big city but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance by the end of midnight cowboy joe buck loses everything and gains nothing just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on blank screen we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success but how realistic are these ideals joe had raped and been raped in texas the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york but he does not know that his aspirations to be cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation the ability to pack up one belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny we understand that joe adopts the fa ade of cowboy symbol of virility and gallantry as an attempt to neutralize his shame he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe encounter with the gay student joe buck spills ketchup on himself standing up we see the ketchup has made kirmizi stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals signifying emasculation beyond the symbol of castration the scene may also connote the bleeding of virgin first sexual encounter reference to joe first homosexual liaison the fact that the idea of bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe emasculation it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients but effortlessly attracts men joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff there are two predominant images of new york the first is that new york is the rich cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty the other new york is travis bickle new york seedy corruptive hell on earth joe envisions new york as the former but is presented with the latter mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men joe thinks he is performing great service for new york but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions the people steal joe money the landlord confiscates his luggage and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity what has become of joe american dream schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party joe gets invited to shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to dizzying array of food drugs and sex at the party all of joe and ratzo desires are made flesh joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami contrasting joe daily struggles shots of warhol crew display wanton indulgence there is an irreverence in the partygoers attitude we see shot of woman kowtowing to nothing in particular orgies breaking out in the periphery and drugs passed around like party favors the party makes mockery of joe ideals joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe toils the american dream schlesinger suggests is merely proletarian fantasy for those who are content no longer dream but become indolent as joe heads to miami all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished for joe nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately he surrenders the identity tossing his boots into the garbage he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus more introspective taking only few glances outside the window instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus window with joe hardly taking notice the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before the world seems smaller to joe now the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream no longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo he resolves to return to normal job and resign to basic means midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel few indians you can set up ranch out west and raise beautiful family then there is the jay gatsby dream that man of humble stock with perseverance can make fortune in the big city joe attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york during his search for an intangible paradise joe ends up raping girl and killing man an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream joe buck progressive moral atrophy is warning against the pursuit of illusory icons

errol morris critically acclaimed director of the 1997 documentary fast cheap and out of control vaults to new heights with mr death this film an examination of the life and work of controversial execution equipment designer and revisionist historian fred leuchter jr is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise stunning even the more jaded minds among us don let the film cheesy dissuade you following this sideshow of horror lab special effects we are plunged quickly into non stop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchter life and mind morris follows the trail of leuchter madness with appalling lucidity revealing in surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with this leuchter guy is seriously messed up virtually raised within the american penal system by father who worked within prison walls leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into his profession designing and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries in spite of his lack of credentials after moderately successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and gallows leuchter came to the attention of neo nazi and revisionist historian ernst zundel who was facing criminal charges in germany for publishing his `theory that the holocaust never happened morris interviews are surprisingly congenial drawing the subjects into carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves zundel speaks to the camera as though it were his mensch leuchter seems completely at ease sometimes jovial part of this effect may be due to morris new interviewing machine called the interrotron which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject and the interviewer this was the first time morris had used the device and the results are startling combine the irony of these interviews with leuchter reenactments and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz and birkenau not to mention haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant and you ve got one compelling and disturbing documentary while this film isn for the feeble minded or weak hearted it is valuable addition to the cultural landscape aside from few dragging minutes toward the end of the piece morris has given us fresh look at dismal subject and for one feel bettered by the experience
review ghost dog the way of the samurai 1999 cast forest whitaker henry silva cliff gorman john tormey gene riffini victor argo tricia vessey isaach de bankole camille winbush director jim jarmusch writer jim jarmusch rating good shot stars languid yet pointed and focused ghost dog the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek ultra cool cinematic image of the hitman juxtaposing the samurai honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american italian mafia it ceaselessly chips away with sculptor precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber dinosaur like to function in the modern era director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit using palate of bleached colors jarmusch lugubriously maintains tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film he doesn cater to audience expectations of hyper colorized stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies the action is presented in flat brutal codas bullets have permanence death has consequences the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty it is an anti movie of sorts there are few photogenic empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with this isn film that lovingly holds your hand there are dark contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder just so asserting itself for all to see the fulcrum for the movie thematic balancing act is ghost dog mafia hitman twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer ghost dog is hilarious contradiction in terms unlike the sleek muscular killing machines one is accustomed to we are given an inner city siyah man who is overweight and slovenly replete with chapped dirty hands and rumpled clothing he wears hooded sweatshirt which he often pulls over his head giving him monk like appearance there are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal he uses old worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical efficient and pleasureless fashion ghost dog is disciple of the old ways of the samurai distilling the essence of his life through the filter of book which he reads daily hagakure the way of the samurai life consists of simple pleasures for him ice cream warm rooftop naps and good books ghost dog lives as it were by the basic tenet expressed by his book one should start each day considering oneself as dead living atop an abandoned building surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons ghost dog exists in netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends he craves nothing more as he puts it late in the film ve seen all want to see he exists in spiritual world of the mind gaining moral sustenance from his readings ghost dog wasn always as he is presented in several roshomon like flashbacks it shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist beyaz males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of good samaritan that samaritan being foot soldier in an aging crime family ghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man louie tormey as repayment after years of loyal service ghost dog is sent by louie to kill handsome frank made man within louie organization who has run away with the crime boss daughter louise vessey ghost dog wordlessly executes his task witnessed by louise whom he spares as she sits watching betty boop cartoon clutching copy of the book roshomon in bit of synchronicity louise loans the book to ghost dog upset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family the mob bosses in turn put out hit on ghost dog in perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade the rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict the theme of old cartoons flares up time and again each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog world each time character is shown watching cartoon it from the same era betty boop felix the cat etc reflection of days gone by near the end louise is watching cartoon that departure from the previously shown ones it bit of audacity on jarmusch part that is nicely effective despite it surrealistic nature as ghost dog floats through his world his life is touched by two people one is sage little girl winbush who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading she comes to symbolize melding of the old ways and new sensibilities just as louise ultimately does by film end the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is testament to his skill as writer the other person in ghost dog world is an ice cream de bankole vendor who only speaks french yet intuitively shares rapport with ghost dog the vendor is the literal stranger in strange land jarmusch through rapper composer rza underscores his film with rap and reggae music which at first blush seems dichotomous but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie ghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars which in and of itself presents another paradox about ghost dog sense of honor the head mafioso is played by henry silva with stone faced resignation of all the cartoonish mobsters he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world gorman plays sonny lieutenant who respects the old ways yet has quirky affinity for rap music love comically shown in several impromptu displays ruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia he is husk of man assisted by two hearing aids who barks out advice without truly hearing what he or others are saying whitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor use his face ghost dog is reticent to speak often going for long periods without doing so the fact that whitaker can convey such wide range of emotion through gesture or look is remarkable talent although the film has deliberate pace some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down truly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob he reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world carried on the shoulders of remarkable performance by whitaker ghost dog rises beyond being characterization or icon into figure that garners sympathy if not bit of pity
ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan you remember he was the title character in that 70 sitcom welcome back kotter always trying to help out the sweathogs frequently trying to dodge mr woodman ever wary of his wife tuna casserole so you ask where is he now mr kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high stakes poker that right not sure if it his main source of income but from what ve heard the guy occasionally comes away with $20 000 at time and there you were thinking was going to tell you he was doing off broadway theater you silly goose well gabe kaplan isn in the movie rounders nor is the film about the actor come gambler life but rounders is about poker and gabe plays poker and thought that was kind of neat connection sorry about the segue or lack thereof matt damon plays mike mcdermott law student who also has singular talent for the game of poker he been playing for while and more than being proficient he has caught the bug he goes to all the underground games in new york city knows the regulars and knows how to win in the beginning of the film he built up nice thirty grand nest egg which he takes to the speakeasy type gaming parlor where the big boys play mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb john malkovich an oreo munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia mike has the potential to take large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker but instead he loses it all in single hand months later he paying his way through law school by driving delivery truck when mike best friend and poker buddy worm edward norton finishes his jail term for hustling some students he wants to pick up right were they left off working as team to part others with their betting cash although mike has stopped playing cards as promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student jo gretchen mol worm connives mike into playing once more and mike bitten again by the bug slides down that slippery slope risking his relationship education and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life to make film about gambling filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters this is because few moviegoers will care whole lot about some guy in leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at folding card table with stogie in his mouth rounders however seems to go more for the latter than the former the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren very glamorous at all there basement lodge with elk heads on the wall goulash joint these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it we re given nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations and good actors to play them matt damon is very natural as mike who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school and answering what may be his true calling playing professional poker ed norton worm is truly worm always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they re worth john turturro who amazes me with his acting range tones it down in this film by playing joey knish virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments he both friend and mentor to mike and turturro low key performance is totally convincing just as john malkovich heavily accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike law professors abe petrovsky while landau slips well into the role his character spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one self facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward predictable ending perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line up of acting talent however is gretchen mol who just didn seem to have much presence on screen she genuine peach to look at kind of cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel and wouldn be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world but her delivered lines seemed very flat and found myself looking for matt damon reactions instead good thing about rounders is that it doesn get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can find time for humor the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going such as sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next in widely different locales one game in cigar club had me in stitches love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper says one of the players clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys with all the poker being played rounders had the potential to be very confusing you might think you know lot about poker but think again luckily we re given narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what going on the narrations are more informative than intrusive and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do it nice that as the characters develop so does our comprehension of their world as film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker rounders delivers in spades wait as film about the culture of cards rounders is an ace hang on packed with great acting and great characters rounders is full house okay guess that enough oh by the way if you ever want to get into game with ol gabe kaplan be sure to bring note from epstein mother
if you had chance to create genetically perfect child would you do it gattaca is film which presents future where society has answered yes to this question but then ponders if this was actually the right decision gattaca came out only couple months following the first genetically engineered creature the lovable dolly the sheep and with this in mind the film only becomes more frightening the way the realm of genetics is heading it may only take couple decades until the future gattaca presents becomes true contrary to the misleading trailers gattaca is not sci fi thriller in the way that there lots of murder hitchcockian suspense and chase scenes this is quiet sad film about intelligent theories in fact the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley the latter who novel brave new world featured genetically engineered children it film that may likely become cult hit to people who are frightened by promise of shallow utopia which is exactly what gattaca presents and the main reason dug it so much the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ethan hawke man with high hopes but 90% chance of heart problems and prospected life span of around 30 years as child he was put down because of the threats of genetics while his younger genetically perfect brother anton loren dean was promised whatever his heart desired vincent yearns to be an astronaut but when he gets job at giant space company it as janitor ernest borgnine plays his boss but one day he finds out that it probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of business deal brought out by siyah market geneticist or something german wings tony shalhoub who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in 97 men in siyah life less ordinary who client is genetically perfect man jerome morrow jude law who has unfortunately been crippled fortunately though there no record of the accident and he willing to give someone else his life since vincent looks bit like him after couple alterations some minor some really major he has donned the life of jerome and is doing his job there he meets genetically imperfect woman irene uma thurman who genetically perfect in real life anyway hee hee and the two begin kind of relationship albeit very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great man stats are however murder of high level worker at his office is killed and one of vincent jerome eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by semi wily inspector hugo alan arkin and none other than vincent long lost brother anton who hasn seen him since they were teenagers we know vincent jerome didn do it but with his older picture being posted everywhere not only vincent jerome in trouble but also the real jerome who as much in it as he is however there isn many big suspense set pieces which is actually blessing because if they were tossed in the film would lose it message and descend into just being sci fi thriller la william gibson the suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping hair or dead skin while there are several scenes which are pretty frightening there are no big distractions from the point of the film much to the dismay of commercial audiences what is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created irene has no real spunk in her life and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of sunrise rather than genetically perfect people and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality bitter man claiming that his accident was really no accident what jerome has done is fool the system in giving man who yearns for better things chance at that and the ending is shocking as it definite work of dystopian propaganda but doesn have the down ending of other works of this kind the production design of this film is probably the best ve seen this year it stunning very pleasing to the eye but still very cold since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement the world has cooled into state of inhumanity and the sets echo sense of shallow misery and the sequence of all the high level workers doing their jobs has kind of gilliam esque feel to it showing the nightmare of slipping into routine zombie like life the ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy the acting from everyone is great with thurman giving wonderfully cold performance and hawke creating character who has been beaten down by the system but has found new sense of optimism by bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway interesting pointless fact uma and ethan started dating after this film and currently she is pregnant with his child but the best performance belongs to jude law who steals every scene he in and creates character filled with the pessimism over having such horrible burden placed on his burden think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in child but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something not sure of gattaca warns us not to go any farther chiefly because we ll create world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are and when see possible future featuring 12 fingered piano player well folks that just creeps me out
vampire lore and legend has always been popular fantasy element substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents and unlike any of the more outlandish myths the vampire holds some real world probability one study claims 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide and places 50 in los angeles but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys john carpenter would like to remind us that they are and always have been truly frightening element of the thriller genre and remind us he does in his latest film vampires there was some question as halloween weekend approached of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema immensely successful blade released in august the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue and don even agree on some basic points of the slaying method for instance blade main weapons are silver and garlic whereas main character jack crow technique is wooden stake to the heart blade also gives more of face to the vampire civilization while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate both have their advantages and here carpenter style lends itself to darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered when it all said and done though the vampires still kill and die with bloody flourish the level for gore is indeed set to maximum this time our hero is vatican sponsored slayer jack crow james woods he cynical battle worn veteran and the best of his bunch he and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest and after exterminating nest one night they run up against super vampire termed master named valek thomas ian griffith valek kills all of jack team except for his partner tony montoya daniel baldwin and as the two regroup they learn that valek is the original vampire now over six hundred years old apparently valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime so with the aid of priest named adam tim guinee and bitten hooker sheryl lee as bait they track valek down for the final confrontation the script for vampires written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year crow in particular is fun source of one liners and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism baldwin lee and guinee are all fine supports adding to the character pool but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffith bad guy griffith intense expression is perfect for the role and the only downside is that he got to talk sometime luckily he got few lines and manages to pull off rather thrilling performance all said fans will surely be impressed by this picture and those who found apt pupil bit limp will be excited by this one certainly worthwhile visit to the theaters
james cmaeron breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok for those of you who do not know the plot in 2029 machines have engineered nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race human survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed however some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor to stop connor the machines send terminator arnold schwarzenegger back to 1984 to murder connor mother sara linda hamilton and thus prevent connor from ever being born in response the humans send protector kyle reese played by michael biehn images of machines and of humans reliance on machines dominate the film even though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 humans continue to use the machines in the climax of star wars luke relies on the force alone his own spiritual power to destroy the death star in the terminator however sara must use another machine giant hydraulic press to vanquish her enemy cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable and he not happy about it unabated technological growth brings about the terminator other obsession the apocalypse we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la children watch the flames in burning television when the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him even though the future is not set there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence all sara can do is await it cameron doesn wimp out like he does in terminator the end of the world is the human race own fault too after all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place back in 1984 when the cold war was still in full effect the film must have been seen as very apt metaphor for nuclear war another obsession of cameron these days one can read criticism of machine like behavior in humans true humanizing touches are put into paul winfield and lance henriksen detective characters but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected cameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la from technical standpoint the terminator is very well done arnold schwarzenegger is perfect antagonist unstoppable merciless obdurate we are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger later works eg commando but fear him cameron and hurd script basically depicts one hour and forty five minute chase taking few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot while we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese intentions cameron directs the film at rapid kinetic pace either the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving usually both occurs the violence is not particularly graphic temple of doom heart pull scene outgrosses the terminator but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective for low budget film the terminator special effects and art direction especially in 2029 la are remarkably well done special mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton it is some of the best stop motion have ever seen one thing that doesn hold up after all the years however is linda hamilton hairdo
in december of 1996 little movie called scream was released became box office smash and resurrected films targeted at teens first it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad both scream movies know what you did last summer urban legend etc but just recently the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre la 80s john hughes starting with last june can hardly wait it may be the first week of april in 1999 but so far this year we have been given movie aimed at the 25 and under market almost every single week varsity blues jawbreaker cruel intentions simply irresistible the rage carrie and the mod squad coming april are two more of this type never been kissed and go and on april 23 we ve got the teen satire election and the teen horror comedy idle hands jeesh out of all of these moves however the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation 10 things hate about you is this past january mediocre ho hum she all that although similar in plotting ok darn near identical 10 things hate about you modern day version of shakespeare the taming of the shrew she all that got its inspiration from pygmalion is an infinitely superior film in every department from the smart direction by first time feature director gil junger to the charming and well written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast who give the best group of performances in teen comedy since 1985 the breakfast club and to top it all off in the inevitable climax set at the prom at least we didn have to once again suffer through goofy inappropriate dance sequence who could forget or want to remember for that matter this ludicrous development in she all that the day wide eyed shy new student cameron james joseph gordon levitt starts school at seattle based padua high he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore bianca stratford larisa oleynik although he doesn know french he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father larry miller won allow her to date until her bitter unconventional older sister kat julia stiles senior decides to kat of course has sworn off the likes of boys but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona heath ledger complicating matters cameron dorky friend michael david krumholtz decides to use wealthy jock joey andrew keegan who also has his sights set on bianca as pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey as you can see 10 things hate about you includes huge number of characters some of which haven even mentioned such as kat shakespeare obsessed friend mandella susan may pratt and bianca materialistic comrade chastity gabrielle union at short but well used running time of 98 minutes all of the characters are perfectly handled satisfyingly developed and for the most part are not treated as caricatures another flaw of she all that where the bad guys and gals ran around constantly saying you re vapor since could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained aside from good screenplay it the performances that can make or break movie and director junger has really hit the jackpot aside from joseph gordon levitt 3rd rock from the sun who gives his strongest performance to date here none of the actors are that well known but it is this aspect that brings particular freshness to the proceedings as the main character of kat julia stiles last seen in the miniseries the 60s is marvelous and always believable and certainly has bright future ahead of her even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard edged it was easy to identify with kat way of thinking she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath and completely admired her individuality no one think could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does heath ledger as the infamous bad boy of the town injects much life into patrick and has lot of chemistry with stiles one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith is able to turn bianca into person with multi dimensions even though she is accurately self centered at the on set in one truthful scene cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes she has one off beat element of the film and source of some hearty laughs is the way that the school staff act which is strikingly unformal allison janney as the guidance counselor ms perky who is writing trashy harlequin romance novel is comic dynamite as is daryl chill mitchell as the english teacher who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and at one point sends kat to the office because for once she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good although there are few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning most of it actually works especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters in one very funny scene chastity asks know people can be overwhelmed and they can be underwhelmed but can people just be whelmed at another point bianca and kat father stand out larry miller who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion before she leaves she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it like to be pregnant 10 things hate about you once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the 90s it also helps that the movie has perfectly assembled soundtrack mixing indie rock with new wave 80s songs and with thank goodness no rap by the film end it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together and was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca kat and her father and flawlessly acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class this is where the title comes from luckily doubt would be able to find ten things hate about 10 things hate about you but the positive aspects of the film far out number ten

the fighting sullivans contains major plot development in the last ten minutes that every movie guide has seen fit to give away there was no dramatic tension for me while watching the film as knew exactly what was going to happen and that the worst thing that can happen before viewing movie because of this will tread lightly so don ruin it for anyone reading this review and it would be very advisable to avoid all other material regarding this film until after you have seen it the fighting sullivans revolves around family that consists of mother father sister and five brothers the brothers are very close despite the occasional disagreement they are inseperable and never stray from one another their friendship and loyalty is the foundation of this picture the first half of the movie follows the brothers as young children and their various adventures when four of them get into fight with some local boys the youngest sullivan who is inside church at the time comes running out to assist but not before properly exiting the chapel if being awfully vague about details it because what have told you is essentially the first hour and half all can say is go watch this film because it is fine portrait of family that sticks together through the good and the bad and after you see the movie you will understand why this review has been written the way it has
charlie sheen stars as zane radio astronomer who listens for sounds from other lifeforms when he finally gets one his boss destroys the tape and fires him naturally zane is not ready to give up and he comes up with an ingenious way to do this himself he is aided by young neighborhood kid and they discover that the sound is coming from mexico so zane goes down there to investigate and runs into lady studying why the temperature of the earth has dangerously risen so suddenly zane is having marital problems at the time and an offer by her to spend the night with him is very tempting hearing charlie sheen deliver the line guess there is something to be said for celibacy is the funniest thing have ever heard in movie since matthew broderick discussed asexual reproduction in wargames this is just the setup and don want to give too much away because large part of the movies fun is the surprises charlie sheen who has had rocky career as of late is in top form here he is funny serious and determined to accomplish his goal sheen absolutely terrific performance is another big plus to this movie the story is ingeniously devised by twohy who also wrote and directed the equally clever cable movie grand tour disaster in time the films major flaw is very slow pace and not much happens in the earlygoings viewers may be growing restless for while but trust me if you stick around and keep your head in it you will have good time
capsule this is harrowing look at rarely dramatized chapter of wwii life in japanese prison camp to end all wars is moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone taste +3 to +4 more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way this may be holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law during world war ii of course the one goal was winning the war this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal when the japanese had captured prisoners they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output while the germans not known for their kindness in those days had 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27% the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story perhaps for fear of offending the japanese there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps certainly there was david lean the bridge on the river kwai there were some low budget british exploitation films and that was about it then there were tv series town like alice and tenko lest the experience be forgotten we have new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of firing squad it turns out to be grim joke one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves beating and torture are commonplace events men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable however unlike as in kwai the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital called by the prisoners the death house so goes war within war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in rail laying machine this is more than just battle of who will win the war but battle of ideologies the japanese believe that the individual is nothing that conformity to group norms is all that gives life meaning conformity is purpose before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story if the british with one american by the way and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story it is neither it is stirring and believable account of camp life the color has been distorted in the film to give washed out yellow this serves double purpose for cunningham it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat it also creates distancing effect the only touch that seems little out of place is the use of gaelic music this is powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience rate it on the to 10 scale and +3 on the to +4 scale
since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they re portraying it fitting to say that beloved come as real shock as film it confusing bizarre and as tough film to watch as any film ve seen all year and that not necessarily because of the three hour running time beloved is challenging to watch filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard and instead of straight forward hollywood ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed beloved comes off as cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened or rather toni morrison who wrote the novel upon which this is based beloved tells the story of an ex slave named sethe played by oprah winfrey who lives on large farm in the north with her children when the film opens her house is being terrorized by poltergeist which shakes things up wounds the dog and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family sethe is proud though and will not move her sons run away leaving only her and her daughter denver kimberly elise alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation couple years pass and the ghost remains and one day man named paul danny glover another ex slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on plantation together arrives asking for lodging he has been wandering around since he left the plantation and when he enters the house it turns kirmizi and becomes incredibly hot when he remarks about what he thinks is evil sethe replies it ain evil it just sad some more time passes and paul has become fervent member of the household and the ghost disappears but when they return one day from going out they discover young woman sitting in the house her name is beloved and as played by thandie newton she has almost zero motor skills she stumbles around half grabbing onto things and knocking them over and when she speaks she lets out low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk they let her into her house and she begins to turn things upside down beloved acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with ghost story most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic low lit room with the occasional flash to the past where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern day psychoanalysts sethe and paul have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation which includes such images as sethe being raped by the beyaz plantation hands with her nipples being licked prompting her to cry out to paul when reminiscing about it they took my milk worst of all was the month after her freedom when she was allowed to live like free person working with other blacks on farm and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back she runs to the barn near by carrying her four children and when her old owners burst in they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don leave them alone when she is inquired about this moment by paul in moment halfway through the film she says she doesn regret it she killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did and she has convinced herself she did the right thing of course beloved is really her daugher materialized though we aren flat out told that until later on in the film beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long thus beloved becomes sorta redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci fi classic solaris where cosmonaut discovers that his wife who commited suicide years before has materialized when he is orbiting over planet with complex brain system that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us it would control us completely beloved moves along freely without lot of explanation and for the most part this is extremely respectable the most interesting films are the ones that don explain everything for us leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense sethe is never fully explained as character but we understand all her actions since she being played by oprah winfrey it been well over decade since her last major performance in the color purple but judging from these two films ll bet she one of the best actresses working today if she was strictly an actress her talk show which suppose is great entity has prevented her from becoming noteworthy actress and that shame because she brings so much to this movie emotion sadness strength watching the strong sethe who so afraid of the past that she built rather strong protective coating around herself break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great she makes it real that not to say this is perfect film in fact wager to say that the fact that it confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is while oprah performance is powerful and easily sympathetic and dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february the structure of the film which doesn show what happened to her children till halfway through the film prevents us from really making cohesive connection to the film it doesn necessarily move as though they re memories of one particular character and by the end it has lost control over sethe and as she takes to bed we are unable to truly identify with her anymore but despite its tediousness perhaps that the point the distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable and it needs to get back with reality and for the most part this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be jonathan demme direction is bizarre in nature with the story and he creates the right mood making it tough film to sit through making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters there more to admire here like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization just like they would be in real life and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering but laced with touch of optimism the acting not only from winfrey is amazing and anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination everyone has been raving about thandie newton performance and how it should be rewarded however it must be noted that out of everyone she had the easiest part act like baby throw things stumble around chew food with your mouth open do think there another performance worthy of oscar conisderation but it kimberly elise as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane and has to carry the burden of her mother loss of reality towards the end it not that newton isn great she as annoying and wacky as the role demands it just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better despite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it and not that of writer morrison or director demme beloved has still not done well costing think around ninety million dollars it has since grossed about twenty two unfortunately this film is little too intense for viewers even for me and can stand almost anything recently viewed the hour long epic caligula the worst film have ever seen in my life and did it in mere sittings although respect beloved can say that really enjoyed it
usually movie is about something more than soiled rug but not the big lebowski the new offering from the creators of 1996 critical hit fargo is to say the least wildly entertaining originality has always been strong trait in the coen brother movies and the big lebowski is insanely original it begins oddly enough when jeff the dude lebowski jeff bridges is mistaken for millionaire jeff the big lebowski david huddleston who wife bunny tara reid owes money all over town two goons out to collect on bunny debt break into dude house they attempt to collect the money that bunny owes them and one of them urinates on his rug the next day dude explains his situation to his bowling team steve buscemi john goodman respectively he is advised to go to the big lebowski and get him to pay for the defiled rug he does this and shortly after gets tied up in kidnapping caper this is extremely funny movie with lots of belly laugh moments the coen brothers have assembled great cast that play off each other perfectly also several great supporting roles john turturro as child molesting bowler named jesus the coen script plays off perfectly and it all goes together to make it extremely entertaining doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of 1998 if you like anything else the coen brothers have done you will love this one if not they give this one try its little different

modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop broadway musical rather than victor hugo original tome adapted several times for the cinema this latest effort does superb job of translating the characters story and heart of the novel to the screen liam neeson stars as jean valjean as young man valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor for his crimes prison hardened him and on his release he seems doomed to life of crime and squalor however an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life and he vows to become better man however he runs up against one man who doesn believe in reform inspector javert geoffrey rush is an obsessive law abider he has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules even with benign intentions he once served as guard at the labor camp where valjean served and after valjean breaks his parole javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice two women also get caught up in the struggle fantine uma thurman is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society her daughter cosette mimi newman and later claire danes is her life yet she cannot afford to raise her instead cosette is sent to live with cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine and forces cosette into life little better than slave director bille august manages to create faithful adaptation of victor hugo novel which though omitting some of the political undertones remains true to the overall story and tone of the book hopefully you won as some clueless members of the audience did wonder where all the songs went the movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes the experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles neeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of man trying to do good but continually haunted by his past the supporting cast is also extraordinary the only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson playing the revolutionary marius the film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair but it is transitory and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film the novel les misirables is by any account an epic both in its scope and in its length while it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into two hour movie this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation it too is an epic and one worth seeing
what is freedom how does one determine who is free in 1839 those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now yet the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations that is in essence what steven spielberg gripping drama amistad is about through its various dramas spielberg presents case about group of africans who after being seized from their home were forced onto ship and sent to the united states aboard la amistad on their way there the slaves led by cinque djimon hounsou rebelled killing off part of the crew however the ship was still directed towards the united states where the africans were brought to trial under murder in the court various factions claim ownership of the slaves and therefore try to seize them away the united states government led by president martin van buren nigel hawthorne and secretary of state secretary forsyth david paymer try to ship the africans to spain where an 11 year old isabella ii anna paquin wants them back the two spaniards who own la amistad want the slaves for themselves the american ship that found the slaves also wants them in the midst of this are two abolitionists stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman who want the slaves to be free they enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey who tries to free them through various legal proceedings the case appears before the supreme court where it is argued by ex president john quincy adams anthony hopkins the film itself is visual wonder spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in dark somber mood when appropriate and visual setting when appropriate as well at times the film is very slow and very methodical however spielberg is not at his finest here because the courtroom scenes have tendency to lag the film is in essence courtroom drama one whose events are oversimplified the characterization is also weak displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin mcconaughey and especially morgan freeman abolitionist but spielberg finest work in the film the opening scene scene of cinque family and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america is altogether stunning it is this emotional force that carries the film mcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans hopkins is sensational as the old adams freeman is outstanding when used spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents and the rest of the cast is stellar the movie however belongs to hounsou his emotional intensity is brilliant spielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou and the film extraordinary power is simply captivating the film is flawed for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard but that doesn matter the story is gripping one and one of extreme importance kudos to spielberg for finding it finding the right men for the job and letting the audience listen to the words of cinque good job all around
your friends and neighbors is rather bizarre film about people who hop in and out of bed with each other written and directed by neil labute who first film in the company of men was simply marvelous disappoints bit here with this one the story involves two couples ben stiller catherine keener and aaron eckhart amy brenneman an artist assistant nastassja kinski and an egotistical women abuser jason patric the character names are not apparent and are not mentioned in the entire movie each of the characters has their own sexual style and they don seem to merge together well so the group experiments behind their respective partners back there are some hysterical scenes one involves jason patric aaron eckhart and ben stiller characters they are all in sauna talking about their best lay when jason patric character makes surprising confession the whole scene is hilarious and exceptionally well written and acted the enjoyed this movie although it seemed tad lengthy even though it only runs 99 min the film cast is exceptional with oscar caliber performances by catherine keener aaron eckhart and jason patric would not recommend this film to people who are offended by conversations that are very sexually explicit it did seem to offend people more than half of the people in the theater left during the film although your friends and neighbors doesn have the power of labute earlier film it still manages to be somewhat entertaining and funny while maintaining melancholy philosophy on human relationships
probably the most popular and praised film of all time turned out to be primitive and predictable costume drama with dose of social criticism everyone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time and the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron combining visual and sound effects he re creates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere liked very much the emotional and brutal contrast between the first and the third classes while their cabin is slowly filling up with water mother is telling her children fairytail and they lived happily ever after and then the ship goes down and the few survivors are left alone under the stars and the chilling air however the actual disaster is happening almost at the end of the movie while the first two hours are just beautiful sets and bad dialogues in the present day the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett bill paxton treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond lost during the sinking somewhere inside the ship lovett crew discover sketchbook of an artist long dead here in the shape of nude young lady is window into the distant age of 1912 lovett is extremely surprised when he get phone call from rose dawson claiming that she is model she is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 years as the memories come flooding back she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer kate winslet the fianc of wealthy cal hockley billy zane and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater frances fisher on board there are rich and poor everyone trust in the ship designer jonathan hyde and her master captain smith bernard hill on board the ship rose unhappy and restless meets jack leonardo dicaprio young american artist poor brave and attractive love story slowly emerges and the two lovers must not only experience the difference between the social classes but also face the greatest power on earth death cameron could as well have called his picture the never ending love or love at first sight as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple and not on the disaster itself the plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble television soap opera the director doesn even try to overcome his empty script because of its primitive and predictable plot titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking russel carpenter rich majestic and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award worthy everything from art direction to visual and sound effects are top notch but it doesn help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them the actors are not to blame because their characters are more like caricatures in other words fake jack is man with many talents he is talented artist handsome brave honest strong funny you name it he doesn have any dark side he doesn make any mistakes that for second would make him human jack is perfect but he is poor on the other hand we have cal he is bastard that treats rose as an odalisque and not as his wife to be he lacks everything jack possesses but he is rich this childish contrast between the social classes is one of those things that makes titanic nothing more than mediocre picture cameron knows precisely what we want to see his film therefore contains certain minimums to draw an audience attractive actors tragic love story beautiful visuals including expensive special effects dose of social criticism fascinating historical event we love true stories and last but not least an incredible media support which proclaimed an average picture the greatest film of all time on the outside titanic looks perfect but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals is emptiness nothing to think about the main weakness of this film which ironically became its success is simplicity cameron enables our basic and if you wish primitive emotions love hate fear and helplessness everyone understands the power of love and the threat to our beautiful couple is likewise imaginable sinking ship titanic is typical hollywood production totally and completely dependent on visual perfection to hide its primitive plot it good picture but absolutely not masterpiece it among hundreds and thousands good films released every year not better or worse than the average american film
it no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between script and the actors involved often makes or breaks movie at the box office poorly written script can be bested by superb acting corps and well written piece can be mangled by group of amateurs in directing his latest action comedy director brett ratner money talks takes relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into funny as all get out buddy cop movie in addition rush hour serves as first class example of directing movie with conservative attitude feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types the two lead names share equal screen time here mostly because they spend it together jackie chan in his first completely american production makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts the other martial arts flick from few weeks ago knock off stands no chance against the content of this one chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise and there no doubt that large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldn believe their eyes the first time chris tucker on the opposite side relates hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan performance he works perfectly with the script and it quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf hand with some of his lines almost essential to the action genre the plot is nonexistent we re quickly introduced to detective james carter tucker is maverick officer for the lapd cut forward to another scene where the daughter julia hsu of the american chinese consul tzi ma is kidnapped by gang of swarthy characters the fbi is quick to the rescue but the consul insists that one of his men detective inspector lee chan be brought on the case to help the fbi resists but then requests that lapd send man over to babysit the chinese detective it here that carter and lee hook up and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up rattner does fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move step up but it doesn quite reach the top tier of action comedies like last year grosse pointe blank there are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan this might be major drawback also some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride and others are there simply to look menacing however none gives standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background almost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another whether it tucker toned down routine or chan tight rein on his action sequences and that contributes greatly to this being watchable movie for all types recommendable visit to the theater indeed
there is nothing like american history in theaters or on video no other feature film takes such cold hard look at the lure the culture and the brotherhood of beyaz supremacy nice guy ed norton jr who sang in everyone says love you plays derek twenty year old skinhead dad subtle racism grew large in derek after gang members killed his father dad was fighting fire when they shot him now derek keeps his head shaved and has giant swastika tattooed over his heart derek is more interested in the ideas of beyaz supremacy than in its culture of violence at basketball court siyah and beyaz tempers flare derek channels the aggression into game siyah versus beyaz for ownership of the courts when the choice presents itself derek goes for game point instead of the sucker punch cameron stacy keach steps in to derek life as surrogate father he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings keeping his own criminal record spotless he uses derek as leader and organizer for high visibility racial intimidation derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in race motivated mob crimes at the bottom of the chain derek younger brother danny edward furlong made famous in terminator joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong one night three siyah youths break into derek truck which is exactly what derek has been waiting for outside in his shorts and his tattoo he shoots them all the third would be thief unarmed is only wounded in the key scene of the film derek commands the kid into position where he can be killed with one glorious enraptured awful stomp the fun spoiling nc 17 of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate considering american history was rated what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are bigger threat to our youth than brutal ecstatic violence the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief derek does not resist the cops and as they spin him around to cuff him the film slows down derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in chilling sadistic satisfied grin now in prison derek faces new challenges as the siyah man in the laundry tells him in the joint you the nigra not me there is clique of swastika wearing skinheads but they are not interested in the ideology of beyaz supremacy they only use the symbols as means of intimidation derek finds himself truly alone truly in danger and truly afraid when derek finally gets out of prison he finds that his friends from the gang have also changed without derek leadership they have shunned the beyaz supremacist ideology for the beyaz supremacist culture it is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he screwed up in the end he spends quality time with is brother trying to undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny the film ends little too deliberately too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film but it barely detracts from the overall experience edward norton gives an oscar worthy performance although some of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction norton performance compensated an example that comes to mind is his pep talk before looting the store he also captured the essence of an older brother he took his responsibility as role model to his younger brother very seriously very lovingly both before and after his change of heart though clearly not for all tastes this film is bold and daring the subject matter is ugly cruel and at times hard to look at nevertheless its subjects are part of humanity great face kaye gives us good look at this fascinating if distasteful american subculture
the faculty the heavily hyped and advertised sci fi horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez 1995 desperado and 1996 from dusk till dawn and screenwriter kevin williamson 1996 scream and 1997 scream is being called cross between invasion of the body snatchers and the breakfast club and don think could describe it any better than that the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common and then the science fiction aspect is added involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town the six characters as in the breakfast club can be easily labeled as stereotype but as they are developed they become far more complex casey elijah wood the much picked upon nerd stokely clea duvall goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being lesbian so everyone will avoid her zeke josh hartnett drug dealer who turns out to be science whiz stan shawn hatosy the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics delilah jordanna brewster the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist and marybeth laura harris the sweet southern new girl in town although the characters are only slightly connected casey is delilah photojournalist assistant marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely since they both don have friends etc when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences the only people they can count on for help is each other even though they aren really even sure if they can trust one another the faculty is another smart and pop culturally hip film from williamson although it does not equal up to his best film the original scream and rodriguez whose from dusk till dawn is still one of the more original genre films of the 90 williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions respectively that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much no brainer the plotline of the faculty involving aliens taking over other people bodies has been done quite lot before from invasion of the body snatchers to the puppet masters to invaders from mars so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh and by setting the goings on at high school and having the protagonists be group of teens they were mostly successful surely the conventions of the story are still the same and the climax was inevitable but there were few surprises along the way including the question of who were the aliens and who weren the epilogue was also refreshing change of pace as it did not set up sequel but ended on note that probably could not have been any better the performances in the faculty were treat throughout since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do one exception were the teens who aside from elijah wood are not very well known but they all aquit themselves nicely particularly wood the seasoned pro clea duvall and jordanna brewster as members of the faculty robert patrick t2 judgement day was creepy as the gym coach piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien and salma hayek as the school nurse with bad case of the cold was very funny in small role the standout in my opinion of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who after turning into an alien becomes the sex bombshell if there was any problem had with the faculty it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the queen alien many of the faculty members disappear it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers although the finale is still pretty impressive and includes some showstopping creature effects especially for relatively low 15 million dollar budget although not one of the best horror or science fiction films have seen the faculty is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released while the story is as old as the hills it is also in way timeless because everyone think has suspected at one time or another that certain person simply did not act right as if they really weren human and by putting this idea in the setting of small town high school it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers note the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading as it features artist usher raymond as one of the main characters in actuality he only has small role as one of stan buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team if were one of the heads from dimension would change this advertising at once since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving
the central focus of michael winterbottom welcome to sarajevo is sarajevo itself the city under siege and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there it proves the backdrop for stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents platoon racial tumultuosness the risible the walking dead or tinge of schmaltziness schindler list the two leads stephen dillane as reporter and emira nusevic as an orphan with plight few can identify with are extremely believable not one moment with them involved rings false the question is not what went right the question is what went wrong for one the film fails to provide political overview of the war as it progresses the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs and that about it the assortment of high profile supporting actors ranging from woody harrelson as yankee reporter into liquor and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as huggable children aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters albeit they strive the interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison still winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy frantic editing and imaginative use of music and it plus because he doesn toy with our emotions with sentimental blandness he wants us to know that in war no one is victorious the sweet hereafter starring ian holm sarah polley bruce greenwood tom mccamus gabrielle rose arsinee khanjian alberta watson maury chaykin caerthan banks produced by atom egoyan and camelia frieberg script by atom egoyan based on the novel by russell banks directed by atom egoyan running time 110 mins rated __________________________________________________________ atom egoyan powerfully meditative the sweet hereafter is as anything as haunting and transcendental as ve seen this year it not only explores the aftermaths of terrible tragedy with magnificent subtlety with cold and stunning shots of the backdrop of this mistfortune but also by telegraphing the sense of devastation that has permeated the small town with an enormous amount of dignity and respect for each and every soul affected ian holm as the somber lonely lawyer seeking compensation for the townspeople has decency and restraint uncommon with lawyers he lion for the wrong reasons the pain for having lost his daughter she druggie who frequently calls him begging for money is reflected on the town and in some mesmerizing flashbacks we witness how she lost her purity it one of the most strikingly breathtaking takes on the loss of innocence ve ever seen but the most astounding part goes to sarah polly the peaceful benevolent girl who in contrast to the other characters remains the most mentally stable during past present or future her ability to convey concealed pain and unconditional love is the opposite yet near revolutionary role that won emily watson an oscar nomination for breaking the waves both women are torn apart by an extraordinary incident but it is only then that we truly see truly feel their wordless omnipotent love the sweet hereafter though is atom egoyan movie and as of now he is emerging as the definite face of independent cinema after surging to worldwide recognition with 1994 exotica the sweet hereafter makes him something few people in this industry can call themselves an artist he interweaves time with delicacy and sees soul with purity that is just not common
after the average mouse hunt the silly small soldiers and the entertaining antz dreamworks try again with the children film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses story as the film warns us at the beginning it not the full story and some liberties have been taken but generally this the bible story we all know and love featuring burning bushes the plagues and the parting of the kirmizi sea the only thing missing is charlton heston instead we get val kilmer voicing moses an hebrew who is placed in river by his mother and rescued by the queen of egypt helen mirren we flash forward several years to see moses and brother rameses fiennes all grown up moses soon finds out from brother and sister miriam and aaron sandra bullock and jeff goldblum that he isn really the son of the pharaoh seti patrick stewart and that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rule he soon sets about this along with his wife tzipporah michelle pfeiffer rameses and his two wizard friends voiced by steve martin and martin short try to stop moses completing his task while the plot is familiar and somewhat exciting for adults for children reared on aladdin and hercules this film could be the most godawful thing they ve ever seen gone is the quick fire humour and standard easy to follow plot but spectacularly and to dreamworks credit nearly every child in the audience was captivated by the story and events happening on screen jeffrey katzenberg who produced this film certainly knows how to keep child interested he included some songs in the film plus some comedy and exciting chariot chase to keep the children interested and somehow himself and the directors still manage to get all the drama and intensity of the story across without ever being boring it remarkable achievement also remarkable is the animation which puts hercules an almost slap dash effort to shame relying on hand drawn and computer animation the backgrounds and characters are amazingly detailed the film seems little caught up with it amazing visuals by showing lot of sweeping visuals and moving shots but they _do_ look incredible the final plague where god kills every first born child and the parting of the kirmizi sea have to be seen to be believed kudos to the animators the vocal talent is also very good val kilmer does fine job as moses although he doesn sing and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses and he _does_ sing sandra bullock and jeff goldblum are great and steve martin and martin short are very good but not in the film long enough finally michelle pfeiffer does excellent work as moses wife kudos also goes to the voice of god who instead of booming and bombastic is quiet and subdued sadly he is uncredited and couldn quite work out who the voice was but mail if you do the songs are good ranging from the usual love sonnets to the traditional big production number they don disturb the movie and while not particularly memorable they are nice to listen to they re well sung aswell the musical score is suitably epic with some beautiful tunes coupled with the superb visuals the prince of egypt is visual and aural treat backed up with great story entertaining both for kids and adults this film is must see david wilcock review 1998 you know for kids norville barnes
this is stagy film adapted from roger rueff play hospitality suite its about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention whose chicago company has sent them to wichita where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel where they aim to score substantial account from the big kahuna someone named dick fuller who is the head of big industrial corporation he is someone they have never met before but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account it is their only reason for coming to the convention the big kahuna revels in salesmen talk among the three beyaz christian males two of them larry spacey and phil devito who are veteran salesmen having teamed together for the last twelve years while bob facinelli is young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and different attitude to their job and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why what comes into question is their opinions on life and death on god and morality and on how they make living these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch their dialogue is acerbic witty and analytical following in the long tradition of salesmen films from death of salesman the tin men and glengarry glen ross as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high in this case it is landing the big kahuna they each are trying to see why he on top and why they are chasing after him what makes this film different than the others is its blatant religious message comparing orthodox religion to what they do as both must sell their product and how after each one psyche is stripped clean by the other there is pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating sales pitch as part of their life bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in bob is baptist who takes very non questioning and literal attitude about religion to just look at another woman and lust after her is sin according to the way he reads the bible when asked by larry why he married his wife he seems puzzled and can even say because he loves her only that marriage is something sacred to him the contrast in their personalities is stark larry is all business he simply wants to close the sale he comes into the room pumped for the convention using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being salesman he criticizes phil for being so placid for getting such small suite for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp and for being burned out he tells him to go on vacation get woman while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating career change now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife after having lived too lonely life on the road for too long he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in he has always been charmer shaking everyone hand trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale larry is more aggressive as salesman he is always heart attack away from every big sale in contrast bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him this is his first time for him on the road when dick fuller doesn arrive at the party the salesmen throw larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering when told that he spoke to the secretary larry throws tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account but when they start talking to bob whom they forced to act as the bartender they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus bob then tells the boys about private party fuller is attending afterwards and that he invited bob to attend larry and phil can fathom how bob didn make sales pitch but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller attention about their company product as they sent him off to meet fuller and will await his return in the hotel room these two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives these three performers were outstanding each understanding what their role called for each coming through with marvelous performance the only problem with the film is that its more of play than cinematic experience but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics give it an intelligent selling point and make it good product to see
showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven director and joe eszterhas writer their last effort basic instinct played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock with dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with hit like curry spiced tabasco sauce dish not to everyone taste but certainly well crafted movie possibly that movie greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage prior to the movie during the movie and after the movie and that after bringing all the plotlines together neatly it left the viewer with full knowledge of what would happen in the characters future so there was no need to film it there was actually about four hours worth of screen story there but eszterhas found ways to get it all on screen in two by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls we have attractive sympathetic but still highly repellent characters we have shows for the eyes and the ears plotlines that play on several levels we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable and we have story of an innocent who may not be so innocent who trying to play straight trying to improve her station in life who slips into behaving the way those around her do but recovers with flourish and quits winner in this sense the movie is bit of departure for verhoeven who not known for treating his characters well but nomi the part played by elizabeth berkley definitely opts out of the game in positive way and we re left feeling good about her future this is not one of the great movies but it far better than we been led to expect by all the negative pre release publicity verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 and in the last quarter century has pushed farther and farther experimenting with the socially acceptable limits to movie making his most recent three movies robocop total recall and basic instinct have been progression of back door access to american culture moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives and now he exploring the sleeze this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director contract contained specific provision that he would not have to deliver an rated movie verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an rating although his original version is available on video many reviewers have taken the politically correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is bad thing but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies it about people in an environment where naked ladies are common and why such an environment should exist it about the scum who use other people as power trip toys and the need to escape their power it about world where sex is nothing and normal human values don pertain and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment an nc 17 movie which isn sexually exciting says great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty power or value the one scene in the movie that could have been good sex scene berkley and maclachlan in swimming pool is not exciting because by then we already know his character is callous manipulator if anything it rape scene with victim who been duped into cooperation you don make movie about the history of siyah people in america without using few siyah actors you don make movie about world war ii without few guns going off and few people getting killed and you don make movie about las vegas showgirls without showing few las vegas showgirls and in an awful lot of vegas shows an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing this is legitimate portrayal of rather seamy side of the entertainment industry in town where sex is simply negotiable commodity showgirls de glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness nomi is played in very good performance by elizabeth berkley who gives us solid picture of woman with limited talents who at the end of her rope desperate to live life better than the one she known she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability and is trying desperately not to to be hooker trying to be something better than she seems destined to be when nomi realizes she gone too far for too little she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be gina rivera plays molly dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi providing her with what may be the one solid positive relationship in nomi entire life molly is the one who makes the difference and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she ll be using for the rest of her life and nomi feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi decision gina gershon plays cristal an aging but still very attractive starring dancer reflexively competitive manipulator who become villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her gershon plays cristal as cross between ava gardner and raquel welch fading talent made bitter by self awareness her character is very well drawn and performed in major scene in hospital room she acknowledges what she is and in essence passes the torch to nomi the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow different path it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe molly is an honest hard working person who means well and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality cristal is talented dancer who compromised her ideals and sold herself to be co operating part of the system exchanging self respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas nomi believes she can make it without selling herself succumbs to degree and then realizes she can make it without selling herself and doesn need las vegas or its brand of stardom the male parts in this movie are simply props they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist kyle maclachlan whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden gives us nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs camouflaged as nice guy glenn plummer plays dancer who working as bellboy and provides bit of alternate perspective plummer character is the only one in the movie who maintaining an interest in dance as performing art but even he succumbed to the cult of manipulation plummer character is the closest thing to sympathetic male character in the whole movie some of jost vacano cinematography is fantastic and one particular delineation of nomi character alteration no dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting is utterly terrifying this movie is rated nc 17 due to language sexual situations full frontal nudity violence and probably the costuming as well don see way this particular story could have been told well without it and regard it as legitimate exercise in movie making but don go see it if you re not in tough mood the only person it possible to like in this movie ends up in an on life support and there is probably not one character in this movie you enjoy meeting in person
one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable you know the one where the detective looks at wall of pictures and other police information and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is sure it been used over and over but for some reason it is always fun to watch this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on overused but always fun one of my personal rules about watching film is not how original the film is but how it goes around giving its story this rule applies highly to kiss the girls there is something psychologically stimulating in well crafted serial killer movie and kiss the girls is certainly well made however the whole film screams of unoriginality and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through well not only are the actors capable of pulling it through but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up unfortunately one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers one that seven film lot like this one knew not to make was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits that may give the actor credit for the role but throughout the film hidden in my mind was waiting for him to appear on screen which spoiled the mystery however credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film plotwise kiss the girls shows almost no originality we are introduced to detective alex cross morgan freeman forensic psychologist and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero he gets call about woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene at his house cross is told that his neice naomi gina ravera has been missing for four days this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer but we are never given chance to establish the relationship between the two and as result we can sympathize with detective cross however what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees before she is abducted dr kate mctiernan ashley judd the actress of the judd family is smart athletic woman and because of these traits becomes target for casanova what the serial killer likes to call himself because of these character developing scenes we care for mctiernan making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful after being abducted mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in cell somewhere in the woods remembering that the killer gave her certain rules she decides to break one of them by calling out when casanova comes to punish her she breaks out and escapes by jumping over waterfall after she is found she begins to help cross find his neice from this moment on kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive many people will compare this film to 1995 seven another killer film starring morgan freeman but presume that the similarities are intentional the screenplay by david klass is adapted from the novel written by james patterson and yet don quite see how this story could have worked in novel form what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness the cinematography by aaron schneider is reminiscient of seven and sometimes felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us sometimes simple shot is the best one however many of the shots are stunning and unlike seven most of them take place during the day in sunlight the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done in more than one way the camera work is terrific but the editing makes this scene work so well the chaotic and mtv type cutting gives the audience sense of confusion and unawareness exactly what judd character is experiencing however the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors morgan freeman is one of today most powerful and believable actors detective cross is very good character for him although it is just similar one to the character in seven because of freeman powerful presence he carries half the film by himself the other half is carried by ashley judd one of today most promising dramatic actresses in fact her performance is better than freeman if that is even possible her character is more original than freeman and she handles it wonderfully we finally have female character in movie like this who does more than just scream the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped but the cast members do as much as they can with it cary elwes portrays cop in north carolina and unfortunately has scraps for character tony goldwyn fairs slightly better but we don really get to know his character either gina ravera gives good performance but again she isn in many of the scenes so as result of all these small supporting parts the weight of the film lies on the two leads and they do phenomenal job some of the best acting of this genre and some of the best acting of the year two other essential aspects of the film are quite good director gary fleder does good job of controlling his actors but the second half of the film loses believability especially during the revelation of the killer he also doesn handle the suspenseful scenes as better director would have losing lot of tension during many scenes however to his credit he does manage terrific first half part of the blame falls on david klass sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more but klass focuses on the two main parts while this may give the two leads more screentime many of the small characters are one dimensional and the killer when revealed is extremely implausible thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel kiss the girls always seems intelligent none of the conversations are laughable and all move the plot forward without seeming forced one of the biggest problems had with the movie was the motive of the killer blame this mainly on the casting director because the killer motive is because of rejection from women or so assume from the opening monologue but the killer himself is very attractive one of my friends is shall we say big admirer of the killer kiss the girls is rated for terror violence language and suggested sex with all the implausibilities of this film and with the mediocre second half kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain in fact had the urge to see it again just for the performances the cinematography adds lot of mood to the already creepy tone and the script is usually smart this is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through morgan freeman is possibly today most convincing actor and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt must also say that loved the ending the showdown between good and evil was quite tense and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer perhaps it may not be possible but most of the film isn anyway
the small scale film in limited release waking ned devine is pleasant excursion to time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of small town filled with breathtaking scenery characters and delightful music the movie would be interesting even without plot the story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in review the film starts out with sharp opening which gives us taste of what is to follow country folk with an inclination for bit of larceny what gets things going is the fact that winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town pop 52 of tullymore who that person is and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie ian bannen and michael david kelly part detectives part scalawags they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds the village consists of several amusing characters clueless pig farmer temporary priest and witch there also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the up and up there are no hollywood touches to this film except for the outer space introduction pacing is right towards the end it runs bit out of steam but that okay because for most of the 90 minutes we ve been interested in the goings on mixture of laughs and occasional sentiment all the right emotions are engaged in one brief dream sequence you ll know it when you see it fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to place you really hope exists one of the key moments in the film the music available on cd london 289 460 939 follows the same arc as the movie and is well worth considering fine film that for everybody except action fans somewhat like the englishman who went up hill and came down mountain but livelier
warren beatty bulworth is caustic political comedy that doesn attack any particular political group but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system some might think this film is vulgar and in many ways it is however as loud and raucous as it is bulworth speaks the truth which is almost always ugly to hear beatty who directed the film and co wrote the script with jeremy pikser the lemon sisters stars as incumbent senator jay billington bulworth who has one of the best politician names in cinema history bulworth is democrat and in beatty view he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party once an ideological liberal like beatty still is bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden which was once the calling card of democrats bulworth has become another sell out money hound if he not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese he making wind bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement america is standing on the doorstep of new millennium blah blah blah when the film opens it is few days before the 1996 primary elections and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become in fit of desperation he takes out $10 million life insurance policy from dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino part of shady lobby deal to kill threatening bill in committee and then hires hit man to kill him although he doesn know who the assassin will be or when the hit will take place knowing that he will soon be dead bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general at compton church he tells the group of african americans that they will have no power in the unless they put down that malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind somebody other than running back who stabs his wife later in particularly hilarious sequence bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he there is because my guys always put the big jews on my schedule all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade bulworth chief of staff dennis murphy oliver platt follows behind in state of constant shock and bewilderment platt has some of the movie funniest scenes as he makes murphy into politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet his constant half truth telling and spin doctoring to cover bulworth stampede is equaled in its perversion only by self righteous reporter nora dunn who acts like murphy refusal to explain bulworth actions something he really cannot do is somehow an act of treason when bulworth decides he wants to live after all and therefore must constantly evade grim looking assassin to be who trailing him at every turn he hides out in the ghetto complete with stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews at this point beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into cartoonish exploration of the siyah inner city experience bulworth becomes friendly with young siyah woman named nina halle berry who he meets at the harlem church rally she has tough talking brother who is deep in debt to local gangster named don cheadle of boogie nights who also becomes involved in bulworth campaign some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true but much of it feels like lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner city films like boyz hood 1991 and menace ii society 1993 bulworth chief liability is beatty insistence on having his character adopt clumsy style of rap as his new communication device instead of speaking at political rallies he breaks into kind of rhythmless rap style that is reminder of why almost all hip hop stars are siyah it hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad or whether he actually that incompetent at any rate the rap sounds more run than snoop doggy dogg which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner city lingo and working that into his speeches instead of trying to sound like cool other than that bulworth hits all its targets with wry hilarious accuracy the film is like letter bomb to the democratic party and even if you don agree with beatty liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics unlike primary colors which opened earlier this year bulworth doesn try to tip toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home instead it takes them dead on
the verdict spine chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king featuring an outstanding oscar winning performance from kathy bates geez french and saunders had field day when they set to work on parodying this sorry non british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders my apologies the pair are british comediennes jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in absolutely fabulous who did series of film spoofs few years back including alien the exorcist and misery needless to say amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates the resemblance was quite uncanny dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder legs but despite the lingering memory of their sketch and although ve now seen the film couple of times now that hobbling scene was no less disturbing still left screaming at the telly in revulsion that may be the most memorable scene but it certainly not the only worth watching stephen king whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality strikes altin with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale it nicely crafted psychological horror which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon james caan rescued from car accident by annie wilkes bates who introduces herself as the writer number one fan he soon becomes her prisoner both the script and kathy bates beautifully masterful performance for which she won an oscar work arm in arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as fruit cake or is that fruity as nut cake bates relishes her demanding role and her performance is nothing short of masterpiece at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour at times she rather tragic character and more often than not she just damned scary this is basically very simple tale but it achieves large degree of eloquence in its simplicity it an involving engrossing experience and considering it basically two hander mainly set in one locale it remarkable piece of cinema there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences this one relies solely upon rob reiner stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan oh haven really mentioned caan yet he does good job as the writer who prisoner of his own success annie is obsessed with him and his books but as you no doubt gathered from the above bates is well and truly the star of the show along with the pig of course anyway the tension is built up with masterful aplomb and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense there the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve shattering lengths to poison her wine he succeeds but she knocks the glass over bet you threw pillow at the screen as well in the immortal words of homer simpson oh other nerve wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house we cut to annie in her car she on her way home he realises this and tries to get back to his room cut to the car again she getting near will he make it ok so these sequences aren exactly original nor perhaps unpredictable but they work boy do they work if film has you on the edge of your couch biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense then it doing something right of course the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned hobbling annie realises her captive has been out of his room and she going to stop him once and for all cue block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and huge sledgehammer and feel ill just thinking about it nasty it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho and then we re given one of the most ridiculously over the top fight scenes ve ever seen she gets hit over the head with typewriter set on fire head smashed against the wall and she just won die sheldon isn in terribly good shape either if it weren so gorey it would almost be laughable but it terrifically effective film and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked misery is tight tense intense and chillingly entertaining thriller the directing is first rate and the performances bates in particular contribute to making this suitably nightmarish little gem wonderful stuff for more regularly updated film and tv reviews check out my site http www geocities com hollywood bungalow 4960

before you read my review you gotta know that love woody allen this is very important note because allen films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone know folks who believe him to be complete genius while others see him as dirty ol schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again love most of his films but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s in fact why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me if you look at the quality of those films you ll hear what saying the only two films of his that really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives in fact secretly hoped that he would take some time off at the turn of the millennium just to re energize or something but it doesn appear as though he has any intention of doing that so here am again reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old plot the year is 1940 and woody allen is top notch insurance investigator his methods are very old fashioned and apparently out of date new employee hunt has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency the two do not like each other one night they are both put under hypnotic trance by magician and unbeknownst to them placed under his control soon thereafter jewels are stolen words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer critique wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies with the fast talking witty banter between co workers catchy jazz score moving things along film noirish elements such as the veronica lake type sexpot one liners galore and fluffy if inconsequential plotline on the downside the film actually starts off pretty slowly with the first hour tossing only few guffaws out there but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy the sets on the other hand were amazing the production design and costumes were perfect and the casting ideal so kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man but it wasn not long before was fully engaged by the characters entertained by the many zingers delivered back and forth between allen and hunt and actually interested in the resolution of the flick also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old parody and actual reinvention note theron entire female persona that is drenched in film noir very cool of course films like this with little or no real tension in the plot need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick fire dialogue and once again allen does great job in playing his character who for once isn his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude he actually plays macho guy here and handles it pretty well especially the scenes in which he hypnotized but the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt an actress who was openly sick of seeing in movies late last year sorry babe you were just in too many at the same time anyway she really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to new era of equality amongst men and doesn miss beat of allen fast paced dialogue didn care much for her running joke about him dying whenever he left room but overall she was really good and especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did yum yum harumph but digress so let recap great looking picture with nice jazzy score some funny one liners especially in the second half decent plotline although you shouldn expect real mystery or anything and some solid acting all around can say that this is even remotely close to any of allen best work but certainly believe it to be step in the right direction especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through it probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else but would still recommend this film to anyone looking for cute old school kind of vibe with chemistry between the leads zippy dialogue and satisfying conclusion little known facts about this film and its stars annie hall 10 10 celebrity 10 everyone says love you 10 husbands and wives 10 mighty aphrodite 10 small time crooks 10 when harry met sally 10 10 you ve got mail 10
wyatt earp has lot to tell and little to say this story of the legendary lawman runs three hours and nine minutes and that too long for this epic wannabe that plays more like tv mini series than movie the story opens on the earp family farm with young wyatt ready to run away from home he wants to fight in the civil war but his dad hackman has different ideas and wants his son to study law time passes and wyatt heads west returns home to marry and after spell begins his career in law enforcement by the time he costner and his brothers madsen david andrews and linden ashby arrive in tombstone wyatt has tried his hand at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards wyatt earp is very appealing in places such as cast costumes and cinematography but an overstated story and overpowered score deaden most of the emotional impact who can be moved by scene after scene after scene of swelling strings and suffocating speeches somber is fine just ask clint eastwood but this film that boasts not one not two but three count em three hammy death scenes still little bit of earp goes long way and the life and times of the legendary lawman are from uninteresting stuff his uh unusual relations with women for example are an intriguing contrast to his character credo of nothing counts as much as blood equally amusing is buffalo hunting and skinning sequence that is decidedly non pc director lawrence kasdan takes refreshingly realistic approach to the gunplay the infamous gunfight at the ok corral is both brutal and brief devoid of almost any theatrics don look for much glorified violence here despite some large exclamation points in the story the characters do come to life the diverse cast includes everyone from betty buckley to mackenzie astin kevin costner is very good in the title role dances with whitney nevers get as steely as the role requires though but his transformation from lighthearted law student to stoic sheriff is fun to watch he was tougher in perfect world his foil is dennis quaid who pulled deniro by losing 40+ pounds to play the tubercular terror doc holliday gaunt and gamely he scene stealer who seen too little other familiar faces include tom sizemore looking like bruce mcgill bill pullman looking like jeff daniels and lea thompson looking like someone other than lea thompson both gene hackman and isabella rosselini appear and disappear like magic while late entries catherine hara and jobeth williams are surprisingly solid though the story and score should ve tried less is more all other credits are technical tops production designer ida random art director gary wissner and costume designer colleen atwood are some of the vips who helped spend what must ve been an enormous budget clearly no expense was spared
ingredients down on his luck evangelist church synopsis sonny dewey robert duvall is tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife farrah fawcett in bed with another guy in regrettable crime of passion he takes baseball bat to the guy head and suddenly finds himself fugitive for murder and estranged from his wife and two kids to atone for his sins sonny flees to rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as new creature the apostle as the apostle sonny main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station soon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple but sonny knows his time is short one day the police will find him opinion this movie is thought provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms believe that robert duvall who is the producer director writer and main star of the apostle deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film duvall portrayal of true believer is authentic superb and inspired it offers the audience completely honest look at southern religion as well as portrait of fallible complicated man driven by his beliefs incidentally in real life duvall was just as driven in getting the project underway since no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing complex movie about an evangelist the apostle as project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done paying for its production with his own money about five million dollars in terms of hard hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade and emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film similarly those with steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle thought provoking experience on the other hand the apostle main strength duvall preaching is also what limits the apostle target audience in terms of plot and pure entertainment value the apostle is definitely not for everyone teenagers action fans comedy fans and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church in other words the apostle is four star performance but with very limited audience
this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood most famous celebrities some fabulous animation and compelling story this is the best we ve seen from disney since beauty and the beast 1996 this film begins an unspecified time following the happily ever after conclusion to toy story in the aftermath of their earlier adventures buzz voice of tim allen and woody voice of tom hanks are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony content with their lives one day andy broke woody arm off while playing with him woody is now officially discarged and worthless left with his nightmares where he lies in trash can with the other discards later andy mother decides to have yard sale and she collects few old toys from her son room since one of these discards is member of the moving toy gang woody goes to the rescue leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back although his mission is successful he is placed in serious predicament when toy collector named al voice of wayne knight spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series woody roundup if he can acquire woody al can ship everything to toy museum in japan for huge profit so after andy mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy al steals him and it up to the other toys led by buzz to go into the city to save their friend and so buzz rex voice of wallace shawn hamm voice of john ratzenberger mr potatohead voice of don rickles and slinky voice of jim varney go out on dangerous journey to rescue their friend they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys there are car chases gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis who by the way resembles darth vader meanwhile woody learns that he was once tv celebrity and has family cowgirl named jessie voice of joan cusack horse named bullseye and father figure called the prospector voice of kelsey grammar they offer him another life as celebrity toy in museum in japan he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for little while before he grows up and be forgotten or be admired by children for generations the problem is if woody escapes from al clutches and returns home they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage real effort is made in the technical department the animation is rich and colorful with lots of wonderful details the cinematography is also extremely improved since toy story there are lot of complicated swings turns and close ups that really make an impression lighting and filters are used to create mood as in surprisingly emotional moment jessie remembrance of her days when she was beloved toy the film contains lot of in side jokes such as the one about videogames and entertaining parodies on jurassic park and star wars the film ends with the failed takes the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film but what in the end makes toy story memorable experience is not the jokes its multiple parodies or marvelous animation it is its heart and emotions the story about the meaning of friendship love and even life itself it is not difficult to predict that toy story would be huge economical success but its artistic achievement was unexpected unexpected because the first film wasn much more than demonstration of special effects but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that years this is big step away from the ancient laws of disney animation off course this is not antz it is not as intelligent this is not landmark and no masterpiece but promise that you ll find it as funny and enjoyable as have whether this is the best animated film of the year dare not say my choice would probably be the iron giant but along side with american pie this is the comedy of the year almost lost my hopes for disney but toy story proves that disney hasn lost their ability to entertain
when initially set out to review this film my tag line was going to be you too can believe whales can fly then it was going to be you too can believe pastel triangles can fly then it was going to be you too can believe wood sprites can fly finally just gave up trying to come up with tag line and decided to say there lot of flying going on in this film as our first host steve martin tells us the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for while because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 grossing somewhere close to $110 000 in its original month of release subsequent re releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved and rightfully deserved to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in fashion no one had seen before six stories high in an exclusive four month engagement from january 1st to april 30th 2000 fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us after the engagement is over the film will be shown at regular theaters is the format effective for the film with few exceptions yes the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven fifth symphony it hard to describe exactly what this segment is about but it involves bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil siyah bat like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts eventually shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat like things and peace returns to the butterfly things though this segment isn very story driven some of the images are very visually strong especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things who are all outlined in blood kirmizi colors begin to overtake the skies the next segment is set to ottorino respighi the pines of rome in this segment some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape whale calf gets into scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack he is finally saved by another liberating shaft of light and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the oceans of clouds again visuals are the key with this segment especially where the whales are involved reportedly the whales as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences are shown as actual size the cgi whales look incredibly life like except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find way out to its parent absolutely beautiful stuff the third segment and the least of the eight segments is set to george gershwin rhapsody in mavi this segment is designed as tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york there construction worker who dreams of being jazz drummer an out of work sad sack that dreams of having job young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by schoolmarm and nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife won go into how everything works out but in fine disney tradition there is happy ending unfortunately the story drags quite bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich piano concerto no and is an animated version of hans christian andersen the steadfast tin soldier one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with wind up clock ballerina whom he assumes is also one legged because he can see her other leg extended out behind her much to the dismay of an evil jack in the box jester the jester knocks the soldier out of window and continues pursuing the ballerina little does the jester know the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl although the ending has been altered from the andersen story the steadfast tin soldier is decently told with in the framework of seven minute short some children may find the jester to be little frightening but otherwise the segment is well made segment five is the funniest of the bunch set to camille saint saens the carnival of the animals this segment features flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with yo yo while they are trying to perform choreographed dance number while it is the shortest clip of the group and throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia it is still well accomplished and welcome bit of comedy segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia and it the one that people remember most the sorcerer apprentice the story is the most recognizable so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo unfortunately the segment wasn made to be presented on large format film considering it was shot full frame and exhibits large amounts of grain there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately but no one seems to notice for some strange reason an anomaly common to many 18 plus screen theaters segment seven is set to sir edward elgar pomp and circumstance march no and is the only other fantasia segment to feature stock disney character donald duck stars as an assistant to noah whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark during the loading donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn make it on the boat they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear jerkers foisted on audiences these days powerful stuff segment eight brings whole new meaning to the clich saving the best for last set to igor stravinsky the firebird an elk awakens forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into beautiful springtime landscape trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about large mountain housing strange formation when the sprite examines the formation it awakens and becomes the titular firebird in stunning spectacle the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path including everything that the sprite has worked to create some amazing animation is present here and well worth the ten dollars ticket alone although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film the host segments are largely no pun intended throwaways although steve martin clip is pretty funny be sure to stay through the credits for little more humor from martin penn and teller are usually funny but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting the best segment comes from of all people bette midler who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board pieces like flight of the bumblebee take on the four horsemen set to wagner ride of the valkyries and strange segment prepared in the 40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments for fans of visual stimulation or classical music fantasia 2000 is perfect way to spend the afternoon the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material as mentioned earlier in the review if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though then you too can believe that whales triangle things sprites can fly [g]
anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases especially hercules emotion all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren going to hold anyone interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together not since disney beauty the beast has there been such compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works the story of the romanov family the rulers of russia and their downfall begins the film anastasia one of the daughters narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin voiced by christopher lloyd with her grandmother voiced by angela landsbury but anastasia gets lost and grows up with no memory of her royal origins the grandmother lives in paris hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution young woman named anya voiced by meg ryan runs across dimitri john cusack and vlad kelsey grammar who are trying to put together scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money they pick anya to pose as their princes and of course it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is commoner and meanwhile rasputin is not dead and plots his revenge against the last romanov the plot is actually quite well structured there are lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later but it moves along fast enough that they ll never have time to be bored what this really means is that the adults won be bored by it either there is great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses there is of course lots of comedy for the kids including rasputin pet bat bartok hank azaria who is easily the funniest thing in the film however the comical scenes never distract from the drama but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly the animation is gorgeous the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators not since beauty the beast have animated characters had so much life to them even without the voices they act the musical number in paris is show stopper with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style as with all recent animated features there are songs however these songs do more than just provide fodder for top 40 singers to get on the radio although there are three of them during the end credits the songs are all very catchy and advance the plot instead of just being showpieces except for the paris number but that so much fun it okay can reccomend anastasia highly enough it wonderful film that ranks right up there with other animated classics kids and adults alike will enjoy it and it also nice to have quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney
robert redford river runs through it is not film watch often it is masterpiece one of the better films of recent years until 1994 it was my second favorite film of all time the acting and direction is top notch never sappy always touching friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because was afraid it would just be really politically correct and tick me off all could do was tell him to go in unbiased and enjoy it is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears but certain memories should not often be rereleased in the last few shots you have to cry upon my first viewing left bawling it is not flawless but it is so very good that you can help but be effected the opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental watching these shots of people who have been dead so long gives you feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films martin scorsese once described the movies as dream state like taking dope and immersing yourself in an alternative world that is what river runs through it does it exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self both times ve seen it its been hard again to quote scorsese waking up but the dream is lovely
richard gere is not one of my favorite actors however like courtroom dramas and this film looked good enough to take chance on wasn disappointed it wasn great film but it was interesting and took several unexpected turns one thing what with the title not only is it extremely forgettable it doesn really have much to do with the film as far as could determine in the long run it will probably hurt the film as people won be able to think of or remember it martin vail richard gere is grandiose defense attorney he loves the money and the fame that go along with defending successfully rich scum such as mafia men and drug dealers once he sees that the accused killer of prominent chicago archbishop is baby faced alter boy he wants in on the case presumably for the press he ll get we soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is former lover janet venable laura linney vail himself is former prosecutor and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney played very well by john mahoney frasier father on the tv series there is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie people have public faces and private faces we see this in the murdered archbishop in the accused and most strongly defense attorney martin vail richard gere does fairly good job at first he appears to be money and attention grabbing lawyer with no consideration of the truth but we see another side as he becomes seeker of justice and comes to believe in his client alfre woodard as the judge is capable though somewhat wasted in standard role laura linney also does journeyman work nothing spectacular but acceptable her relationship with vail is believable their verbal fencing adds to the film the actor who playes vail investigator unfortunately don remember his name is quite good his female assistant she looked very familiar but can remember where ve seen her was also capable but unspectacular the best performance in the film was by edward norton he was excellent as the timid altar boy turned alleged butcher boy of st mike was impressed by the depth of the plot there are red herrings and dead ends that in lesser film would lead to predictable ending liked the plot twists the film took and most of the supporting characters thus give primal fear respectable b+ rating
no man is an island one character quotes john donne in apt pupil effectively summarizing the movie themes while hardly great film singer ambitious adaptation of king short story is challenging nonetheless perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that major studio got behind it apt pupil is bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses 1984 wonder bred high school honours student todd bowden renfro conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again bowden suspects arthur denker mckellan the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby is actually pseudonymous dussander much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd theory bowden strikes deal with dussander in exchange for not revealing his identity dussander must satisfy bowden intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams but like bystander at traffic accident todd desire for gory details overrides his repulsion bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii marching in mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander it leads to his torture of cat and the torment of his student among other things bowden who has taken on very hateful qualities he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook engages the veteran in an endless game of one upmanship dussander stands to lose his freedom and bowden his credibility in effect his post secondary school future all of this winds down to fairly unpredictable and unsettling conclusion one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material excessive climax singer has yet to get keyser ze out of his system his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence verbal tics and todd golden boy reputation are plausible ruses they showcase morally bankrupt anti heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals apt pupil is richer film than the usual suspects movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome there was no way you could see the ending coming as it was all hoodwink anyway thankfully singer has gotten most of the usual suspects film schoolish geek theatrics out of his system some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and or obvious the dream sequences were extraneous but the majority of the film is subdued and singer handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for film about murderer and murderer in training mckellan and renfro performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan finely tuned realization like to single out renfro daring work he isn afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold hearted he strips his character of vanity something many of his peers wouldn do can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor thomas in the same role renfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine hope he doesn continue down that path because he has big future in good movies waiting for him as guidance counsellor edward french friend schwimmer also deserves mention he wants to be the parent to todd that todd own well to do folks are not todd like most modern kids and only children has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger and his sincerity makes the apt pupil blackening heart even more apparent but one of the film ultimate questions are we born evil or do we learn evil might be answered in french whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous no man is an island indeed we all have the capacity to make the right or the wrong choices schwimmer winningly plays one of trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible october 1998 the excellent collection king stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil but the shawshank redemption originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption and stand by me originally titled the body
truman true man burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey character in this film president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide in spite of or was it because of his stature truman also recalls an era of plenty following grim war an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans and burbank california brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc if hollywood is the center of the film world burbank is or was the center of tv world the world where our protagonist lives combine all these names and concepts into truman burbank and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world truman leads the perfect life his town his car and his wife are picture perfect his idea of reality comes under attack one day when studio light falls from the sky the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart but then why would an airplane be carrying studio light the next day during the drive to work the radio jams and he starts picking up voice that exactly describes his movements he is so distracted that he nearly hits pedestrian when the radio comes back to normal the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully his suspicion aroused he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator the elevator doors open up on small lounge with people on coffee breaks grip sees truman him and quickly moves paneled door made to look like the back of an elevator into place two security guards grab him and throw him out truman is really suspicious now it gets even worse the next day when his wife nurse describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge it best not to think about it she says trying vainly to change truman memory truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world you know by now that truman life is the subject of television program his actions are real but everything else is carefully scripted from the death of his father to the choice of his wife truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is meanwhile christof the all seeing creator of truman world does his best to keep him unaware and happy it sort of like westworld told from the robots point of view or jurassic park from the dinosaurs point of view we root for the captive of the cage world our protagonist is counting on chaos theory to help him escape his elaborate trap the story written by andrew niccol writer director of gattaca introduces some interesting questions such as the ethics of subjecting person to this type of life or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake although these questions came to mind don think the film itself asked them it certainly didn address them or try to answer them was particularly disappointed that the film didn deal more with the trauma of learning one life is tv show carrey performance at the end showed smidgen of truman pain but almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film pacing earlier in the movie found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether should root for him to be well the two seemed exclusive of one another but weir and niccol didn see it that way perhaps it not fair to criticize movie for what it isn but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here but on its own terms the movie is well made sight sound and pacing are all handled competently much of the first part of the movie is the truman show the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen the music is well chosen and scored the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music when truman world is still beautiful and perfect when the movie ends the score sounds more like frantic driven tangerine dream opus while still keeping the same timbre philip glass epic music from powaqqatsi permeates truman scenes of suspicion and awakening glass has small cameo as keyboardist for the show and the pacing of the story was brisk there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show just few quick title cards few interviews and then right into the show and the movie one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling there was no token scene of truman idyllic life before it falls apart because it wasn necessary we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble and no sooner there also no point in the movie where the plot slows down it quick straight shot to the movie end in terms of overall quality would compare the truman show to niccol gattaca both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas neither film clicked and became an instant classic nevertheless look forward to niccol next film whatever it may be
