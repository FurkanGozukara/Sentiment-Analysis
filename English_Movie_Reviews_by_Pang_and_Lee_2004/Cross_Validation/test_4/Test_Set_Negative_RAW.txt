   the happy bastard's quick movie review 
damn that y2k bug . 
it's got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . 
little do they know the power within . . . 
going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . 
we don't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don't know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don't know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . 
here , it's just " hey , let's chase these people around with some robots " . 
the acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . 
you're more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . 
sutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he's acting like a baldwin , of course . 
the real star here are stan winston's robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone's brain . 
so , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here's your movie . 
otherwise , it's pretty much a sunken ship of a movie . 

    " in dreams " might keep you awake at night , but not because of its creepy imagery , bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths . 
no , the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie's brutally squandered potential , the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards . 
the big letdown , however , comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan , the man behind " the crying game . " 
he's no stranger to cinematic weirdness , but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope . 
things start out strong enough , with cinematographer darius khondji's stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat . 
this eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film - there's even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic , seemingly innocent new england autumn - but if there ever was a film that didn't deserve so good a polish , it's this one . 
don't knock the look , but say what you will about the foolish plot , underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue . 
annette bening , another asset " in dreams " shouldn't be so lucky to boast , gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn't do much for her in return . 
she plays claire cooper , a massachusetts children's book illustrator who's plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children . 
she thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible , soon-to-be-committed crimes , but neither her ho-hum husband ( aidan quinn ) nor the ho-hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously . 
this being a thriller , we know that she is , in fact , on the money , and it's a credit to bening's acting that she delves equally into claire's madness and compassion . 
but as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims , " in dreams " trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense . 
scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition . 
subplots appear and disappear . 
when claire finally comes face-to-face with our evil murderer ( robert downey jr . ) , it turns out his name is vivian , he's clairvoyant and he's got some major issues with mama , a la norman bates . 
 " in dreams " reaches its absurdist zenith here , and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists . 
some questions , then : what's with the garbage disposal retching applesauce ? 
are the drawings on the wall blood or paint ? 
who cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own ? 
what about the computer ? 
does vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers ? 
why would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan ? 
is the woman in australia integral to anything ? 
and the aforementioned flooded city - what function does that _really_ serve ? 
sigh . 
at least in my own dreams , i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didn't go to waste . 

   forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects . 
set in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon . 
they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells . 
then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes . 
not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood . 
taking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ? 
surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ? 
the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play . 
this is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale . 
the play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play's charged atmosphere . 
in the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora's box . 
not only is credulity stretched but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted . 
it positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot . 
not surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame . 
when the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail . 
with alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail's passion sets all this into inexorable motion . 
abigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft . 
appropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched . 
director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration . 
otherwise , hytner's direction is unremarkable . 
ryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings . 
her fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful . 
abigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here . 
paul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth , but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves . 
probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing , allen's elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character . 
a scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed . 
unfortunately , when john's audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost . 
it is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions . 
his screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message . 
the result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable . 
when the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed . 
far from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience . 

   sean connery stars as a harvard law professor who heads back into the courtroom , by way of the everglades , to defend a young , educated black man ( blair underwood ) . 
the guy is on death row for the murder of a white girl , and says that his confession was coerced from the region's tough , black cop ( lawrence fishburne ) . 
watching connery and fishburne bump heads for two hours is amusing enough , but the plot's a joke . 
there's no logic at work here . 
tone is also an issue--there is none . 
director arne glimcher never establishes exactly what his film is trying to say . 
is it a statement on human rights ? 
is it a knock-off of silence of the lambs ? 
glimcher never tells . 
instead , he forces his characters to jump through hoop after hoop , over drawbridge after drawbridge , hoping that the audience won't notice what's missing . 
just awful . 
the madness of king george 107 min . 
/ not rated ========================== 
still wondering who nigel hawthorne is ? 
then check out his oscar- nominated work in the madness of king george , still playing in both raleigh and chapel hill . 
stage director nicholas hytner , in a remarkable screen debut , has adapted alan bennett's 1991 tragic comedy to fine effect . 
sumptuous-looking and only mildly stuffy , the film charts the madness that plagued king george iii ( hawthorne ) almost 30 years into his reign . 
a man of no importance 98 min . 
/ rated " r " ====================== 
in suri krishnamma's a man of no importance , albert finney disappears so deeply into the role of a lovable dublin bus conductor that it's a shame when the film gets so serious around him . 
his character is a conductor with a passion for oscar wilde . 
he reads to his riders , and once a year , with their help , he tries to stage one of the author's plays . 
this year it's " salome . " 
for about an hour , there's a sweet magic behind finney and his troupe of working-class stiffs . 
conflict arises , but it's small stuff--an administrator from the bus company here , an outraged catholic pork butcher ( michael gambon ) there . 
but with finney at the wheel , so to speak , the film rolls smoothly over these plot points--just like the gorgeous leland double-decker bus in the story . 
where things get serious is toward the end of the film , when the plot takes a turn that the bus never would , and the story heads down a very dark alley that marks the end of an enjoyable ride . 
the twist makes sense--and helps paint a complete picture of finney's character--but the trip to get there betrays the light , airy atmosphere of what had come before . 
it's not a fatal misstep , mind you , and it doesn't send the story soaring into the realms of incredulity . 
it's just a turn off . 
dr . strangelove 93 min . 
/ not rated =============== 
mein fuhrer ! 
the most fun that * i * had last month was in durham , at the carolina , at a mid-week screening of stanley kubrick's pitch-black comedy dr . 
strangelove ( or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb ) . 
the 1964 film stars peter sellers ( in three roles ) , george c . scott , sterling hayden , and slim pickens . 
their antics brought the house down , which , to my surprise , was packed by an audience younger than the film . 

   when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy , i expect negative reviews from critics left and right . 
predictable , unoriginal , and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you's and the drive me crazy's released by the dozens these last couple of years . 
what i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while i'm sitting in the theater . 
am i enjoying myself ? 
is this a comfortable break from my week of finals ? 
this is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks ; i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i won't remember next week . 
so last week i opened up the new york times - and , no surprise , boys and girls got a negative review . 
daily news ? 
negative . 
reelviews ? 
negative . 
epinions . com ? 
negative . 
this was nothing new . 
american pie , final destination , road trip didn't get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures . 
same goes for she's all that , a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded . 
since boys and girls reunites she's all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr . , i predicted d ? j ? vu al over again . 
but , still curious , i asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it , the reactions were far from positive . 
i had made up my mind ; i'll catch it on video or cable in a couple of years . 
but , soon after , following a series of unexpected events ( we couldn't get into shaft because it is rated r ) , i found myself watching boys and girls . 
whoops . 
boys and girls is about a " nerdy , smart " boy named ryan ( prinze jr . ) and a " popular , flirt " girl named jennifer ( claire forlani ) . 
briefly meeting as pre-teens and now attending the same college , the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends . 
but in the movies , a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other . 
with advice from their roommates ( amanda detmer , jason biggs ) , ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship . 
the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives - and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found . 
i could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons . 
the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie , mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to . 
it is almost offensive . 
an example of an insightful conversation : 
 " you're dumb . 
dumb , dumb , dumb , dumb . " 
 " no . " 
 ( followed by a mandy moore-esque tune background ) 
 ( well it's not as bad as wing commander i guess ) 
the supporting cast is also painfully useless . 
detmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring , pointless subplots . 
and although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex , prinze jr's ryan dominates the screen while forlani's jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him to work with . 
we never learn anything about jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character . 
teenager or not : you'll hate this movie , i guarantee it . 
maybe i should rent she's all that again . 
is it really as good as i think it is ? 

   one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles . 
he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish , and one of his best was his last film , lone star . 
after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us-mexico border , expectation ran high for his next film . 
unfortunately , his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for . 
we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do . 
then the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is . 
the plot of men with guns can be summarized " in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas . 
dr . fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went . 
and he found out again and again and again . " 
of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell . 
a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians . 
but the film talks down to the viewer . 
dr . fuentes ( played by federico luppi ) teaches medicine in the capital city of his country . 
he has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios . 
fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service . 
then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy . 
in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others . 
the student tells him the others are still in the mountains , but suggests that it may not be a good place to be . 
fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors , ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general . 
the results are little different than one would expect . 
dr . fuentes starts out incredibly naive . 
even some american tourists , present in the film mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr . fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains . 
but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was . 
sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians . 
the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences . 
federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos . 
damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter . 
mandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer . 

   late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states her greatest fear is having an " artificial conversation " with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr . ) . 
the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy . 
the film is a multi-million dollar testament to everything artificial . 
filled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster . 
prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles' freshman co-ed . 
at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out-doing the previous in how " cute " it can be . 
the happy couple " psychoanalyze " each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze's dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love . 
then , in standard romantic comedy style , things fall apart . 
why ? 
well , because they have to . 
otherwise the couple can't make up and live ( presumably ) happily ever after . 
down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic . 
scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism , but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead . 
a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre , not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together , or even knowing each other , but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat . 
the supporting characters are remarkably flat , and insultingly ridiculous as well . 
stiles' best friend ( rosario dawson ) is a pot head , prinze's roommate ( shawn hatosy ) is a girl crazy fool who can't meet women , and then there are the porn stars ( zak orth and selma blair ) . 
he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television , does the college lecture circuit , and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film . 
you know , the average porn star . 
the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he's on screen , the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes . 
she is a porn star mostly so we know she's slutty , so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted . 
attempts at drama ( which means julia is going to cry ) include a pregnancy scare and the big break up . 
these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes . 
what happened here ? 
the cast is full of likable , promising , young actors ( stiles especially seems to be going places ) . 
writer/director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off . 
in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year's extremely unpleasant the story of us , for teen audiences . 
the direction is film-school-grad obvious . 
it's stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen , a pointless parody of " cops , " characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters , and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion . 
plus , the whole story is told flashback style , narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera . 
this is the second film in a row ( following wing commander ) starring freddie prinze jr . which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she's all that . 
if he doesn't start making better choices fast his future films won't be so lucky . 

   five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there ( is this starting to sound familiar ? ) by mistake . 
the girls accidentlly open the box ( big surprise , huh ! ) and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one ( betcha didn't see that one coming ! ) . 
hard to die , i found out while watching the film , is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 : nightie nightmare ( r . a . m . r . # 
1521 ) . 
two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film , robyn harris and melissa moore , but they play different characters here . 
orville ketchum is also back as ( get ready for this ) orville ketchum ( yes , the same character from number two ) . 
yes , he is also built like a tank in this film too . 
i'm telling you , a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn't harm him at all ! 
the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act , well they seemed to have lost that ability . 
thankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock , which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film . 
the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks . 
any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line . 
the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out , analyzed , and discarded before it happens . 
there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot . 
while we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress . 
the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager's office . 
i'm sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more ( if that is still possible ) . 
the script for this film is completely pathetic . 
the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible . 
the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along . 
here is an example of the wonderful dialog . 
the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun . 
the line is " my dad used to be a marine , i bet i can work it . " 
this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy . 
now , we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan ( ? ! ! ? ) has been presented . 
one comment from an actress is " not a lot of strategy involved , but i like it . " 
i'm afraid folks that this is about as good as they get . 
now lets talk about the great special effects for this film . 
this obviously wasn't a big concern of the film makers . 
the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer's intelligence . 
a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie . 
are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get ? 
the continuity department was obviously asleep ( along with the viewers ) when watching this film . 
in one shot , actress has cloths on , camera angle changes , actress seems to have lost clothing . 
very impressive trick ! 
the one ( half ? ) 
plus that this film has going for it , is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious . 
the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny , and so the viewer can get some enjoyment ( ? ! ! ? ) from the film . 
however , this doesn't make it worth the rental fee of over a penny . 
in the acting department , the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down . 
i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic , but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least . 
oh well , win some , lose some . 

   another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like " waking ned devine , " and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . 
it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . 
the strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . 
the film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . 
but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . 
its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia . 
the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america's jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america's drug usage and drug supply . 
billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . 
everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . 
the film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . 
there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . 
the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . 
the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . 
he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . 
the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband's enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . 
she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . 
what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . 
even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . 
her gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . 
since she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . 
the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . 
for grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . 
the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace's greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can't control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . 
the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn't want matthew to end up in jail . 
it is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . 
the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . 
the film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . 
things work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . 
there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . 
this 'unhip' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . 
ummm ! 

   note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
be forewarned . 
i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species . 
squandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley's a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain't ) . 
miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they'd dare tempt fate and go for another round . 
so here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid . 
the film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . 
in other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there's a catch -- he's an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who's now infected with alien dna . 
patrick's overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . 
and when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick's primary focus turns to her -- " if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable " warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . 
species ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around . 
however , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered . 
mr . brancato's original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches . 
like the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there's a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious . 
last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker's psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- " something bad happened here . " 
this time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter " this is awful . " 
and she's not even empathic ! 
and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who's telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , " he's going to rape her . " 
while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own . 
there's an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn't really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( " he's in aisle 1 ! " 
informs eve ) . 
if the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion . 
much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it's terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief . 
the implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve's brain ? 
why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ? 
my favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks . 
this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it's being foisted upon the public . 
returning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there's realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis . 
mykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick's neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film . 
mr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) . 
ms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that " she's so empowered . " 
a lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that's * what i call empowerment . 

   roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , " who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . . 
ben kingsley ? " 
my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it . 
they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles . 
the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious . 
that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast . 
gary " gal " dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain . 
life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing . 
but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch . 
the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa . 
the second punch comes from gal's past . 
back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal . 
he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal . 
don will accept any decision gal makes from " yes " to " certainly . " 
however , if gal says " no " don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) . 
in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin . 
kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness . 
there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming . 
when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success . 
beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him . 
any local hood could have done what gal is needed for . 
additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault . 
no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool . 
in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar . 
i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade . 
the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability . 
the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im . 
it is not a great plot . 
in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards . 
perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film . 
it is an old plot dressed up to look new . 
if the plot is old , at least the style is creative . 
this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout . 
his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences . 
cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes . 
we see one side of a person's faces . 
but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit . 
half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden . 
us yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog . 
at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language . 
sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film . 
the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western . 
further respectability comes from ben kingsley's high-powered performance . 
i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 

   some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others , almost as gifted , have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable . 
as was amply evident after basic instinct , sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon . 
rejecting her natural abilities , she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type . 
gloria is her latest disaster . 
babe ruth didn't quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity , and neither should stone reject what she does best . 
janeane garofalo , for example , is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone's part in basic instinct ; neither is stone any less talented because she couldn't do garofalo's comedic roles . 
gloria , directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes , was not screened in advance for critics , almost always a sign that the studio isn't behind the picture . 
after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened , it is clear why they held it from the press . 
it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed . 
as the story opens , an angry gloria ( stone ) is being released from prison after 3 years confinement . 
she's got a bad attitude and a big mouth . 
she also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents , a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast . 
an annoying child actor named jean-luke figueroa plays a soon-to-be orphan named nicky . 
just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria's ex-boyfriend kevin ( jeremy northam ) , nicky's dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin's operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice . 
 " be a man , " his father lectures him sternly . 
 " don't trust nobody . 
not no broads . 
nobody . " 
most of the film's leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power of the automated time and temperature announcements . 
add in the movie's almost non-existent background noise and the excruciatingly slow pacing , and you can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones . 
lumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life painting . 
they stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass for discourse . 
 ( " say you're my baby , " kevin coos demandingly . 
 " i'm not gonna , " gloria pouts back . ) 
the movie has a plethora of logical flaws and implausibilites . 
the kid rarely seems the least bit worried or scared , no matter how many people are after him with guns , trying to kill him . 
and in one key scene , the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it and is further assumed never to have been copied . 
gloria , who keeps saying how she hates kids , takes nicky under her wing and protects him from kevin and the bad guys . 
think her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends ? 
if you don't know the answer , you may be just the right viewer for this film . 
you have to say this for stone : she can keep a straight face . 
when explaining life to a 7-year-old kid , she says with utter seriousness , " you got a lot of love making to make ; you got a lot of boozing to do . " 
gloria runs 1 : 48 . 
it is rated r for profanity , violence and brief male nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers . 

   what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project . 
most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films . 
john frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60's , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin . 
screenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd . 
ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes . 
even charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn't act , did a decent job in cider house rules . 
when all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining . 
after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration . 
the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining . 
the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are . 
it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights . 
we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar . 
the actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun . 
reindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don't seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn't look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest . 
evidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled " boy this movie is horrible ! " 
and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments . 
the story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) . 
nick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person . 
when nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays . 
unfortunately ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship . 
thinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard . 
now rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel . 
confused ? 
the movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax . 
but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour . 
the hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley . 
some hero . 
the point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire . 
when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times . 
the most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason . 
the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead . 
the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food . 
why he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me . 
why any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me . 

   the ads for " batman and robin " scream " the event of the summer is here " and that's the problem . 
the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it . 
 " batman and robin " is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance . 
it's like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun . 
it wasn't always this way . 
tim burton's " batman " was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge . 
the film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel . 
batman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night . 
the joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent . 
batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city's breathtaking gothic skyline . 
those days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck . 
 " batman and robin " has far more in common with the campy 60's batman tv show than with tim burton's tale of darkness . 
the blame lies with director joel schumacher . 
a former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes . 
unfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn't the faintest notion of what to do . 
 " batman and robin " is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it's often difficult to tell who's whacking who . 
while the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti . 
a few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film . 
 " batman and robin " doesn't merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions . 
it's rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one . 
ironically , the parts of " batman and robin " that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne . 
easily the best batman yet , clooney's expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn't even hint at . 
the film's most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne's butler and surrogate father . 
as for the other heroes , chris o'donnell's robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl . 
in a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne's girlfriend is puzzling . 
i suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight . 
of course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that's where " batman and robin " really suffers . 
as mr . freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion . 
laboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he's having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act . 
uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy . 
she overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it's apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s/he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) . 
once thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss . 
thurman fails to maintain the character's maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film . 
the biggest lesson to be learned from " batman and robin " is that more is not better . 
joel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is . 
some critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam . 
i don't think so . 
my prescription ? 
fire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist's convention so he'll understand that there's no hard feelings ) . 
give alicia silverstone her walking papers , while keeping clooney , o'donnell and michael gough . 
call jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman . 
then , ditch the campiness and , for the love of pete , lose the " event " mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time . 

   what are we going to do with jim carrey ? 
viewers of television's " in living color " know this one-man cartoon from such characters as fire marshall bill . 
viewers also know that " in living color " is a skit-show and that a little of jim carrey goes a long way . 
unfortunately , this fact was forgotten by the makers of the carrey comedy ace ventura : pet detective . 
three writers , including carrey , worked on the slapstick story , which sends a self-styled " pet detective " on the trail of a stolen dolphin . 
the missing mammal belongs to the miami dolphins , who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl . 
for plot porpoises , this story works as well as any three stooges short . 
carrey gets to do his " official " schtick as he snoops around greater miami . 
he leers and sneers , craning his neck to funny effect . 
he even does his captain kirk impersonation . 
again . 
all of this is pretty harmless stuff up until the point that you realize that the writers have absolutely no intention of focusing on anyone * other * than carrey . 
 ( suggested alternate title--jim carrey : will do anything for a laugh . ) 
export it to france and you may have a hit . 
as it stands , ace ventura isn't even good kid's stuff . 
the profanity count , alone , is too high . 
which is ironic , since children are , probably , carrey's best audience . 
the film doesn't even have the goofball charm of chris elliott's recent no-brainer cabin boy . 
sure , carrey has his moments . 
but what can you say about a film whose high-points include watching carrey slink around to the theme from " mission impossible ? " 
ace ventura has one glaring incongruity . 
amid the butt-jokes and double-takes , the script takes great pains to set-up an elaborate and rather funny " crying game " gag . 
and , for * this * intended audience , that takes ( ahem ) cojones . 

   as with any gen-x mtv movie ( like last year's dead man on campus ) , the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points : sex and football . 
those two items , wrapped in a guilty-pleasure package , are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially , but sales will decline for two reasons . 
first , the football sequences are nothing new , nor can they be ; the sports genre isn't mainstream and it's been retread to death . 
second , the sex is just bad . 
despite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all-night strip-club party , there's nothing even remotely tantalizing . 
the acting is mostly mediocre , not including the fantastic jon voight . 
cultivating his usual sliminess , voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer . 
kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes' twenty-two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years ; this year he plans to make it twenty-three . 
unfortunately , when his star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , goes down for the count , he's got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon ( james van der beek ) . 
moxon leads the team through its last four games , and then must cope with his newfound stardom , the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie ( amy smart ) , and other temptations that abound in football-crazy west canaan . 
most regions of the country are not nearly as football-crazy as texas , and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most . 
similarly , the set design is wrong for a high school setting : the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms , radio headsets ( which never seem to work , however , and instead require coaches to signal plays manually ) , and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer . 
these elements ( as well as the heavy drinking and carousing ) might be more appropriate on a college campus -- but mtv's core audience is the high school demographic . 
this focus is further emphasized by the casting : james van der beek , of tv's " dawson's creek , " is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero , although he never manages to do anything with the role . 
other stars are similarly young and unmemorable . 
there's not much that goes right about varsity blues , and there's not much to like about it , either . 
everything herein has already been done , and if it hasn't , the movie manages to botch it one way or another . 
this is certainly missable . 

   i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part 3 . 
the best way i can put it is that it's funky . 
i know this is an odd question , but remember the opening music of " police academy 4 : citizens on patrol " , when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song " citizens on patrol " during the opening credits ? 
it's just like that . 
anyway , part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2 ( so technically still 1985 ) . 
this time , a group of horny teens ( who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason ) head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed . 
it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life ( which must have been between parts 1 and 2 ) so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murders is beyond me . 
she's the lone survivor this time . 
part 3 was originally shown in theaters in 3-d , and from what i can tell from the video , it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects . 
jason had long , wild hair when he was unmasked in part 2 . now , one day later he's completely bald . 
also , it being one day later , it can't be friday the 13th now can it ? 
oh well . 
steve miner is the only director who helmed more than one film in the series .

   in " the astronaut's wife , " charlize theron plays a young woman with a nervous demeanor , pixie-hairdo and demon spawn unwittingly growing in her belly . 
if only her name wasn't jillian , the makers of this embarrassing bit of sci-fi shlock could have come up with a far more appropriate title : " rosemary's species . " 
what a shame it is to see such a gifted actress as theron - oscar-worthy in " the devil's advocate " - struggle with the lamest rip-off of a screendom classic in recent memory . 
ok , maybe " the astronaut's wife " deviates from " rosemary's baby " turf for its set-up , which finds our heroine terrorized not by satan's minions but her possessed husband ( johnny depp ) , a shuttle pilot whose mission mishap leaves him , um , a changed man . 
predictably , he and the missus get it on in a sequence best described as unpleasant , his evil seed impregnating her with twins and realizing that great " bowfinger " line about " alien love . " 
theron's " advocate " character faced a similar dilemma , the horror there resonating strongly . 
 " astronaut " provides only artificial anxiety . 
last year's equally noodle-headed " species ii " spun a similar premise about the breeding habits of an extraterrestrial on earth , but at least that movie more or less knew it was garbage . 
 " the astronaut's wife " is grave and humor-free , passing its increasingly silly story off as full-fledged serious , right down to an ambiguous finale that isn't even going to satisfy those who've stayed with it thus far . 
here's a hint : it involves lots of water , electrical equipment , a special effect from " the abyss " and the tots who doubled up as adam sandler's co-star in " big daddy . " 
draw your own conclusions . 
director/writer rand ravich coats the proceedings in dynamic sights masterminded by legendary " e . t . " 
cinematographer allen daviau , but too often favors the film's visual presentation over the story he's trying to tell . 
this bodes horribly for each dramatic development , like the surfacing of a suspicious nasa official ( " speed " 's joe morton ) to instigate jill's slow and stupid comprehension of the truth . 
his hyper-erratic behavior is probably supposed to give wife a paranoid edge . 
instead , he adds to the phoniness . 
theron and depp are certainly beyond this junk and will get other chances to prove themselves this fall - she as part of an imposing ensemble case in the john irving adaptation " cider house rules , " he in the lead of tim burton's eagerly-awaited " sleepy hollow . " 
undeserving of such talent , " the astronaut's wife " manages to be derivative , dull and uninvolving despite its seemingly ripe potential for unintentional laughs . 
in space , no one can hear you scream . 
but in a movie theatre , everyone can hear you snore . 

   first troy beyer wrote the critically panned " b . a . p . s . " 
now she makes her directorial debut , writing , directing , and starring in this sub-par film about women talking about sex . 
though not without redeeming qualities , this film is bad . 
the basic story follows three single friends -- jazz ( beyer ) , lena ( randi ingerman ) , and michelle ( paget brewster ) -- in their search for love . 
jazz has an idea for a local talk show ; it would feature women talking about sex and dating . 
she and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami . 
the film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout , both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters . 
the fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film . 
there are several moments of bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension . 
in a low-budget independent film from a first-time director , these faults can sometimes be forgiven , if the screenplay is fresh and solid . 
that is not the case here . 
the script suffers from random plot developments . 
there are four or five of these turns in the plot , each one raising the question " where did that come from ? " 
at one point , a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother . 
we are supposed to be moved , but since the scene is completely un-led-up to , we really don't care if she and her mother get along . 
we've never seen her mother before . 
we never see her again . 
who cares ? 
what's worse , these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy . 
at another point , a character announces that she can't have children . 
apparently , this is devastating . 
we wouldn't know this because she never talked about having kids before , but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her . 
the scene feels like an afterthought , its emotion manipulative and shallow . 
these scenes grow worse and worse , culminating in an absurd climax . 
two scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing . 
one scene is a lover's spat between two minor characters . 
the other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax . 
thinking on these scenes , it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities . 
but it does . 
first , it is original . 
we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups , and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea . 
it's something i don't think has been the subject of a film . 
second , the interviews of the miami women are sincere . 
taken together , they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners . 
the mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes , but each tile is some woman's real experience . 
neither the picture of women , nor their picture of men , is truly representative , but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way . 
at some level , the stereotypes that emerge can be called true . 
i can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their " likes , dislikes , skills , and thrills , " but on the whole , it's pretty bad . 
and that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension . 
i'll give beyer one more strike , and then she's out . 
rated r ( almost got an nc-17 ) for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity . 

    " spice world " is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls . 
sure there's a hint of humor in there every once in a while . 
actually , there's a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls . 
but overall , who cares ? 
not me . 
if you don't know by now , the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power , yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood . 
in " spice world " they ride around in their big tour bus , whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews . 
amazingly , all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things , things they want to do , not things they are required to do to keep earning money . 
and they keep babbling about " girl power " when they should really be talking about " cleavage power " . 
i mean , if all it takes is girl power , then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits ? 
the film is pg , but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions , you'd have yourself one raunchy adult film . 
by the way , there's something in the opening credits which says " based on an idea by the spice girls " . 
wow , they got idea credit ! 
i certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood . . . 
giving credit for simply having the thought " say girls , let's make a movie ! " 
the supporting cast fares well . 
roger moore ( the real james bond ) mockingly plays the cliche-spewing " chief " of the spice girls , and darn it all , he's fun to watch . 
mark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the band's manager ( richard e . grant ) . 
one question though : george wendt ? 
you'd think that " spice world " would envoke one of two reactions in people . 
if you like the spice girls , you'll like them even more afterwards . 
and if you can't stand them ( like me ) , then " spice world " will really make you sick . 
oddly , the audience i saw the film with , roughly 50 twelve year-old girls , sat in silence for the entire film . 
well , not the two who sat directly behind me . 
they kept muttering " this is stupid " over and over again . 
maybe there is hope for humanity after all .

   synopsis : blond criminal psychologist sarah chooses to copulate with greasy tony the mysterious puerto rican rather than bearded cliff the wisecracking neighbor upstairs . 
in the meantime , someone sends sarah rotting flowers , puts her name in the newspaper's obituary column , and kills her cat . 
comments : never talk to strangers , a colossal waste of time , moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious to the audience 20 minutes into the film . 
one wouldn't think that two genuine movie stars , antonio banderas ( evita ) and rebecca de mornay ( hand that rocks the cradle ) , and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller ( " saturday night live " ) would be involved in such a celluloid backfire as this turkey . 
not only are they in it , however , but de mornay executive produced it . 
what was she thinking ? 
never talk to strangers centers upon sarah , a psychologist examining the ill-tempered max , a murderer soon to stand trial . 
she receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy in her early childhood . 
two men woo her ; tony the " security consultant " wins her over ( so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music ) . 
a lot of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality disorder , but the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd and sarah , and instead offers several male characters as red herrings . 
86 minutes , the running time of this cinematic mess , thus , seem like 86 hours . 
a good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah and tony . 
why would the career-minded , professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a black hat called tony ? 
that's one of the film's mysteries which are never answered . 
regardless of motive , de mornay and banderas strip down and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism . 
they also manage to go out before copulating occasionally -- in one of the stupidest scenes of the film , tony takes sarah to a carnival that's * right outside * his dingy apartment ( that way , they can hurry back and have sex quickly ) . 
also , apparently , the weather changes quickly in their locale : they're at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex ; the next day , they're out playing in the snow before having sex . 
the filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony and sarah's " character development . " 
someone is out to get poor sarah ( though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this starts ) . 
rotting flowers , a writeup in the obituary , and a beaten neighbor are just a few of the bad things which happen to her . 
suspense cliche number one also occurs : whenever someone is stalked in thrillers , by any means , if the stalked has a pet , that pet will die . 
oftentimes , to even further the cliche , the murdered pet is a cat ( suspense filmmakers , for some reason , just don't like cats ) . 
sarah , in never talk to strangers , receives a package and , lo and behold , discovers her mutilated cat within . 
suspense at its very derivative ! 
as stated before , never talk to strangers is a poor excuse for a film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting banderas and de mornay's bodies as often as possible . 
comedian dennis miller is completely wasted here ( he's not given lines that are suitable for his persona ) and doesn't even appear all that much . 
maybe , in a way , he's lucky for that . 
early on in the movie , sarah tells tony , after meeting him in a supermarket , that she had been advised to never talk to strangers . 
allow me to advise that you never watch this stinker . 

    " mercury rising " has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . 
that's right . 
the major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better . 
this central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic . 
his name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . 
simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . 
the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of " mercury rising . " 
i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon's character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . 
miko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he's touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . 
it's a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn't playing like he's autistic . 
unlike dustin hoffman's performance in " rain man " or leonardo dicaprio's in " what's eating gilbert grape , " we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . 
however , unlike " rain man " which used its character's autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , " mercury rising " could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . 
hell , he doesn't even have to be shy . 
in fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis' arm . 
willis' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything . 
he becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon's house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide . 
of course , we know that isn't the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents . 
simon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked . 
jeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . 
this is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon's parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes . 
late in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop . 
of all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . 
i can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey's character is far too accommodating . 
not only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . 
the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . 
the movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here " mercury rising " doesn't rise to the challenge . 
the movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including " sea of love " ( 1989 ) and " malice " ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . 
there is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . 
the grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it's more suspenseful that way . 
taken as a whole , " mercury rising " is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor . 
usually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . 
this is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . 
maybe the book was better , but the way it's handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore . 

   as you should know , this summer has been less than memorable . 
with a total of 4 decent films , it's not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing . 
with that said , you can pretty much predict what my opinion on " the 13th warrior " will be . 
the film is based on the michael crichton " eaters of the dead " , in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king . 
after tarveling for many months , he comes across a gang of norsemen , who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog . 
so , they start picking men , and are left without 1 , thus ahmed is choosen . 
so far it sounds interesting right ? 
not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes . 
after that , they basically run around killing . 
that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film , because once your story is introduced , you have the rest of the film to start developing it . 
obviously that's not the case here . 
even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure , you will be disappointed . 
since all the action takes place in fog , it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances , and to poor camera work . 
can't the camera men sit still ? 
i'd like to actually watch a film in focus , but again , they failed to deliver that as well . 
the film moves on and on until the point , where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you're eating . 
with corny dialogue , that the characters laugh at for some odd reason , a script that goes nowhere , dull action sequences , a predictable ending , and worst of all weak characters , there's basically nothing to like here , except for maybe the set designs . 
that's the only thing that honestly caught my interest . 
when i heard that john mctiernan , the director , wanted his name kept out of the project , that made me wonder why ? 
well now i know . 
crichton's greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product , which led to a big arguement . 
what's there to argue about anyway ? 
the film couldn't be saved , no matter how much they spent or casted . 
seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money , i wouldn't be surprised to see " the 13th warrior " become a hit . 
please do me a favor and save your money at all costs , or else you will be lost in the fog , like the film itself . 

   if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films , i might say that i review movies that don't look particularly good because i'm doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it . 
if that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : " shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don't have to . " 
but i know that's bunk-you're going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say . 
so i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie . 
you know the feeling , when you're sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly . 
sometimes i think that's why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever . 
admit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies . 
so do i . 
so i saw " supernova . " 
truth be told , " supernova " wasn't quite as bad as i thought it might be . 
maybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn't started tinkering with the director's ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed . 
maybe i'm becoming a softy . 
in any case , i didn't find " supernova " as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe . 
but it's still bad . 
the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel " nightingale . " 
the crew includes captain a . j . 
marley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) . 
there are some attempts at " characterization , " but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) . 
don't expect any more explanation , because you won't get it . 
anyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent . 
during the dimension jump ( i think that's what it's called , but don't hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board . 
he calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with . 
then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening . 
have you seen " alien ? " 
have you seen " event horizon " ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? 
good . 
then you've seen " supernova . " 
post-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either . 
after all , no one's going to think for a second that troy won't turn out to be a villain . 
but the bigger problem with " supernova " is that it can' t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded . 
numerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it's a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped . 
was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? 
did the ship's computer learn something about humanity ? 
what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? 
and just what does the film's title signify , if anything ? 
as far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn't developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements . 
character relationships in this film also make very little sense . 
for some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex . 
we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes . 
bassett and spader's characters start off hating each other . 
fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they're engaging in some hanky-panky . 
when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him . 
every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut . 
the most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! 
furthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits . 
maybe that's why the film's title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster . 
right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you're seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations . 
the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby . 
point b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing . 
doesn't make sense . 
since i didn't understand anything about these characters' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? 
not a whit . 
it's a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do . 
they don't find it . 
bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces . 
sexual tension ? 
more like constipation . 
maybe they're just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as " this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . " 
not that we ever find out who that is , mind you . 
the climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film's biggest forehead-slapper . 
as troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . 
he' s awfully one-note , but it's not as if he's given any more notes to work with . 
the rest of the cast does even less . 
tunney stands around looking cute , then scared . 
phillips broods . 
cruz flirts with the computer . 
then they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn't paying much attention by then . 
 " supernova " is pretty awful , but i'm cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . 
that's it . 
if you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you'll probably hate it more than i will . 
even the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn't going to save the film . 
honestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? 
it usually results in a bad movie , and that's what " supernova " is . 

   when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions , i turned to my friend and said , " dangerous liaisons for kids ! " 
it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense , owing everything it is to stephen frears' 1988 masterpiece . 
imagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits . 
and i was impressed . 
in fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie . 
it's kiddie-porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs . 
i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they're smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined . 
cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do . 
i also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be . 
phillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont . 
wow . 
isn't that a memorable name ? 
i could just say it over and over again . 
sebastian valmont . 
it kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich . 
sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can't have , no material object out of his reach . 
he has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips . 
and , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don't really exist . 
the ones who do are irritating . 
sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants . 
since these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons . 
kathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn . 
but it's too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the " paradigm of chastity and beauty . " 
so , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here ) . 
but -- dear god ! 
-- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove . 
dangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting . 
cruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting . 
kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her . 
she is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons . 
gellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive . 
witherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character isn't the moral staple she's supposed to be : sure , she won't have sex until she's in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible . 
but i can't forget mr . phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness . 
i have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions . 
and there's one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone . 
true , he is bad , but it doesn't help that he has no character to work with . 
kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch . 
the film fails in every other way , too . 
first of all , nobody talks like this . 
even the " intellectuals " i know don't bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering . 
for a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there's no way we can join it . 
cruel intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene . 
earlier i mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie . 
so , if we hate them , then what's the point of an extended sex scene ? 
titillation , of course . 
it can't even work under the pretense of " meaningful love scene , " because we hate the characters . 
it's interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons . 
kumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film ; many of the scenes have a similar tone , and there are moments in frears' film that kumble imitates almost completely ( such as the last scene , in which [spoiler warning ! ] the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers ) . 
but kids don't act like this . 
nobody acts like this . 
in his translation , roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy -- some pretty crucial elements . 
the result is a picture of confounding badness , a kiddie-porn mess that thinks it's really deep and profound . 
i'll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences , but that doesn't change the fact that it's awful . 

   everyone knows that old rule , 'never work with children and animals . ' 
in this latest horror flick mimic case , it's 'never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals' instead , as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience . 
the film begins in new york , where we see children dying from a mysterious disease , which is being carried by cockroaches . 
dr . susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the 'judas' breed ) , however , which is designed to kill all cockroaches . 
the bug does it's job , the cockroaches all die , and the terror is gone . 
'three years later' appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill . 
the spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it's predator , and in this case . . . . it's 
humans . 
that should teach us for squishing all those bugs . 
what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace . 
perhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the 'predator' type movie it could easily have become . 
if it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest . 
the director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie . 
there are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking . 
if the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it's sadly babbling nonsense . 
in fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better . sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come , with the script not bothering to develop them . 
there is some action in this film , but it's directed in such an annoying way , it's just infuriating to watch . 
the camera cuts all over the place , disoreitating the audience , and instead of involving the audience in the action , it merely alienates them . 
the peformances are o . k , if slightly below average . 
sorvino is o . k , although she's not very good at conveying terror , or anything emotion really . 
the supporting cast are all sterotypes , with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth , a geeky scientist with spectacles , and what could be the most stereotypical mexican 'old timer' ever . 
their reasonable good fun , however . 
mimic , then , may fail with it's story , pacing and characters , but the film does look good . 
like dark city , mimic is a definite case of style of content . 
it may be a bit too gloomy for it's own good , but the sets look nice , and parts of the film are directed well . 
but looks aren't good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre , somewhere where it shouldn't really belong . 
a good opportunity , then , wasted . 
a shame . 
overall rating= review by david wilcock ? 1998 

   8mm , written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker , has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery . 
nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles , who is asked by upper class toff mrs . christian ( myra carter ) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe . 
the movie happens to be an mythical 'snuff movie' , where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed . 
all mrs . christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not . 
welles agrees , and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies , with video clerk max california ( phoenix ) as his guide . 
although the 'snuff' industry hasn't really been examined in mainstream cinema , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most . 
the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away . 
8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much , and apart from a few moments , most of the action in the film is nothing you haven't seen from another standard thriller . 
the cast help towards the entertainment , apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage . 
while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ( 1987 ) , ever since leaving las vegas ( 1995 ) , cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot , such as in the terrible snake eyes ( 1998 . ) 
here , in 8mm , he's boring , uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice . 
and in this overlong thriller , these virtues do not help keep the suspense up . 
only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving , as phoenix is a true talent . 
his performance is a great break away from the gloom , and he's just purely enjoyable to watch . 
catherine keener is completely wasted as cage's wife , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves . 
her character , though , is hugely underwritten , one of the most wasted characters of the year . 
also fun is fargo's peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director . 
as this film is written by the person behind seven , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch . 
unlike seven , 8mm isn't too clever , and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives . 
lacking the strong characters seven featured , 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise , and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment . 
but director joel schumacher , the completely wrong guy for the job , puts style over content , and while the direction and look are good , it's just not very disturbing . 
schumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience , and though we are meant to be looking at the 'dark belly' of the porn industry , it doesn't exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind , which misses the point . 
also , the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed , so cliched , it's amazing to think it's the same film you're watching . 
8mm is far from an success , a 'snuffed' opportunity . 
with a boring lead character , 'controversial' scenes that manage not to be controversial , and a director obsessed with looks , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller . 
ultimately , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like . 
and trust me , the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it . 

   let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official ( and even unofficial ) james bond series . 
it is so full of self-parody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof . 
an omen of what is to come is provided by the pre-credits sequence , a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man ( it's difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie ) and the assassin of the title . 
a song with woefully terrible lyrics follows , and the rest of the movie is even worse . 
the plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule-the-world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s , but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin , francisco scaramanga ( christopher lee , putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie ) who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moore's 007 . 
there is also a flimsy connection with the energy crisis and a missing solar cell with 95% efficiency . 
it's as much of a mess as it sounds . 
bond is " helped " in his task by mary goodnight ( ekland ) , whose character couldn't possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo . 
during the course of the movie she gets locked in both a closet and a car trunk , blunders around a control room accidentally setting off a laser and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever . 
maud adams ( later to star in octopussy ) is a much more stronger and useful character , but she hardly features in the movie . 
scaramanga's lackey is a dwarf called nik-nak , who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series , serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures . 
worse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie . 
there is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in ( not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists -- another misguided attempt at humour ) . 
the solitary car chase might have been a highlight , but the " action " is interrupted on a frequent basis by a redneck sheriff ( j . w . 
pepper , played by clifton james of live and let die " fame " ) yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window . 
he is easily the most irritating character in a james bond movie . 
even his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history , a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge -- could have been , except somebody got the idea to dub a mocking whistle tone over the final print . 
on top of that debacle , the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga's " funhouse " . 
the only good thing that came out of this movie was that the producers had to make the next film in the series ( the infinitely superior " the spy who loved me " ) a great film in order for the bond franchise to survive . 

   wolfgang petersen's latest , the perfect storm , is like a pineapple . 
it only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging - if you try to eat the fruit , spikes and all , it's going to hurt ? quite a bit . 
ok , maybe that was a confusing analogy , so here's my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick : there isn't really much of a story to tell . 
basically , a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat , called the andrea gail , and gets stuck in the middle of " the storm of the century . " 
how much time does it take for petersen to tell this story ? 
not nearly enough . 
so he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous . 
audiences want to see the storm , they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched , maudlin drivel . 
the last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect , but just try lasting the first three-quarters . 
i have yet to read sebastian junger's the perfect storm , but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale . 
based on a true story , the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version , the approach is weak . 
using a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner , petersen almost hides the in-your-face banality . 
right away the central characters are introduced : the gritty , determined captain ( george clooney ) , the ingenue ( mark wahlberg ) torn between his job and his girlfriend ( diane lane ) , the loving father ( john c . reilly ) , the comic relief who's always trying to get laid ( john hawkes ) , the new guy ( william fichtner ) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet , french guy ( allen payne ) . 
so many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer . 
it is not the all-star cast's fault , just the characters designed for their portrayal . 
allen payne's character never speaks in the entire movie , not because he is mute , but because he's never given any lines ! 
are we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with ? 
fichtner's character is terribly underdeveloped - we don't know what he's doing there , where he's from , or who he's supposed to be . 
the remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes ( hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene " you know what would look good on you ? 
me ! " 
ooooh real creative ) . 
as the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters , the crew continues to not feel human . 
only when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk . 
the computer-generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real . 
i can only imagine if this was an imax film , this city kid would surely never go in the water again . 
this is loud , jolting entertainment - adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film . 
the perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment . 
the maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so . 
i guess i'll stick to that other survival spectacle ? you know the one on cbs ? 

   this movie is based off the wildly popular video-game series of the same name . 
before this film , the game had a few spin-off cartoons- which were ok . 
but the idea of doing a movie is insane . 
it should have been animated , if it should have been done at all . 
instead the people do the best they can with a talented cast . 
yet it still fails . 
the plot is completely different from the game's plot- i'm not complaining about that . 
the story involves the mario bros . having a plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company . 
eventually they find a construction site by their nemesis , which happens to be enviromentally un-safe . 
so , due to luigi's ( john leguizamo ) girlfriend - princess daisy - they go and investigate . 
they get transported to a blade runner-esque world lead by king koopa ( dennis hopper ) . 
somehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic mega-city jumbles in . 
the plot is fine- better than the movie deserves . 
the acting is ok . 
this seems to be more of a visual film . 
the special effects are good , especially on the robotic yoshi . 
however the film drags and is no fun . 
and it leaves itself open to a sequel , which probably won't ever be made . 
this movie begins sort of promising , but ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth . 
so if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper , then watch super mario bros . : 
the movie . 
you could do worse . 
but you could definitely do better . . . 
 . 
street fighter : the movie ( 1995 ) starring : raul julia and jean claude van-damme 
this movie was based off of a series of never ending sequels to a game called street fighter 2 . it has all the characters from the game in a reasonable plot . 
it is more like a " movie " than it should be . 
yes , it's watchable . 
raul julia does a good job , considering this was his final film . 
while the game had non-stop fighting sequences , this movie is a hodge-podge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same time . 
does it work ? 
sort of . . . 
the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m . bison ( raul julia ) . 
guile ( jean claude van-damme ) takes his troops to attack bison's main base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over . 
in a short amount of time , the movie introduces several characters well . 
it catches your attention . 
but it ultimately seems like a showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like " there's chun li ! ! " 
or " look at that fire-ball ryu did at vega " . 
it hits the bases by presenting the characters in a plot with good sets , but goes no further . 
this movie needed more action in the first place . 
the action scenes that are here are short and not very exciting . 
if you like light-hearted action flicks , or if you liked the game , watch this one . 
it is even worth watching if you want to see raul julia's last performance , or if you can't get enough of van damme . 
other than that , you could find better action flicks .

   studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it's a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring , cliched individual , not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn't be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio , which they did according to this film . 
are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ? 
 " 54 " belongs in the elite group of films known as " the big disappointments " : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished . 
i was heavily awaiting " 54 , " not the least because i've become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that's been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this " edgy " film . 
perhaps more importantly , " 54 " is part of the blossoming subgenre , " the 70s nostalgia film , " which has been picking up mighty steam , what with " boogie nights " and " the last days of disco " coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from " boogie nights , " and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from " the last days of disco , " not to mention several others . 
 " 54 " deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that's all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it . 
this is a definite plus . 
here's a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening . 
the story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let's look at how it all affected the people . 
but this film doesn't let that happen . 
it gives us a half-assed protagonist named shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe , from " i know what you did last summer " ) , who's chief character trait is the fact that he's from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) . 
he's dim-witted , into being part of " the scene , " and soon finds he's become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars . . . a 
bit like " saturday night fever , " 'cept no travolta and no real interest put into him . 
poor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half-assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been . 
shane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from " clueless " ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame . 
although he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that's all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film . 
the film's sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all-too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) . 
rubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that . 
notice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who've only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails . 
first time feature director mark christopher proves that he's a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much . 
his story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject . 
it's as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route . 
the studio's recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough . 
some people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film's tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini's " la dolce vita " ) , and when i watched " 54 , " i didn't particularly want to stay . 

   topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devil's advocate : movies that have a brilliant beginning but don't know how to end . 
it begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other . 
there is liz , who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment , prue who is getting married , geoff , liz's boyfriend , neil , her previous boyfriend , ant who has written a screenplay . 
for the first hour , we get to know these people through everyday activities , as they talk on the phone , go out to dinner , hang clothes on the line . 
the interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film-makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them . 
at times , the events border on the ridiculous , like the screening of the film , but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives . 
this doesn't sound like a brilliant premise for a film - " we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related " - but it's the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing . 
unfortunately this level of honesty isn't maintained . 
with about half an hour to go , a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama . 
such a disappointment after such a brilliant start . 
the actors are all quite good with ms . danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive . 
the energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable . 
a lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film . 
it seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles . 
that is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock . 
up till that point , i was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place . 
while the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility , it's unlikely in a way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film . 
not just the events , but also the tone of some of the end is wrong , clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it . 
this is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film . 
as stated above , the first hour is superb and even the end is above average . 
it just takes a turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss . 

   the event horizon is the boundary of a black hole . . . 
and , in the future , it's also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than the speed of light by traversing through its own portable black hole . 
naturally , this is the setup for the other event horizon . . . 
the movie . 
when the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at , just outside of neptune , the crew of the ship called the " lewis and clark " has to go to investigate , and dr . william weir , the creator of the " event horizon , " gets to come along for the ride . 
if you've glanced at a poster for this movie , you know that , supposedly , what follows is " infinite terror . " 
well , i don't know about the " terror " part , but " infinite " certainly seems to qualify . . . 
event horizon is a mean-spirited , gory , sick excuse for a film . 
it starts off as an alien rip-off , and then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes . 
at least for those first 40 minutes it's an * interesting * rip-off of alien . 
that's a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie , which seems to go on forever . 
it not a scary monster movie , nor is it a psychological thriller . 
it is simply a movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore . 
you've seen this kind of movie before . 
the hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility . 
this is a kind of movie for which i have no respect , a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago . 
it is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore , but event horizon takes the low road , and the viewers pay the price . 
there are many good , respectable performances , from fishburne and neill most noticably . 
paul anderson's direction is impressive , as it was in mortal kombat . 
there are many nice special effects , mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero-gravity . 
the sets are beautiful to gaze upon . 
and richard t . jones' character ( cooper ) is hilarious and extremely likable ( more so than most characters i've seen in recent movies ) for the little screen time that he has . 
and none of this can save the movie from being a d-grade level of film . 
the idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls , a life that knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers , is a promising one . 
a haunted house story in space isn't such a bad idea . 
but the final execution is extremely disappointing . 
that's not to say that philip eisner ( here making his feature film-writing debut ) doesn't have talent . 
for those first 40 minutes , he manages to make a tired premise interesting , adding in aspects of unique flavor into a rip-off story , and that's something that not too many writers can do . 
he even has one scene that , though it also tries to sicken the audience , has a honestly tense feel to it ( the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space ) . 
he definitely has something of a gift , but it's not fully on display here . 
i certainly will look forward to seeing more from him , and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise . 
but because of what this movie degenerates into , i have little or no respect , and got little or no enjoyment , out of it . 
if this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film , then i agree with laurence fishburne's sentiment - " god help us . " 

   deserves recognition for : making this relatively youthful critic feel extremely old and crotchety20 
capsule review : this is what feel-good family entertainment has morphed into in the 90's : an hour-and-a-half commercial , disguised as an unnecessary remake , in which the defining image is that of a grown man launching a volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass . 
 ( between this , rocketman , and george of the jungle , disney has recently eclipsed longtime champion troma as the studio most likely to include a fart joke in a film . ) 
as the absent-minded professor who invents the titular computer-generated goop , a listless robin williams manages the difficult task of making original lead fred macmurray seem sprightly . 
the only thing that made this film borderline tolerable for me is my newly-founded but firm belief that writer/producer john hughes is going to spend his eternal afterlife being conked in the noggin by all of the different blunt instruments he's used for comedic effect in films like this and the odious home alone series . 
take your kids to see boogie nights instead . 

   any movie that kills emilio estevez off in the first fifteen minutes has something going for it . 
unfortunately , this and the familiar theme music are the only worthwhile things about mission impossible , directed by brian depalma . 
the first problem is that this film has absolutely no connection with the tv show whatsoever , aside from the music . 
the tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork , orchestrated by jim phelps , allowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world . 
teamwork was the key . 
this film is set up as a cross between james bond and depalma's " blow out , " where the john travolta character was the victim of real and imagined conspiracies from all directions . 
it was travolta's vulnerability that made that film so exciting and claustrophobic . 
in this film , tom cruise is basically omniscient ( believe that ? ) and so there's no fun going on here whatsoever . 
the story is about as contrived as contrived gets , and is full of holes . 
there are basically two memorable sequences : one involves breaking into a kubrickesque computer room -- a task that could have been made much easier had the characters a whit of common sense ( suffice it to say that the alarm system is disengaged when the computer operator is in the room ) ; the second involves a high-speed train , a helicopter , and the chunnel and does not have to be seen to be disbelieved . 
the actors are all miscast , especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife , who cannot act , and ving rhames as a computer hacker ( ! ) , who looks lost and embarrased to be in this movie . 
tom cruise is no james bond , and jon voight looks more like bobby " the brain " heenan than jim phelps . 
brian depalma's career has been bafflingly erratic . 
at his best , he beats hitchcock at his own game ( " blow out , " " carrie , " " body double " ) but this is not his best . 
the screenplay was partly written by robert towne , who wrote the best scenario of the seventies in " chinatown , " but this script is perfunctory at best , and terrrible at worst . 
the cinematography has a comic book red/blue emphasis , which is nice to look at , but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed and this movie even features the old " killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving the victim time to think of an escape " trick . 
please don't spend your money on this ; it'll only encourage hollywood to make more . 

   the summer of 00' wasn't a very good one for devout cinephiles . 
it offered no blair witches or sixth senses ; the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient x-men adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update . 
nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season , that battery-charging ( at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o' shit that moseys into multiplexes ) time of year when all those oscar contenders ( read : " quality " films ) compete for audiences . 
alas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season . 
it's also indie director neil labute's first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture , and i'm sad to report it's a resounding failure ( at least on this web site ) , a mess that's as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labute's previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic . 
i went in expecting something decent , for betty was gleefully praised , it's screenplay even winning an award at cannes , but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment . 
are critics so desperate for something unique that they're blind to how derivative the particular brand of " uniqueness " betty dolls out is ? 
for the first time labute is working from a script he has not written , and he seems unsure of how to handle the material . 
betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction ( this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men ) , enchanting like the wizard of oz ( of which this film makes several allusions to ) and heartwarming like [stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie] , but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation . 
it's labute's half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesn't even seem to have half that heart in it . 
nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict , betty ( brilliantly played by renee zellweger ) , who witnesses the killing of her husband , del ( aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife ) by two hit men ( morgan freeman and chris rock ) . 
she happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities . 
she's blocked out her husband's death and thinks she's a character in her favorite soap , a reason to love . 
betty sets out on the road to la ( with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk ) searching for her soap boyfriend dr . david ravell ( greg kinnear ) while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit . 
the labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men , slipped a bit ( but not much ) with his sophomore effort , your friends and neighbors , then fell straight on his ass with bash , a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime . 
the play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist , only labute's persistence in wallowing in the horrid things " average " people do to each other , usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are . 
in the play , paul rudd , as an obnoxious jock , delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death , while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim " boys will be boys " . 
another character , schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby ! 
what was once so powerful about labute's work , the casual , nonchalant cruelty and selfishness ( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree ) had become so over the top it was borderline comic . 
obviously , at this point , labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further , but nurse betty isn't it . 
he clearly has little passion for what he's doing here , instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks ( one of the hit men is a huge soap fan , and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn't managed to transcend that ) tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience . 
nearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down , as the two are made to enact soft-boiled tarantino-esque dialogue . 
they evince little chemistry , with rock constantly in over the top rant mode , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that's represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ) . 
i think rock is a great comic yet he hasn't been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies , whenever he acts , and no matter the part , it's like he's doing the damn chris rock show . 
surprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , apple pie looks . 
that wide-open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirty-year-old body . 
it's the best work she's ever done . 
freeman is effective as always , though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it . 
the actor plays the role in his usual calm , collected manner , though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty's , suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality . 
that's interesting but the movie doesn't do anything with it other than crash land the sub-theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle . 
the film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie's in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it ) but nothing jells , it's parts , good or bad , are so disparate as to be opposing . 
the film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film , a mainstream , female forrest gump or an oddball art film , but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke . 
betty's screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence , without which betty wouldn't make any progress in the film . 
nurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter , like how betty becomes a nurse in the film , a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover ; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim's wound because she happened to see how on tv , which leads to her being offered a room with the victim's girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear ? ? ? a little too tidy , don'tcha think . 
betty has an interesting theme , though it doesn't even seem aware of this . 
the current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother , with more on the way . 
this is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ( ironically real-life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ) . 
instead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze ( since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television , albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the '80s than the '00s ) , the film simply uses betty's delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b . no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation . 

   upon first viewing of this movie , the phrases " been there " and " done that " come quickly to mind . 
spy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films , the most popular of which are airplane and the naked gun series . 
stealing stuff can be profitable in this industry , but only when you steal the right stuff . 
what little plot there is involves dick steele , aka . 
agent wd-40 ( leslie nielsen ) trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy griffith . 
along the way to it goal ( goal ? ) , the film manages to spoof mainly the james bond type films , but also manages to hit on films such as home alone and sister act . 
the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny , or at the least , satirical . 
spy hard achieves neither , as it borrows all of the wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films . 
the " dick , the world is in danger . 
what is it ? 
well , it's a big roundish ball floating in space around the sun . . 
 ( i'm paraphrasing ) " type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film , each time getting progressively less funny . 
what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brother's films while writing their own dialogue . 
director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors ( especially nielsen , who can do this quite well ) than on the delivery and context of their lines , much of the time cutting the punchline short . 
the whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over , as is evident in the final sequence , where there is no comedic denouement after the climax . 
as was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard , the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context . 
one of the more amusing was , " captain of the enterprise . . . . . . james

overall , i thought this was a very weak effort . 
while all of the right films to spoof were chosen , they used none of the right spoofing methods . 
next time they should " spy " a little bit harder .

one of a kind . 
must see .

worth the price of admission . 
 * * = fair . 
nothing much special . 
 * = what were they thinking ? ? 

   it should have been a classic . 
a great cast of respected supporting actors . 
an interesting premise of loser comic book characters . 
however , " mystery men " proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999 . 
the jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals . 
the number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise . 
the script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laugh-out-loud joke and mediocre small jokes , it failed miserably at being entertaining at all . 
the jokes were not funny for a number of reasons . 
they had been used a number of times before in previous films , the best ones , which were mediocre to begin with , were ruined in the trailer , and the expectation of laughing at clever , unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film . 
 " mystery men " might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business . 
but with veterans doing this kind of junk , it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought . 
thankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie . 
the film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy . 
the fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero , captain amazing , who has recently captured every evil-doer in the city . 
captain amazing ( played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear ) , because of his success in the past , is worried that he will lose popularity . 
after freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city ( geoffrey rush , overacting just a bit too much ) to keep himself busy , things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured . 
it is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day . 
by the time this section of the plot is finished , the interest for what happens ( if you haven't already figured it out ) is very low . 
there are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention . 
the first scene in the film , which shows the wannabes trying to save the day , feels like it was seriously edited down . 
right when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folk's home by some masked goons , captain amazing comes in and saves the day ? or ruins the movie . 
instead of editing this scene , more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and monica , a waitress ( claire forlani ) or the vast majority of the film , which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was . 
a simple rule : more silly action is needed in order to make a silly action movie work . 
another major problem with " mystery men " is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances . 
the film depended on its cast to work fluently together , like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion . 
however , most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way . 
to pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of a hat , paul reubens , who disappeared from acting to everyone's joy , returns here leaving very little to be impressed about . 
as a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon , all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes . 
fart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of " american pie " and " there's something about mary . " 
 " mystery men " drags on towards the end to a point where anything else in the world is more entertaining . 
anyone with a brain knows each one of the heroes is going to be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going to contribute in a helpful way . 
so why continue to watch ? 
this film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure . 
 " mystery men " indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says " i knew you could do it ! " 
 " mystery men " fails in every category it attempts to pass . 
what makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable . 
terrible acting , terrible script , and a terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors . 
 " i'm unpredictable ! " 
an overexcited ben stiller shouts out . 
no ben , you're the complete opposite . 

   for a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones , it is surprising to find the messenger : the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess . 
in the early to mid 1400's , there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman . 
the church was a dismally dark and oppressive place . 
france was involved in " the hundred years war " against england . 
there was no strong political leadership in the country . 
morale was low , there being little hope for the future . 
it was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing " voices " and seeing " visions . " 
convinced that these were messages from god , she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him . 
the message : if he would give her an army to command , she would deliver to him the crown . 
he does . . . 
and she does . 
then , once seated on the throne , he abandons her to her english captors . 
director luc besson ( the fifth element ) may have co-wrote the script but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material . 
the inconsistencies of the cast , the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes , the inappropriate musical score , and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable . 
his biggest miscue was to cast his wife , milla jovovich ( the fifth element ) in the title role . 
ms . jovovich , looks spectacular as joan , clad in battle armor , astride a similarly protected horse . 
if looks were enough to fully convey a character , she would have been brilliant . 
since it isn't , she tried ( and failed ) to act the part . 
her joan is unbalanced , " inspiring " the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed . 
john malkovich ( being john malkovich ) fares a bit better as the dauphin , who joan would see on the throne as charles vii . 
an easily manipulated man , his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death . 
faye dunaway ( the thomas crown affair ) gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphin's mother-in-law and chief advisor . 
the army under joan's command are comprised of comical figures , more stooges than soldiers . 
the one exception would be tcheky karyo ( la femme nikita ) as dunois , the man who was leading the attack prior to joan's arrival . 
trying to plan a systematic campaign , he sees his leadership authority negated by joan's insistence on following her " visions . " 
dustin hoffman ( sphere ) has a small inhuman role as joan's conscience which begins speaking to her while awaiting trial . 
dressed like cloaked monk , he leads her to doubt herself and her " revelations . " 
as well she should . 
scriptures do speak of revelation . 
god , via his gift of holy spirit , is able to communicate to men . 
three of the nine manifestations of holy spirit listed in 1 corinthians 12 deal with receiving revelation . 
they are : word of knowledge , word of wisdom , and discerning of spirits . 
even the scriptures themselves are a result of god giving revelation to his " holy men . . . 
who spake as they were moved by holy spirit ( i . e . 
by revelation . ) " 
but the scriptures also caution us : 
 " beloved , believe not every spirit , but try the spirits whether they are of god : because many false prophets are gone out into the world . " 
1 john 4 : 1 [kjv] 
joan's end , ( being burned at the stake at the age of 19 ) , the frenzy ( mob rule ) and blood lust her inspiration wrought , and the death , pain , or suffering which followed her campaign all point to a devilish influence rather than a godly one . 
while her conviction and intense believing remains an admirable quality , she was , as others have been before and since , misled by the spiritual master of deception . 
as a messenger , she was quite effective . 
she was just confused as to whose message she was carrying . 

   the yet-to-be-released krippendorf's tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but buyer beware . 
this movie can't make up its mind . 
is it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies , menstruation , circumcision , and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them ? 
or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort ? 
either way , " unbalanced " is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort . 
the premise is catchy - widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) has spent the past two years " getting over " the death of his wife , neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses . 
now it's time to show what he's achieved in those two years , and he has absolutely nothing to show for it . 
with a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea , krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous $100 , 000 grant was spent on trips to mcdonald's . 
but when his " discovery " becomes the latest craze among colleagues , the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe - he must create it . 
with the aid of his three children , the headstrong teen shelly ( natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you ) , the slightly younger mickey ( gregory smith ) , and the nine-year-old edmund ( carl michael lindner ) , the " shelmikedmu " tribe ( named from the first half of each child's name ) is born , and videos quickly produced in krippendorf's backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe . 
despite the professor's wishes , the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows , due in greatest part to veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , an overly vivacious ( and voluptuous ) anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorf's main assistant . 
hungry for recognition , micelli sets up interviews , lectures , etc . in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history , a sure fire way to go down in the history books . 
krippendorf , on the other hand , is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor , not in history books , and with each new lecture , he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe - mating habits , domestic structure , etc . thru fumbling improvisation , and often some quick thinking from his oldest son , krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture , but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe . 
on the opposing end is krippendorf's arch rival , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) , an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the non-existent tribe . 
it's a cute idea , and approached with a more subtle ( and mature ) style , krippendorf's tribe could've been a real winner . 
sadly , the mostly-misfired toilet humor , overly comical musical score ( by bruce broughton ) , and sugar coated sentiments ( all the key ingredients of a " family comedy " ) just aren't the right tone for this film . 
cut that crap out , add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and you've got a good start . 
at the state it's in now , you've got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs . 
doubtfire meets dumb & dumber , and that's not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try . 
the overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of " average " , with a few laugh-out-loud moments and a great big gap in between them . 
most of the characters are surprisingly two-dimensional , and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort ( lyonne ) seems to go greatly unappreciated . 
director todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways . 
it's stuck in limbo between disney family fare ( jungle 2 jungle ) and potentially hilarious adult comedy ( a fish called wanda ) . 
it's this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade , and it's a brutal drop . 
a strong warning to parents : forget the impression given by advertisements , do you want to take your kids to a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely because she's holding his penis ? 
yes , it's put that bluntly ! 
just be warned - this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film , and others might not be as tame . 

   phaedra cinema , the distributor of such never-heard-of classics as " soft toilet seats , " " trailer : the movie , " and " the one armed boxer vs . the flying guillotine , " has sneaked its latest release , " the sculptress , " into a few theaters this weekend hoping to cash in on a handful of halloween holidaygoers looking for a right good scare . 
 " the sculptress " is a scary proposition all right , but not in the way its producers intended . 
from the outset it's easy to see why some of the larger , more reputable chains aren't carrying it : the film looks like a straight-to-video release from the early '80s that's been dusted off ( not very carefully ) and re-issued in theatrical format . 
that staple of schlocky z-movies jeff fahey ( " the lawnmower man " ) plays a washed-up shakespearean actor lacking in some basic people skills . 
when he's not reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment , screaming scotch-induced " hamlet " soliloquies well into the night , he's out and about on the streets of san francisco stalking loose women . 
fahey's dobie sizes up his victims ( actually just one , a peep show performer name of sylvie ) dressed like one of the guys from kraftwerk , and approaches them in the ridiculous attire of a bavarian count replete with a cane , dark glasses , and a false beard ( just in time for halloween ! ) . 
 " do you have a castle ? " 
sylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallet outside a coffee shop . 
 " jah . 
with ze many turrets " is dobie's perplexing reply . 
the real " star " of the film ( and i use that term extremely loosely ) is katie wright , who plays the sculptress of the title . 
sarah is new in town , studying at the prestigious sf art institute under the mentorship of a " genius " frenchman , played by the beret-wearing patrick bauchau . 
that's convenient , because sarah would one day like to live and work in paris ( you won't believe the film's final shot , with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop and " rosemary's baby " -inspired imagery ) . 
bauchau's character criticizes sarah's work publicly ( her clay busts keep turning into gargoyles--perhaps she's possessed . . . 
by an incubus ! ! ? ) but he still manages to talk her into dinner . 
whereas wright does a decent english accent , her talents pretty much end there . 
on the other side of the wall , dobie's troubled past is succinctly summarized in a scene in which he thumbs through an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like " actor delivers a stunning macbeth , " actor courted by hollywood studio , " " actor renounces hollywood for priesthood , " and " prostitute fingers priest in sex scandal . " 
the film's plot could have been just as easily condensed . 
 " artist moves in next door to shakespearean psychopath . " 
 " yawns ensue . " 
so dobie rants and raves and sarah chips away at large blocks of granite till way past their bedtimes . 
late in the film , their paths finally cross with mind-numbing results . 
nobody else in the apartment complex appears to mind all the racket , but one old dear does go ballistic when sarah's bathtub overflows . 
no , we don't see wright in the tub ( or fahey for that matter ) , and the gore quotient is virtually nil , so for a horror film " the sculptress " is surprisingly lacking . 
the only thing worth looking at is san francisco , and writer/director ian merrick manages to make even it look dreary , windswept , and deserted . 
 " the sculptress " isn't even bad enough to be fun . 
luckily , a limited release has made it easy to avoid . 

   i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard . 
the problem is , i can't remember them as i write this review . 
that's not a good sign . 
in booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can't really describe , because i don't know that much about him . 
i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he doesn't like relationships , just " booty calls " at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment ) . 
bunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz's direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long-term commitment ( a whole seven weeks , wow ! ) . 
rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it's going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki's friend lysterine ( vivica a . fox ) , who have never met . 
to make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki's obsession with safe sex . 
first she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them . 
oh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin . 
back to the store . 
now they've got to get dental dams , or there'll be no foreplay . 
why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ? 
nikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she'd better be making these demands , too . 
talk about coitus interruptus . 
booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies . 
the difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality . 
in this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane ! 
at the extreme . 
there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention . 
it is disappointing , and even worse , distracting . 
there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? ) 
does not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing . 
for instance , there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant . 
bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese , much to everyone's surprise . 
however , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films , and soon gained mastery . 
this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene . 
if , on the other hand , when asked how he learned to speak chinese , bunz simply replied with , " kung-fu movies , " and then moved on , the joke would have been much more effective . 
this is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable . 
by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit . 
the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions . 
why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ? 
why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ? 
if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex , why doesn't she have some condoms at her own apartment ? 
these questions are not answered by the screenplay , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward . 
a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language . 
some movies use a lot of swear words , but use them under very justifiable circumstances , as when they are employed consistent with a character's pattern of speech . 
other films , such as the recent jackie brown , use them in ways that almost parody themselves . 
booty call just sticks them in to get laughs , and it doesn't work . 
they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them . 
half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason . 
the chinese restaurant , a holdup at a convenience store , and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story , and are in there for filler . 
this is surprising , considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long . 
it's too bad that the core of the film isn't much better , since it is comprised of sometimes funny , but forgettable dialog . 
i refer you to the first paragraph of this review . 

   retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year . 
earlier this may , leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on cbs . 
and now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies . 
starring milla jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch , `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend . 
besson ( who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `the fifth element' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife jovovich , because in `the messenger' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience . 
at first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber . 
after seeing the rousing trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - milla jovovich looked superb . 
with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , `the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making . 
a timeless epic it is not . 
besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style , and the story behind `the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands . 
on the shoulders of besson's choppy and unexciting direction , the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery . 
there is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne ) . 
jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective . 
jovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard . 
she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast . 
jovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she looks lost . 
quite frankly , i don't know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger' without a major fumble . 
the script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy , as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii ( john malkovich ) and informs him of her heavenly intentions . 
faye dunaway plays charles' overbearing mother-in-law , and dustin hoffman appears over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed ? the conscience' . 
all three actors juggle limited screen time , although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful . 
the battle scenes are extremely bloody , but with the presence of such jittery camera work , they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like `braveheart' . 
there's a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on , when jeanne ( as a young girl ) watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier . 
even his fellow troopers are petrified . 
`the messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story . 
almost too 90's , it seems . 
there's gratuitous use of the f-word and a barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts ! ' 
sprinkled throughout the screenplay . 
i was half-expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it never happened . 
there's also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor , but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly . 
it seems terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `the messenger' , almost everything does . 
the musical score by erric serra is spectacular , and the set and production designs are continuously impressive . 
if it was visual excellence that besson was striving for , then he achieves his goal . 
but the only time the dramatics come alive in `the messenger' is during the closing trial , in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake . 
during these moments , the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience , albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning . 
it's just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation , in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects . 
`the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf . 
anyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film . 
despite my original hopefulness , milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy . 

   in china in 1982 i turned the tables on our national guide and asked him if he had any questions about america . 
i guess i was expecting some sort of political question . 
instead , i was dumfounded by what was most on his mind . 
 " in america , do wives and their mothers-in-law get along well ? " 
he assured me in china that they did , but i am certain if that were true he would not have asked . 
even in china people seem to have problems relating to in- laws . 
perhaps some of life's most difficult relationships arise when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage . 
a man trying to relate to his new prospective in-laws and vice-versa could be the basis of a very strong comedy . 
meet the parents does not demonstrate that fact , however . 
greg focker ( played by ben stiller ) has been dating and in love with pam byrnes ( teri polo ) for ten months and is now ready to propose to her . 
he will do it during a weekend visit to meet debbie's family and to attend her sister's wedding . 
from the beginning the relationship is awkward between greg and jack and dina byrnes ( robert deniro and blythe danner ) . 
through no fault of his own , the airline has lost greg's luggage . 
and he has to ask to borrow clothing . 
it is the beginning of a game of one-upmanship in which greg is nearly always one-down . 
as the games go on greg is more and more uncomfortable and uneasy which only contributes to the mistakes he makes . 
greg is playing a game he does not understand , in a league he is new to . 
but perhaps along the way he will discover some unexpected secrets about his father-in-law . 
this film had potential in its tale of one-upmanship . 
it has hit on a situation that many in the audience may find familiar--one that has not been done overly frequently in films . 
but the script by jim herzfeld and john hamburg is a little too contrived . 
too many coincidences in the story work against greg . 
the script could not decide if the main character was incompetent or simply unlucky . 
certainly he does not help his situation by doing everything wrong he possibly could , but even when he is trying to do the right things nature conspires against him . 
there is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy . 
certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written . 
the main reason to see meet the parents is to see robert deniro's performance . 
deniro plays the suspicious and not a little fascistic father as tightly wound and threatening as he can . 
the little judgmental expressions on his face are a show in themselves as greg digs himself deeper and deeper into his insecurities . 
but we do not really see much of that digging . 
ben stiller is an affable presence in the film but is not really stretching himself by playing the role as the nebbish to whom so many bad things happen . 
it is nice to see blythe danner again on the screen . 
but her character has a basic conflict between a basic decency and her love for her husband and the script should have given her more to do with that . 
randy newman has written a playful score . 
in the first few seconds of the film it does something creative i have never heard a film score do before . 
there is a lot of source music that is popular music of the 1960s . 
presumably that is what the upper class listens to at least in somebody's imagination . 
humor is subjective and some this film has been getting some favorable comment . 
but this is a comedy that works only occasionally for me . 
i would have to rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 

   how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres ? 
isn't there a law or something ? 
this diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg's dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst . 
mouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat-out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison . 
writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill . 
the plot , for what its worth , concerns two brothers ( nathan lane and an appalling lee evens ) who inherit a poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father . 
deciding to check out the long-abandoned house , they soon learn that it's worth a fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder . 
but battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse , happy with his run-down little abode and wanting it to stay that way . 
the story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe . 
whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue , terrible overacting , and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury , signifying nothing . 
the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is : " i hate that mouse " . 
oh cringe ! 
this is home alone all over again , and ten times worse . 
one touching scene early on is worth mentioning . 
we follow the mouse through a maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift abode somewhere in a wall . 
he jumps into a tiny bed , pulls up a makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep , seemingly happy and just wanting to be left alone . 
it's a magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film . 
a message to speilberg : if you want dreamworks to be associated with some kind of artistic credibility , then either give all concerned in mouse hunt a swift kick up the arse or hire yourself some decent writers and directors . 
this kind of rubbish will just not do at all . 

   i have a great idea for a movie , one that can't miss . 
see , i've got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack , and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances . 
it's about professional basketball , so i'll release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity . 
as for what the movie is actually about . . . well , that will all sort itself out eventually . 
i figure it will be a comedy , so i'll throw a half-dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with . 
maybe we'll put a gender spin on it , see if we can get some women out to see it , too . 
eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind . 
twister , as inane as the script might have been , at least required some creative technicians ; mission : impossible , overwrought plot and all , at least involved genuine effort . 
eddie just sits there , hawking up a formula story without any laughs , and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required . 
whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin , a new york limo driver and die-hard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team . 
coach john bailey ( dennis farina ) has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas , and the losses are beginning to mount . 
the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess ( frank langella ) to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team . 
the winner ( surprise , surprise ) is eddie , who becomes a fan favorite , and eventually the actual coach . 
the knicks continue to lose , but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops . 
incidentally , the knicks eventually start winning . 
please raise your hand if that comes as a shock , and i will invite you to my all-night marathon of the bad news bears , major league , angels in the outfield , the mighty ducks , the big green , cool runnings and little giants . 
awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds ; it's what they do . 
those teams usually involve kids , for a very sound comedic reason : it's funnier when they screw up , and they're more sympathetic . 
those which _don't_ involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles , for another very sound comedic reason : they generally have developed some sort of comic timing . 
eddie was cast under the misguided premise that it's easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players . 
this finds nba players like greg ostertag , dwayne schintzius , rick fox and malik sealy delivering punch lines as though they were reading them for the first time off a bazooka wrapper ( though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players ) . 
perhaps that all didn't matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines , and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick . 
steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming , " don't blame me , i just work here . " 
perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn't a movie -- it's a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while . 
among the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump , new york mayor rudolph giulianni , former new york mayor ed koch , david letterman , letterman regulars mujibur rahman and sirajul islam , espn broadcaster chris berman and knicks announcer marv albert , as well as dozens of nba players and several nba arenas . 
and those are the real jokes in eddie . 
nothing these individuals say or do is funny ; you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice , " hey , it's donald trump ! " 
or " hey , it's mujibur and sirajul ! " 
it's difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can't even get the cliches in a cliche-ridden genre script right . 
the knicks coach who is eddie's antagonist early in the film reappears at the end , but he isn't given a chance to be the villain eddie desperately needs . 
neither is frank langella , and none of the athlete-actors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of . 
that leaves her to do her street-wise miss thang routine , but with no character , no sharp lines and no help . 
eddie isn't just a bad movie with a formulaic premise . 
it's a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended , because someone came up with a poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie , and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy . 

   at one point in this movie there is a staging of an opera that goes completely wrong . 
but one member of the crowd stands up and cheers , thinking the performance was planned , and applauding it for their efforts . 
that's " dirty work " in a nutshell . 
a very different kind of movie . 
this is not a movie that i can easily review . 
the critic in me analyzes the structure , plot , acting , characters . 
 . 
 . and 
tells me this movie is terrible . 
but the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing . 
this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than a movie . 
it's a one note concept . 
mitch and sam need $50000 in order to bribe a doctor to give their father a heart transplant before other more needy patients . 
realizing they are very good at revenge plots , they open a revenge for hire business , eventually running afoul of a rich businessman played by christopher macdonald ( who after roles in " happy gilmore " and " veronica's closet " seems typcast in this role ) , who sends them to destroy a building that mitch learns is the home of his girlfriend's grandmother , thus leading them to plot against the rich businessman on the night of the grand opening of a new opera house . 
first the critic in me . 
the plot is the standard poor guy vs evil rich guy device , where the main character meets the girl of his dreams along the way . 
here's the catch . 
none of the characters are sympathetic . 
they're all selfish jerks who don't care who they hurt in their attempts to do whatever they want . 
the jokes are juvenile , crude , appealing to the worst elements in people . 
there's jokes about prostitutes , the homeless , beastiality , anal sex . 
there's even a subplot that's developed , it seems , only to make jokes about infidelity and incest . 
and i loved watching it . 
i was a huge fan of norm macdonald's sarcastic , to-the-point comedy on saturday night live , and this movie is an hour and a half of it . 
norm macdonald takes a joke , strips it to the core , and tells it like it is with a dry wit . 
like the scene were he and his friend are learning the ropes at a new construction job . 
the foreman goes over the basics , which mitch and sam don't understand . 
how do they get out of it ? 
by admiting they lied on their resumes , and don't know a thing about construction ! 
and surprise , they get fired . 
the characters are incredibly mean-spirited . 
there's a father who's loud and obnoxious , a gambling addicted doctor played by chevy chase who tells sam of his father's condition by saying " if i were a gambling man i'd put a lot of money on death . " 
the businessman cole who always has his dog spunky , and does who knows what with it . 
and then there's mitch and sam , who , thinking they can get $50000 by destroying a building , ponder how their actions would ruin the lives of the residents . 
 " too bad we have to do it , " mitch says . 
here's a movie where every joke that is executed as it is set up , where you see every punchline coming , where every spot profanity could be used and then is used . 
at least the film is honest , and makes no mistake that it is anything more than idiotic . 
but at least it isn't dull , and it isn't predictable . 
and that's the way it should be . 
it's sketch comedy , and if you're a fan of norm macdonald , you'll love it . 
the jokes are crude , the characters are mean to the core , the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn't care . 
if you don't like norm macdonald , or stupid movies , then you probably won't like this one . 
the jokes are crude , the characters are mean to the core , the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn't care . 
so before seeing this one , tune your mindset , and prepare for a slew of norm macdonald humor , gay animal sex , prison rape jokes , uncaring characters , and one last performance from chris farley . 
the critic in me says ( * ) but i give it an 8 ( * * * ) . 
i just couldn't stop laughing . 

   to sum the entire film " 54 " up in one sentence , it would be : watch a vh1 documentary instead . 
 " 54 " , seems like someone brought william faulkner into 1978 , brought him into studio 54 , got him really drunk , told him to write about it , and then dumbed that down to be released to the public . 
a sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex , drugs , and disco . 
the narrator , shane o'shae ( ryan phillippe ) , works as a grease monkey in new jersey who , of course , on a whim decides to go into new york and try to get into studio " 54 " . 
phillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by any young , attractive actor with a six pack stomach . 
he is let in by steve rubbell ( mike myers ) , the infamous co-owner of studio 54 , because he is attractive . 
he eventually becomes a bus boy and then a bartender . 
 . 
 . 
you expected more , didn't you . 
there isn't . 
the film builds up from nothing and becomes nothing as it's climax ( isn't that an apt word for studio 54 ) lands with a thud . 
the glitz of the club and perpetually semi-clothed patrons are used in an to attempt to show the it's glamour . 
for much of its target audience , college age to early thirties , it attempts to show celebrities mixing with " normal people . " 
this even fails since the only two celebs truly introduced are andy warhol and truman capote . 
you can be sure that half of the audience hasn't heard of them , another quarter only know their names , and the other quarter knew they were there already . 
the humor , if you can call it that , is built on an eighty year old woman getting high and 70s references like john travolta and olivia newton john making us laugh at how stupid we were back then 
the best performance in the film is given by mike myers as the perpetually high , sexually ambivlaent , very new york steve rubell . 
he seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive . 
he looks like rubell and sounds just like him while giving a subdued , almost nostalgic performance , when needed . 
it reminds you of his saturday night live character linda richmond on " coffee talk " sans dress and wig . 
the supporting cast of salma hayek , breckin meyer , and neve cambell are their only there to give added subplots which are introduced but lead absolutely nowhere . 
the romance between phillippe and cambell , as a soap opera star , is completely implausable . 
the two share about half as much screen time as there are shots of the eighty year old hooked on amphetimenes . 
hayek's wanna-be singer seems extremely forced and her husband , greg ( meyer ) stands in as shane o'shae's surrogate best friend . 
the subplots seemed forced and seem like they have been added just to make sure the film was over an hour and a half long . 
overall , " 54 " tried to give a view of the brashness of the place where crack flowed like heroin which flowed like wine . 
the film never leads to anything , has no obserable point , and covers up a lack of real plot with a veil of beautiful people . 
in truth , that reminded me of the eighies . 

   if the 70's nostalgia didn't make you feel old , the 80's nostalgia is bound to . 
one of the latter set , " the wedding singer , " seems to be written by someone who did not experience the 1980's directly but only read about them in an article in parade magazine . 
the wacky fashions are here . 
 . 
 . 
and the music . 
 . 
 . 
and references aplenty to celebrities and signs of the times , but it all seems tediously-and too obviously-inserted for the didn't-we-dress-funny-back-then chuckle . 
the plot is standard romantic comedy with nothing original : robbie ( adam sandler ) is a wedding singer ; julia ( drew barrymore ) waits tables at weddings . 
both are engaged ; however , robbie's fiance ( angela featherstone ) dumps him at the altar , and julia's fiance ( matthew glave ) is a skirt-chasing speculator in junk bonds . 
robbie and julia go through the expected ups-and-downs as they realize they were meant to be together . 
i'll fess up-i've never found adam sandler funny . 
whatever his appeal is , i've missed it . 
 ( other comedians i don't get include pauly shore and pee wee herman-make your own judgments ) . 
the stupidity and artificiality of the whole project is summarized in a cameo by billy idol as himself . 
idol looks like hell , and the ravages of his lifestyle are barely concealed by thick makeup . 
he's mocked by a photo of his younger self on a rolling stone cover in the same scene . 
we're not supposed to notice that , and we're not supposed to notice how silly it is that billy idol suddenly appears to play fairy godmother to robbie . 
other cameos , by steve buscemi and jon lovitz , provide the only real laughs in the movie . 
lovitz is especially good , playing a rival wedding singer plotting with the mania of a bond villain to take advantage of robbie's post-break-up depression . 

   you don't look at a ren ? magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning . 
you likewise don't look at one for 88 minutes straight . 
surrealist works are notable for their quirks , and they are fun , but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting . 
that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died , a surrealistic , hyperactive comedy with no dialogue . 
it's not a silent movie ; there is lots of atmospheric music , occasional screams and weird sound effects , but nobody ever utters an audible word . 
though the film is distinctive , its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes , and as it progressed , watching became a chore . 
the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo-legendary ed wood , the man behind such " classics " as plan 9 >from outer space and night of the ghouls . 
the joke , of course , is that his films are so bad , they're good ; so humorous in their inanity that they become hits . 
i woke up early the day i died , unfortunatly , is so bad that it's really bad . 
it stars billy zane ( titanic ) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse , escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around , stealing a car , clothes , and a load of money . 
our thief reaches a cemetery , where he witnesses a bizarre ritual . 
he falls asleep and finds himself , literally , in a hole , with his money gone . 
for whatever reason , he is bent on getting his hard-unearned cash back ( considering how easily he stole it the first time , why didn't he just go steal some more ? ) . 
he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they don't have what he is looking for . 
i don't think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short . 
the subject and the style seem to have been made for it . 
unfortunately , twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length , and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome . 
it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on , up to the point where halfway through i was already weary . 
it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious ; but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is . 
i woke up early the day i died is a comedy , i guess , though it could have fooled me . 
unlike most ed wood films , this one tries to be funny and fails , instead of the other way around . 
there's nothing inherently wrong with that , in fact , i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so " good " at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one . 
whether wood actually went for comedy in his script we'll never know , but in either case , this is a failure . 
jonathan taylor thomas , christina ricci , summer phoenix , john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos . 
ricci , for example , plays a prostitute . 
her role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out . 
thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff . 
was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work ? 
zane , meanwhile , occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up . 
lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature . 
the carnival side-show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this no-budget production . 
it's desperately unfunny , but thinks it's the funniest thing since plan 9 ; , it's so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction . 
i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting send-off .

   an 18-foot-high , 43-foot-long dragon is the computer-generated co- star of this strictly-by-the-numbers sword 'n' sorcery flick . 
as voiced by sean connery , " draco " is a surprisingly expressive creation who is well-deserving of his 23 minutes of screen time . 
he walks , talks , flies , fries , and even fakes his own death , all with the help of 96 computer-aided animators . 
too bad that ilm ( industrial light and magic ) couldn't spare some special effects for dragonheart's * human * co-stars . 
a bearded black hole exists where dennis quaid should be . 
he's a near-total loss as he growls glumly through his role of a disillusioned knight . 
david thewlis' evil king has a high hiss factor ( hf ) , though he's more of a mumbling oddity than anything else . 
oh , and there's some redhead in a '90's wig , who runs around either screaming or scowling , depending upon if the particular scene has her playing the woman in peril or the put upon peasant . 
the fringe flourishes include pete postlethwaite as a wandering monk with literary ambitions , julie christie ( ! ) as the good queen mother , a band of mercenaries that appear dressed for ye olde heavy-metal concert , and , believe or it not , the speaking spirit of king arthur . 
bring out your dead ! 
unfortunately , when we add it all together ( draco + fringe bits - quaid - thewlis ) , the sum total amounts to zero . 
dragonheart is , well , too much of too little . 
director rob cohen ( dragon : the bruce lee story ) has made a big , expensive movie that , while ambitiously plotted , is both murky and predictable . 
and overscored . 
and self-important . 
and the list goes on . 
 ( i must ask : did screenwriter charles edward pogue intend that * every * character be stabbed , lanced , or sliced at least once ? 
keep that man away from the knife drawer ! ) 
the last five minutes of this movie are the worst , with some silly celestial nonsense that would be laughed out of any planetarium light show , much less a summer movie . 
save your money . 

   this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground , despite some good performances from a basically competent cast . 
eddie ( sean penn ) and maureen ( robin wright penn ) are a not-so-happily married couple down on their luck . 
living in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city , they spend what little income they have at the local bar , owned by shorty ( stanton ) , eddie's best friend , and his wife georgie ( mazar ) . 
maureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddie's frequent disappearances . 
on his return , he promises her the world and professes his undying love . 
their manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows , as eddie disappears again . 
like a junky craving the next high , maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high . 
their relationship is further complicated by maureen's pregnancy . 
she wants the baby and the father , but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter . 
during one of eddie's absences , maureen is attacked by kiefer , her neighbor , who gets her drunk ( with her cooperation ) and then insists on intimacy . 
she leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do -- not to her , but to kiefer . 
she lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage . 
he lashes out as she expects , and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months -- but in reality is 10 years . 
during this decade , maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual , joey ( travolta , in a small role ) . 
her life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her . 
joey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband ( and father of two children ) and stability ( joey makes a good living , drives a cadillac , and they live in a large house in the suburbs ) and the love of her previous life . 
she chooses her past , and sacrifices not only her new life but her old ( by giving up her and eddie's daughter to joey ) . 
but the eddie that she knew is gone , replaced by a mere shell of the man he was . 
maureen is herself a mere shell , more an automaton than a woman -- as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him . 
perhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness ( or maybe the lack of sadness ) together , but the movie's denouement was not convincing . 

   the general's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film . 
it's confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction . 
that , however , is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller . 
the punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general's daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense . 
our hero is warrant officer paul brenner , a brash investigator for the u . s . army's criminal investigation division . 
his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) at a georgia base , the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation . 
complicating the case is the fact that capt . campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) , a war hero and potential vice-presidential nominee . 
general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press , which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in . 
teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) -- who , coincidentally enough , once had a romantic relationship with brenner -- brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain's past that make the case ever more sordid . 
if only the sordidness were the worst of the general's daughter's problems . 
scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light sleaze . 
director simon west likely thinks he's covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film's fatal flaw . 
it's a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story's few virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them . 
characters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell's still-living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention spans . 
west just can't help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general's daughter . 
he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow-fade edits . 
bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell . 
the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell's mentor , a psychological warfare expert named moore ( james woods ) . 
there's something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another . 
indeed , travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures ( to the local sheriff of the georgia county : " shouldn't you be out night-sticking the colored folk ? " ) . 
even the lame device of brenner and sunhill's sexual history provides a few winning zingers . 
goldman's dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you'll find in most so-called comedies . 
dialogue , unfortunately , just isn't enough to make a quality script . 
it's difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner ( an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene ) and too lucky for it to last any longer ( not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye ) . 
by the time the general's daughter wanders towards its over-wrought , psycho-in-the-rain finale , west's heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun . 
it's silly and pretentious film-making , but at least it provides a giggle or five . 
goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand-up routine . 

   what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in real life ? 
you get martin lawrence in a coma ( the comedian thought he was getting fat , so he put on numerous layers of heavy clothing and went jogging in 100 degree heat , ending up in a coma ) . 
so what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in the movies ? 
you get an audience in a coma . 
in big momma's house , lawrence plays a fbi agent who's a master of disguises . 
when a naughty , naughty man escapes from jail and seeks out his former girlfriend ( the very sexy nia long . . . 
the only thing worth looking at in this movie ) , she flees to georgia to stay with her rather large southern aunt " big momma " ( ella mitchell ) . 
the fbi follows her in order to recover the large sum of money stolen in the bank robbery that sent the naughty man to jail . 
however , big momma is called away on an emergency . 
sensing that they could lose their only chance to capture the criminal , lawrence goes undercover as big momma . 
and let the comedy begin ! 
big momma's house is the definition of a " gimmick " movie if there ever was one . 
the plot can basically be summed up as " martin lawrence dresses up as a fat woman " . . . 
and even that description is too wordy . 
you can just see this script plotted out on a chalkboard with martin lawrence/fat woman in the middle of the board with a big circle around it , and all sorts of clich ? d , " humorous " situations pointing to it . 
fat woman plays basketball ! 
fat woman takes a dump ! 
fat woman kung fu ! 
well they left one off the board . . . 
movie critic slips into coma ! 
paul giamatti ( private parts , the negotiator ) plays lawrence's partner and as much as i enjoy his work , even he can't inject life into this lifeless comedy . 
hell , the greatest performers on the planet couldn't make this material work . . . 
it's just that awful . 

   blatantly borrowing elements from 1993's " like water for chocolate " and 1991's " the butcher's wife , " " simply irresistible " attempts to be a whimsical romantic comedy but , more often than not , comes off as laughable , leaving you to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar ( t . v . 's " buffy , the vampire slayer " ) would choose such an obviously inept film project to waste her time on . 
things get off to a bad start right from the onset as amanda ( sarah michelle gellar ) , a young woman who runs her late family's struggling new york restaurant , runs into a mystery man who forces a bushel of crabs on her and then vansihes into thin air . 
while out shopping , she also meets tom ( sean patrick flanery ) , a charming , handsome man , who happens to be planning a ritzy restaurant for the department store he works for , and later when he decides to drop by her dive , called southern cross , for lunch , she somehow makes a delicious crab dish for him , even though she is known to not be a very good chef . 
suddenly , amanda finds her restaurant , on the edge of foreclosure , rejuvenate to life as customer begin to swarm for her food , which strangely causes everyone immediate jubilation when it hits their mouths . 
are amanda and tom destined to be together ? 
and is it not just because of the magical food , but because they really , truly like each other ? 
and what exactly is going on with the food she is making ? 
does it have anything to do with that pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in the kitchen somehow assisting her in her food preparation ? 
 " simply irresistible " is a ridiculous and just plain goofy romantic fantasy that's as flimsy as a slice of bologna . 
it takes one joke---that people who eat the food are taken aback by it in most unusual ways---and recycles it over and over again until the film has reached an appropriate running time of 95 minutes . 
add in a music montage every ten minutes ( these are actually the best scenes in the movie , which certainly tells you something about the film itself ) , and what you've got is an utterly empty , if not necessarily boring , excursion . 
the cast of " simply irresistible " is fairly good , but it is the supporting characters who are the most interesting . 
patricia clarkson ( 1998's " high art , " in which she played a drugged-out lesbian ) is a standout as tom's colleague , and is thankfully given a few funny lines of dialogue . 
also of note is larry gilliard jr . , as amanda's cooking assistant and buddy , who is allowed to create a seemingly full character out of only a handful of scenes . 
of the main stars , sarah michelle gellar is fine , but really does often look like she's struggling through the unmistakably clumsy material , and if sean patrick flanery plans on keeping a film career in the future , he has certainly got to pick better projects than this . 
the bottom line is that " simply irresistible " is the exact opposite of its deprophesized title , and when the movie got to the point where the characters began to float in mid-air ( an unamusing plot device that was repeated in the stupid last scene ) , my mind checked out from the characters and the romance . 
when i think about it in hindsight , i should have checked out in the very first scene , where the point of the action was for gellar to crawl under tables looking for a runaway mechanical crab . 
now , that certainly is what i'd call magical ! 

   in my opinion , a movie reviewer's most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion . 
but with soul survivors , i'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned . 
however , protocol forces me to do otherwise . 
soul survivors tells the story of four college-bound friends : cassandra ( melissa sagemiller ) is sweet and innocent . 
party girl annabel ( eliza dushku of bring it on ) is dating world-weary harvard student matt ( wes bentley ) . 
matt still has feelings for cassie , who is now dating sean ( casey affleck ) . 
driving back from a creepy , gothic party , the quartet gets into a horrific car crash . 
sean dies , leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty , made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her . 
as cassie mopes through her classes , she sees the ghost of sean all over the place , urging her to follow him . 
along with being plagued by other ghastly visions , cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party . 
annabel and matt try calming her down , but no one shares cass's visions . 
she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself . 
rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material . 
in his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion . 
when the movie's camerawork isn't pedestrian , it's clich ? d . 
carpenter's need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation . 
we already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? 
and the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here . 
carpenter's script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness . 
this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around . 
the second lamest device , of course , is the , " oh , it was all a dream " resolution . 
and guess what ? 
this movie has both ! 
not that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile . 
since there's no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere . 
that's a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples . 
carpenter can't even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it . 
[the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats .

when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts . 
and when sagemiller and dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint , they're fully clothed . 
regardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity . 
why wouldn't they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ? 
why would they shower in their clothes ? 
what if they weren't covered in latex paint ? 
the cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes . 
i felt sorry for affleck , who i've liked in other movies , and bentley , who was great in american beauty . 
dushku , who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality , has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan . 
as for sagemiller ( star of the aforementioned get over it ) , i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person , and not an object for gawking . 
and i'm not even getting into luke wilson's role as a priest . 
at least he's friends with wes anderson . 
bottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it . 

   8mm is not going to enlighten your day . 
it's a dark , grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence . 
not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess , you'll require a lot of patience as well . 
nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late . 
he wore a bizarre get-up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes , and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality . 
cage plays private investigator tom welles , praised for his secrecy and reliability . 
at home , welles is a family man , with a wife ( catherine keener ) and a small daughter to take care of . 
his new assignment is a bizarre one : the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husband's safe . 
the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man , until the girl is brutally murdered . 
or so it seems . 
welles , of course , begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth . 
and the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case , the more he gets in over his head . 
he hires an adult book store clerk named max california ( joaquin phoenix ) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography . 
max knows what welles is getting himself into , and explains , `you dance with the devil , the devil don't change . 
the devil changes you . ' 
these turn out to be very wise words . 
8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution . 
the set-up is slick and well played , as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her . 
this is where everything goes awry . 
although director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the `real world' , he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula . 
everything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless , repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects . 
although it had enormous potential , the third act of 8mm is a total bust , leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control . 
cage is the film's sole flame of energy . 
his performance is actually believable , but soon the director's demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation . 
still , you've got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did , for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand . 
welles' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker ( played convincingly by peter stormare ) who is notorious for the hardest-hitting snuff films in the industry . 
this is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killer-like phase , in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film . 
he tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing ( chris bauer ) , and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery , a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie . 
written by andrew kevin walker , 8mm dissipates into a poor man's seven , with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece . 
furthermore , what has become of joel schumacher ? 
the director has recently experienced a major drought , slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop ( batman and robin , anyone ? ) . 
this putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career , so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side . 

   the ads make " hanging up " seem like an upbeat comedy about a rascally father and his three daughters . 
anyone who went to the movie expecting that left disappointed . 
all of the movie's funny scenes were included in the ad . 
so what do we get ? 
eve marks ( meg ryan ) just put her father lou mozell ( walter matthau ) into a hospital . 
once upon a time , lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now-estranged wife . 
his one great moment in life was writing a film for john wayne , who gave him a giant bullet-shaped trophy . 
now lou is senile and deteriorating rapidly . 
eve tries to convince her sisters georgia ( diane keaton ) and maddy ( lisa kudrow ) that their father is dying and needs them . 
both are slow to show concern . 
so devoted eve stands vigil over her father , who constantly asks for his favorite daughter georgia , while running her own business ( planning special events ) and caring for her son ( jesse james ) . 
 ( some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st . bernard for eve to care for . ) 
the tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eve's events where georgia is the keynote speaker . 
there's a superficial resemblance to shakespeare's " king lear " ( senile king with three daughters : one devoted saint and two selfish bitches ) , but the material is apparently drawn from life . 
sister screenwriters delia and nora ephron had parents who were a successful hollywood writing team . 
henry and phoebe ephron collaborated on 17 screenplays , including " desk set " and " there's no business like show business . " 
 ( delia's novel , the basis for the film , is dedicated to henry ) . 
surprisingly , the script is as thin as an anorexic's wet dream . 
the virtue of a semi-autobiographical project would seem to be the wealth of material available . 
yet , the ephrons provide only the barest minimum of information about their characters . 
also , the spaces they inhabit seem artificial . 
eve lives in a house that looks like a magazine layout ; no matter how put-upon she is , we can't feel sorry for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day . 
georgia is a famous magazine editor , and in her brief scenes while she chats on a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for a profile . 
when we first meet maddy , she's fishing at a picturesque mountain stream . 
i expected to see the credit " cinematography by 'vanity fair . ' " 
and , yes , diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrow's mother . 
to her credit , though , she looks young enough to pull it off . 
the one redeeming aspect of " hanging up " is that , at its core , is a truth about siblings . 
there's always one on which everyone else in the family relies , freeing the others to be selfish and emotionally distant . 
my wife is the reliable child in her family ; for better or worse , my brother has the role in mine . 
 ( being selfish and emotionally distant may not be fulfilling , but it is a lot less work ) . 
if you have nothing better to do than watch this movie , look for a powerful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters' mother pat . 
in a devastating scene , eve discovers that her mother doesn't love her . 
although leachman is best known for comedies like " young frankenstein " and " the mary tyler moore show , " her performance here reminded me of the considerable dramatic talent she displayed in " the last picture show . " 
bottom line : everyone involved has lived in hollywood so long they don't recognize real life anymore . 

   this was the last carry on movie ( if you discount 'carry on columbus' as a carry on movie ) and was made by a new production company . 
based in central london , this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert ( suzanne danielle ) to bed her husband emile the french ambassador ( kenneth williams ) . 
when he seems unwilling , she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes , such as the prime minister and the u . s . ambassador . 
her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages . 
she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead . 
meanwhile , theodore valentine ( larry dann ) is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her . 
however , she is only interested in restoring her husband's ardour which seems a little difficult after emile's accident with a church spire ! 
this film is the second worst carry on movie , the worst being 'carry on england' . 
it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written . 
newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid ( as mrs . valentine ) are mildly funny , but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad . 
kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted , given the script . 
the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler , joan sims as mrs . dangle , kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur , and peter butterworth as richmond , are worthless and embarassing . 
in fact , all four parts are surplus to requirements . 
however , the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades . 
an awful script , a terrible collection of jokes , very poor production values ( especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st . james palace ) , a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score , and a non-existent plot or storyline . 
its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next ! 
jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring , joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted , and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile . 
a complete waste of time , this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies . 
it was a certificate 15 film but by 1978 , there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998 ! 
avoid at all costs ! 

   the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities . 
the best tales of the genre deal with mankind's struggle for survival or knowledge . 
such popular and noteworthy tomes as " stranger in a strange land " by robert heinlein , " childhood's end " by arthur c . clarke and " man in the high castle " and " do androids dream of electric sheep " by philip k . dick all deal with man's need for identity and struggle for self worth . 
hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it's beginnings . 
most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved . 
it really wasn't until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein's novel " rocketship galileo " and crafted the film " destination moon " , that 'sci-fi' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it's own . 
from there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre . 
with the release of touchstone pictures " mission to mars " , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe . 
the film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission . 
woody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son . 
entering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) . 
luc consoles jim with woody's assistance . 
the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them . 
but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet . 
the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars . 
they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface . 
going out to investigate , luc and his team approach the famed 'face on mars' . 
a strange noise emanates from the rock . 
as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar , a violent wind storm erupts , creating a vortex that kills all members of the team , save for luc . 
back on the space station orbiting earth , woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing . 
luc's interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team . 
the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger . 
meteorite showers , explosions , and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet's surface . 
the big question is , is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars . 
and if so , what is its relationship with us ? 
now for the bad news . 
the entire plot of " mission to mars " is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe . 
the famed 'face on mars' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed . 
borrowing ideas from such films as " robinson crusoe on mars " ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , " 2001 : a space odyssey " , and even mario bava's " planet of the vampires " ( 'terrore nello spazio' ) ( 1965 ) , " mission to mars " is a hodgepodge of ideas that don't add up to a satisfying whole . 
while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un-involving . 
so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use . 
the performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry . 
gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation . 
and the mistaken idea of having jerry o'connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse . 
and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better . 
he's just having too much fun here to give a damn . 
the script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage . 
this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship . 
also , when one character sacrifices himself , the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation . 
but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid , intrusive score by ennio morricone . 
subtlety is non-existent here . 
in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out . 
the only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower . 
the pacing of the film is very leisurely . 
after the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes ) , we are finally dropped onto the martian surface . 
then , there is another long pause in the plot for more character development , including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity . 
the film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum . 
there are so many scenes of talking heads , discussing what we already know is going to happen , that it drags the film to a dead stop . 
the good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at . 
the vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring . 
the design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted , with a level of realism that hasn't been seen since " 2001 : a space odyssey " . 
the visual effects are just stunning , from the space walk sequences , to the visualization of evolution on earth . 
the only fault come with the martians themselves , which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world . 
director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film . 
the opening sequence alone in a seemingly un-interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes ( an homage' to hitchcock's " rope " ) , as we are introduced to all of the characters . 
scenes in the rescue ship , with its rotating centrifuge , are just amazing in their execution . 
but the nagging question , is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang . 
sadly it is not . 
director brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production . 
the set design and visual effects are all arresting . 
but it's the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous , thought provoking science fiction . 
a disappointing film , but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals . 

   for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them . 
sadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver . 
and not a particularly good one at that . 
what went wrong ? 
mi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it'll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise's firing gun just so they can die really cool . 
early on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic . 
in one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other's eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff . 
prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another . 
why ? 
i haven't the foggiest . 
i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply . 
with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects . 
it's possible that these " spies " could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored . 
the scenes i've described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character . 
god forbid . 
woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals . 
still in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish . 
cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) . 
between the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact . 
the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us . 
sure it's all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product . 
thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that's about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight . 
they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres . 
newton bats her eyes flirtatiously . 
cruise grins a little too slyly . 
the cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film . 
here cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 . 
he's cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90's ) . 
sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise's initial " i'm the man ! " 
charm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug . 
mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won't stop . 
the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could've been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the " symbolic " pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) . 
we've all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand . 
it isn't done any differently here . 
the action is pure hard target \ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind . 
he's cool for sure but he's made to be as empty as the movie . 
the actor isn't used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one . 
when he's not beaming away , he's staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo's editing seriously undermines the effort . 
he fetishizes cruise's angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof . 
i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he's really austin powers . 
in a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death . 
the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) . 
the lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles . 
though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment , the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug , only to fly about a hundred feet ( still in bear hug position ) , land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a " so you thought i was dead . . . " . 
not to worry , cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat . 
what a hero ! 
you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2's plot . 
my reasoning is simple : i'm not sure of any good it would do . 
the film itself has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next " special " effect . 
i wasn't kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video . 
nobody will go to this for the plot , and if they do they'll surely regret it . 
as summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing . 
in mi , the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma's ( that film's director ) stylistic flourishes , while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo's non-stop masturbatory pandemonium . 
it's irrelevant in every sense , as is character . 
all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors . 

   if i were to plot a graph of year against movie-plot-ridiculity for = hollywood movies , you'll probably see a line with constant gradient .

   an american werewolf in london is john landis' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england . 
the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects . 
more specifically , the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character . 
even twenty years after its release , that part of the movie is still impressive . 
although , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive . 
the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure . 
if it weren't for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 . 
and with good reason -- the acting isn't great and neither is the writing . 
well ok , we don't actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film . 
but one other important element is lacking here too -- it isn't scary . 
with no exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens . 
you don't even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint . 
i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen . 
but john , it just wasn't scary . 
i didn't know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it , but it didn't work for me . 
actually , it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films . 
but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me . 
it's never a good sign that you don't realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material . 
call me crazy , but you shouldn't have to do research on a movie to enjoy it . 
i'm not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up . 
werewolf bites boy ( david naughton ) . 
boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse ( jenny agutter ) and then strange things begin to happen to boy . 
including , and i must admit this is a very nice touch , visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital . 
the neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse . 
i know it sounds strange , but it actually works . 
the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy ( griffin dunne ) are really the best parts of the movie . 
as i said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects . 
while they are still impressive today , they aren't impressive enough , or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film . 
and since they are more or less the highlight of the film , there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch . 
actually , the 1998 sequel , an american werewolf in paris , is more entertaining since it doesn't take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way . 

   house on haunted hill ( 1999 ) starring taye diggs , geoffrey rush , ali larter , famke janssen , peter gallagher , bridgette wilson , max perlich , lisa loeb , james marsters , and chris kattan . 
directed by william malone , written by dick beebe , 
 " house on haunted hill " initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombie-like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible . 
one doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck . 
a nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water . 
these mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous b-horror flicks , with grunting noises and cadaverous movements . 
except this time , at the end of the millenium , the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be . 
in past horror films , the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims . 
 " house on haunted hill " doesn't want their audience to have an imagination , everything is provided for them to watch and squirm , not think . 
this nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film . 
 " house on haunted hill " , which is based on the 1958 film of the same title , introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can , following the opening blood fest . 
the film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot . 
the aim here is to scare the audience with chilling , unexpected shots of blood , guts , and mayhem . 
however , the film is neither scary nor unpredictable . 
the plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner ( geoffrey rush ) . 
each character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money . 
since the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring , the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them . 
the problem is that every character is not likable . 
the two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer ( taye diggs - who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent ) and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ( ali larter ) . 
the characters presented are so annoying and pathetic , that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them . 
the worst character in this film , or maybe in any film released this year , is chris kattan's watson pritchett . 
he spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate , that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself . 
waiting for pritchett to die , was a strenuously difficult act to sit through . 
the most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price ( an homage to victor price who starred in the original ) . 
playing the rich man who supposedly organized the party , he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face . 
however , rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing subplot involving a hateful marriage with evelyn price , played by famke janssen . 
the main problem is that " house on haunted hill " is not scary . 
to top off that huge disappointment , every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous . 
if the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped ( similar to " deep blue sea " ) , the goal for creating a creepy , suspenseful action film was completely missed . 

   the premise of this movie is , well , pretty far-fetched . 
tom berenger plays shale , a mercenary who is temporarily out of work ( those fools at the cia have denied his existence just because he and his buddies botched a job in cuba ) . 
fortunately , his girl friend ( diane venora ) , a teacher at christopher columbus high school in miami , gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student , creating a job opening for shale as a substitute teacher . 
not telling his girl friend , who might object on pedagogical grounds , he creates a number of fake higher degrees for himself ( from yale , harvard , princeton , et al ) and begins his tenure as a high school teacher . 
the students ( junkies , drug dealers , gang members , sleazy sluts , ice-pick wielders . . . you 
get the picture ) don't really take to him right away , so he hits one in the face with a can and breaks a few fingers . 
this gets their attention to a certain extent , so he tells them the story of the vietnam war : " see , some homeboys from the north tried to muscle in on the turf of the homeboys from the south . " 
oh yeah , now they can dig it ; the problem is just that nobody ever explained it properly before . 
but wait ! 
there are drugs being dealt in the school itself ! 
and behind the whole scheme , in cahoots with the head gang , the kod ( no , not " cod " , but " knights of destruction " . . . really ! ) , is none other than . . . the 
upright , ex-cop principal , played by the forgotten ghostbuster , ernie hudson ! 
so shale does what any good teacher would do . 
he gets his buddies together , they gather together a bunch of bazookas and other major weapons , explosives , and cool stuff like that , and they have a big showdown against the drug dealers and kod at the high school . 
ok , so the premise is not just far-fetched , it's downright dumb . 
if this were a hong kong action comedy , we might just accept it , but it takes itself far too seriously to be truly fun . 
oh , it has its moments ; how one can truly hate a movie in which huge ( really huge ) amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses ? 
and to be fair , it is almost never really boring , as the action is interrupted by only short sequences of actual story . 
but over all , this is pretty much a made-for-tv movie with more ( and bigger ) explosions and more foul language . 
in fact , it reminded me of " miami vice " without the production values , babes in skimpy bikinis , and pastels . 
if you can sneak into the theater without paying , go for it . 
otherwise , wait for video . 
the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . 
 * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
 * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 
 * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 
 * * * * * perfection . 
see it twice . 

   cashing in on the success of white men can't jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles ( including the cowboy way and drop zone ) , wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed , hoping that they can strike up the same success . 
sadly , if this dismal , cliche ridden and mind-numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by , they haven't got a chance in hell of even coming close . 
this time out , the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops . 
following several run-ins with their tyrannical boss ( robert blake ) , who is obsessed with the " money train " --a train which carries all the subway's takings--and will let nothing stop it ( now * there's * an original plot device ) , harrelson's character decides to try and take off with the cash . 
along the way , both of them fall in love with the same woman--another transit cop who also hates her boss . 
this leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in a film of this standard ( 'you were always the better brother' etc . etc . etc . ) , and doesn't help to add anything to the film . 
given a better script , better performers in supporting roles and a shorter running time ( the film almost went for two hours--or did it just feel like it ? ) , this film might ( and i mean * might * ) have turned out okay , but as it is , it is stocked with the worst action film cliches , whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time . 
robert blake , who plays the evil boss , has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film history ! 
he sounds like wayne newton , and appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as though they are about to burst out of their sockets ! 
but this is only one of money train's problems . 
if you look at the script as if it was an action film , it lacks originality and suspense . 
but if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film , it is even worse . 
the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised and the characters definitely ain't butch and sundance . 
the film isn't all bad though . 
snipes and harrelson , when they aren't using the dumb cliches that the script gives them , make an agreeable duo , and some of the stunt-work is indeed excellent . 
but good stunt-work cannot save a bottom-of-the-barrel action movie . 
if you're a really undemanding action freak , there's a chance you'll like this . 
but if you're looking for something original , or suspenseful , try somewhere else--i doubt you'll find it here . 

   girl 6 is , in a word , a mess . 
i was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film . 
there was no sense of where the film was going , or any kind of coherent narrative . 
if there was a point to the film , i missed it . 
girl 6 , by the way , is the way theresa randle's character is addressed in the phone sex workplace ; all the girls are known by their numbers . 
the plot , such as it is : theresa randle is a struggling n . y . actress , and eventually takes a job as a phone-sex operator . 
she begins to lose contact with reality , as her job consumes her . 
also , she must deal with the advances of her ex-husband ( isiah washington ) . 
he is an ex- con thief , and she tries to keep him away , while at the same time , it's clear that she still harbors feelings for him . 
her neighbor , jimmy ( spike lee ) functions as the observer ; mediating between the ex- husband and girl 6 . 
he also functions as a point of stability , as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex . 
the soundtrack , consisting of songs by prince , was jarring . 
it kept taking my attention from the film - not altogether a bad thing , i'll grant you , as what was transpiring onscreen wasn't that riveting . 
for parts of the middle of the film , the music stayed blissfully in the background . 
in the opening sequence and one scene later in the film , however , the music was particularly loud and distracting . 
of course , i've never really cared for prince's ( or tafkap if you like ) music . 
prince fans might love the soundtrack , but it will probably be distracting , even to die-hard fans . 
of the performances , the only one that stood out was spike lee's buddy character , jimmy . 
he was excellent as the always-broke neighbor of girl 6 . 
he should have stuck to acting in this film . 
there are several sequences that gave me the impression that he'd like to be oliver stone when he grows up . 
there are scenes shot with different types of film , which are purposely grainy , and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stone's natural born killers . 
in that film , they worked to propel the narrative . 
in this film , they just made me more confused . 
there are some amusing moments , and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phone-sex industry the multi-billion dollar industry that it has become . 
other than that , though , nothing much happens . 
there are a few intense moments , as when one caller becomes frightening , but even that is rather lackluster . 
i'm not the biggest fan of spike lee , though i'd agree that he has done some very good work in the past . 
in girl 6 , though , he seems to be floundering . 
he had an interesting idea , a fairly good setup , and seemed to wander aimlessly from there . 
girl 6 earns a grade of d . 

   long time buddies and neil diamond tribute band members wayne ( steve zahn , " happy , texas " ) and j . d . ( jack black , " high fidelity " ) watch in horror as third mate darren silverman ( jason biggs , " american pie " ) disappears under the thumb of his new fiance judith , ( amanda peet , " the whole nine yards " ) a controlling psychiatrist . 
they're doubly troubled when the return of darren's 'one and only love' sandy perkins ( amanda detmer , " final destination " ) returns to their home town but doesn't cause a ripple in darren's devotion to judith . 
there's only one thing wayne and j . d . can think of doing - they kidnap judith and fake her death in " saving silverman . " 
written by hank nelken and greg depaul after seeing a friend engaged to the wrong woman , " saving silverman " is directed by 'hit comedy director' dennis dugan of such films as " big daddy , " " brain donors " and " problem child . " 
it's a dismal , third-rate farrelly brothers rip off that attempts to milk humor from such inspired bits of whimsy as having darren's love interest come from a family of circus freaks and be about to become a nun . 
gross out gags include a visualization of darren getting butt cheek implants . 
 " saving silverman " is almost saved by stars zahn and black . 
these two are so comically talented they can take bad material and still deliver the goods . 
they're in " animal house " mode while the rest of the film trawls along and comes up empty . 
jason biggs can attribute his entire career to the luck of having been cast in the smash hit " american pie . " 
peet shows some physical moves but no flair for comedy here while detmer slaps a brave , sweet smile onto her face and soldiers through . 
r . lee ermey ( " full metal jacket " ) is one note in an embarrassing performance as a psychopathic ex-football coach . 
neil diamond appears at the film's climax as himself and miraculously enlivens the proceedings by belting out some of his old standards . 

   the general's daughter is a heartless , absurd film , a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters . 
director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity , creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo-depth . 
what's worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm . 
john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess , playing warrant officer paul brenner ; brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) . 
brenner is teamed up with ex-spouse sarah sunderland ( madeline stowe ) , and they check out all the suspects on the base , including elizabeth's mentor , colonel moore ( james woods ) . 
soon , it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff , but the question comes down to why -- and , of course , who . 
ebert's law of the economy of characters can be applied here ; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists ) , but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story . 
perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that , but it's painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something . 
on a story level , the general's daughter is ineptly constructed . 
the film , adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille's novel ( which was apparently based on a true story ) , plods along to its conclusion , filling in the blanks with stale , unrealistic dialogue and " shocking " plot developments . 
having not read the novel , it's difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author , but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree . 
scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman , brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue , which includes endless strings of forced lines . 
 ( sunderland actually asks brenner , " why was she killed ? " 
to which i would have answered , " if i knew , then the movie would already be over . " ) 
only after we've spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored . 
not that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot . 
in one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask . 
she sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring . 
instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner's houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap . 
this scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it's gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film's complete disregard for the characters and the audience . 
it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise . 
i realized that these constructs on screen aren't actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story . 
this would have been bad enough without the west's need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct . 
compelling films about sexual crimes don't spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don't show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture . 
these scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they're intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be . 
in addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it's a perversion of everything we know to be pure . 
this standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up . 
as it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane . 
perhaps the only positive elements in the general's daughter are a couple of the performances . 
james woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety . 
i also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous . 
nonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization . 
the general's daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut-outs force-feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one-sided moral judgments . 

   bruce willis needs to stay away from straightforward action pictures . 
mercury rising adds to a growing list ( including such stinkers as the jackal , last man standing , striking distance and the last boy scout ) of stale actioners he has headlined . 
and though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix , it is every bit as stale . 
art jeffries ( bruce willis ) is your typical tormented fbi agent . 
you know the type , haunted by his job , yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on the wrist . 
enter simon ( miko hughes ) , an autistic boy , who , like rain man and all other autistic people , is a savant . 
he can merely gaze at a super-encrypted message , and , while little computer beeps go off in his head , he can understand what it says . 
naturally , this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government . 
lt . col . nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) , an nsa official bubbling over with evil , has spent countless time and money implementing the newest " unbreakable " code , mercury . 
however , when two of his underlings ( robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman ) publish a mercury-encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test of its effectiveness , simon cracks the code . 
naturally , this infuriates kudrow , who sends a terminator-like hitman ( l . l . 
ginter ) to eliminate the security hazard . 
and that's where art jeffries comes in . 
for some reason that's never explained in the film , the fbi is called in to help , and through a series of intricate machinations , art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy . 
in a few unrealistic sequences , he enlists the aid of a stranger , stacey ( kim dickens ) , to help out , but she is given very little to do overall . 
the central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous . 
why bother trying to kill the kid . . . i 
mean , who would know ? 
it's not like the kid ( or anyone else for that matter ) knew he was cracking a government super-cypher . 
and even if he is eliminated , what does that help ? 
he's already proven that mercury can be broken . 
there's always the chance that someone else would crack it . . . but 
i guess without a kid in jeopardy , there's not much of a movie here . 
for all its faults , the film actually starts relatively well ( once you pass the painfully familiar teaser ) . 
the film flirts with developing real characters , and a semblance of a plot . . . then 
mr . terminator the hitman appears and everything begins going downhill . . . quickly . 
miko hughes does a decent job , for his age , at creating a touching performance . 
however , don't go to this film looking for any new insights into autism ( not that many people will ) . 
instead he merely becomes the latest unique partner in a routine buddy-cop movie ( think cop and a half . . . with a twist ! ) 
willis and baldwin are just overplaying to type . 
rather than creating a nuanced character , baldwin simply oozes sliminess . 
and for willis' part , he simply recycles the stock role of the loner cop/fbi agent ( which he has honed in the die hard series ) . 
as almost an afterthought , about halfway through , the film carelessly gives him a character trait ( an addiction ) , and then drops it in the next scene . 
but the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay . 
this film wasn't well thought out at all . 
the film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many convenient coincidences as possible . 
the carbon paper scene alone is unworthy of the most gullible audience member . 
at first the bad scenes just trickle in , but by the gruesomely bad finale they're a veritable flood . 
the film's few decent moments come in the form of bad jokes ( mainly from the geeks who developed the supercode ) . 
but they're not nearly enough to make the film worthwhile . 
mercury rising is a thriller that you're more likely to groan at than cheer . 

   jet li busted onto the american action movie scene , when he stole the show in 1998's lethal weapon 4 , with his wicked looks , his nasty moves and his undeniable charisma . 
it only took another two years for mega-producer joel silver to set him up in an all-american movie , primed to take over some of the empty action-hero seats left by alleged coke-head van damme and that pudgy guy named steven seagal . 
would this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts , namely chow yun-fat and jackie chan ? 
let's find out . 
plot : rival chinese and black gangster organizations fall further out of favor from one another , when members of their respective families start turning up dead . 
that's when badass jet li blasts into the picture to find out who the men were behind his brother's death and to exact some of his own style of revenge . 
critique : three words : not enough action ! 
simple enough ? 
not enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay , bad actors , crappy dialogue and oh-so many over-the-top melodramatic moments . 
and a romance angle ? 
why , one must ask . . . why ? 
i love fight scenes and i really dig jet li too , but this little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences , and jet , well , the poor dude was barely in the movie . 
and i thought this was supposed to be his big break ? 
how 'bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his kung-fu fighting chops , slap him in a few more scenes , and give him more chances to practice his acting/english abilities ? 
what a letdown . 
even black mask was more entertaining than this glossed up , empty shell of a film . 
in fact , i am sure that more time was spent gathering the " hits " for the soundtrack of this film , than were on the so-called " screenplay " . 
i felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time . 
the sad part about the bad script is that it wouldn't matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines . 
but no , save lindo and aaliyah , who weren't too shabby , i thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their inability to deliver lines convincingly . 
and what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deal run by some 15-year old looking guy , acting like he's the overlord of a drug ring ? ! 
what a mess . 
then again , i don't want it to seem like i'm complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable , since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway , not the story . 
well , i guess that's what disappointed me the most out of this film . 
there were a couple of cool fight scenes with li , but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving . 
also , as much as i love the way they incorporate wires and special effects in some of their stunts , a couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too obvious a stunt . 
it should be seamless , fellas , not necessarily against the laws of gravity ! 
the one cool thing that was original in the movie was the way in which the director showed us some of the inside cracklings of the human body when penetrated by a blow , but that simple creative touch couldn't save the rest of this film's uninteresting plot movements . 
i'm disappointed for jet li that this film didn't give him the real opportunity to star in a good story with many great action scenes . 
hopefully , the next time will be a charm for this charismatic actor . 
for now , i just hope that for his sake , the film's title isn't a premonition of the movie's ultimate fate at the box-office . 

   it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire . 
usually , you had to be an aristocrat - a count such as dracula or karnstein . 
to qualify , you'd have to have a modicum of sophistication , so you'd at least look cool - or suave - when biting into some young damsel's throat . 
but today , in our overly politically correct world , any scuzzy-looking , long-haired , unshaven lout or any spiked-haired harridans can put the bite on you . 
by the same token , to be a vampire hunter , one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier , or at least one who retired with honors . 
not in these times . 
all you need are some sharp weapons , some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy - or a blade . 
without sounding elitist , the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity . 
which brings us to blade , the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which , it seems , half the population is putting the bite on the other half . 
not only are there thousands of vampires , but they seem to move from city to city , pay off police departments and , most importantly , establish their own exclusive after-hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower . 
with all that blood , you wonder why they have to hunt for victims . 
you also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry-cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains . 
blade , which is based on a marvel comic book character , is , like a comic book , all visual . 
the plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader , deacon frost . 
it's all hokum and nonsense , of course . 
but the filmmakers play it straight . 
unfortunately , at least at the advance screening i attended , the audience didn't see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings . 
you know a movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter . 
another tell-tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero's costume more than the hero . 
also it seems it's not enough for today's vampire merely to have fangs . 
he must also be proficient in the martial arts . 
why a supernatural being , one of the undead , needs such skills is beyond me . 
 ( of course , this concept dates to the 1974 hammer films-run run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires , in which dracula is defeated by seven karate-chopping siblings . ) 
wesley snipes is buff as blade . 
he growls his lines -the few he has - and spends most of the time glowering - as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second thoughts about starring in and co-producing this turkey . 
blade is just another example of how the vampire film , a once honorable member of the horror family , has gone downhill . 
this dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face . 
today's vampires lack the panache , the style of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee . 
they are not even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers' capes . 
they are more farcical than frightful . 
this whole enterprise is one dull blade that could have used lots of sharpening . 

   it happens every year -- the days get longer , the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their big-budget blockbusters . 
this year's crop already seems inferior to that of past summers , even 1997's lackluster trio of batman & robin , the fifth element and the lost world . 
the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla ( " heeere , lee-zerd , lee-zerd . . . " ) , which doesn't make me optimistic about future summers . 
godzilla is , of course , based on a series of cult movies ( translation : really bad movies only a few people can tolerate ) from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner-owned cable stations . 
that this big-budget remake won't rise above its roots is fairly obvious . 
the credits show us the origin of godzilla . 
in five words : nuclear explosion creates giant lizard . 
sounds like an enquirer headline , doesn't it ? 
the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable " discovery " sequence . 
this time , a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling ( if that ain't a stereotype . . . ) 
when he discovers the telltale radar blip . 
people die . 
cut to our protagonist , played by matthew broderick . 
he makes his first appearance wearing headphones , warbling along to " singin' in the rain . " 
it's a none-too-subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie . 
no dice , bueller . 
from the beginning , poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla's enormous footprint . 
every disaster movie has to have a know-it-all scientist , and this time broderick is it . 
as the world's leading expert on radiated earthworms ( and wouldn't you love to have that printed on your business card ? ) , 
broderick is invaluable to the government . 
he immediately dispels vicki lewis' theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because , hey , you can't take seriously the intellectual arguments of " newsradio " cast members . 
broderick instead hits the nail on the head , announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard . 
 " the radiation isn't an anamoly , " he announces , and lightning strikes . 
 " i believe this is a mutated abberation , " he continues , and lightning strikes again . 
it's vocabulary lightning , you see , activated by words of four syllables or more . 
meanwhile , we're introduced to our new york cast , headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist ( maria patillo ) , broderick's former love . 
gee , what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time ? 
poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer . 
italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she's not ruthless enough : " nice doesn't get you anywhere in this town . 
it's dog eat dog . " 
actually , it's lizard eat city , as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple's core . 
the filmmakers provide us with a one-note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla . 
 " i think i've got a bite , " he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him . 
you can guess what happens next . 
similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city . 
hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps , one new yorker remarks , " please don't tell me that's another parade . " 
please don't tell me that's the best line you could come up with . 
mayor ebert is not pleased . 
played by the principal from " head of the class , " he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option , and bickers with his assistant gene . 
i guess the filmmakers knew they'd be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didn't even bother to kiss ass . 
the problem is , if you're going to attack siskel and ebert , you should at least make it funny . 
dialogue like , " didn't we agree that we weren't going to have any sweets until after the election ? " 
followed by , " back off , gene , " just doesn't work for me . 
other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick character's last name and frenchman jean reno's inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york . 
there's even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses . 
as the beast heads back into hiding , broderick suggests the military lure it out with food . 
cue twelve dump trucks , all dropping fish into a new york intersection . 
 ( broderick : that's a lot of fish . ) 
that ambush fails , but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying $50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them . 
yep , godzilla's with children , which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla . 
that's until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually , like linda tripp . 
godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day , so it has a lot of dumb action scenes , destructive special effects and shallow subplots . 
look no further than patillo's betrayal of broderick ( patillo : what have i done , animal ? 
what have i become ? ) and the climactic " godzilla's nest " sequence in madison square garden . 
the main difference is , independence day was about the experience . 
it had a real global , patriotic element to it , and some genuinely fun characters . 
godzilla has lots of rain and lightning , reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak , blockbuster , juicy fruit , swatch , sprint and bumble bee tuna . 
yes , bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla . 
that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie . 

   there isn't much good about this movie . 
not much i can say about the acting , directing , or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie . 
so i'll get my one good comment out of the way , at least joel schuemacher ( batman & robin ) didn't direct it or it would be titled " technicolor city " . 
in fact there is nothing colorful about this movie , its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end . 
the plot has a tendency to be interesting , but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been a fascinating movie . 
the plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets , so i will just touch on the bare minimum . 
john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel , only to find out he has forgotten everything . 
john must find out who he is before the " strangers " ( a . k . a . 
mind erasing aliens ) find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy . 
during the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality , and the existence of inherently evil people . 
any of these points however are completely " erased " from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script . 
as i mentioned earlier , nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film . 
the acting is bland , and since there is virtually no character development no one seems to care . 
the special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake , a sign of a true " b-movie " . 
the direction is poor and there is little continuity , not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly . 
lastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality , and doesn't deserve to have the word " science " in science-fiction . 
if i haven't got my point across , i'll say it more plainly : this is a bad movie . 
lets hope the next movie by alex " i wish i was tim burton " proyas is at least tolerable . 

   synopsis : big-breasted and dim-witted sculptress britt gets really mad at her grad student boyfriend because he spends too much time on his thought-transference experiments instead of her art showings . 
elderly , evil scientist everett longstreet switches minds with britt's boy , in the meantime , and goes completely mental . 
comments : naked souls opens with a naked woman , and the movie makes no illusion that it's a sci-fi vehicle designed to show pamela anderson's , um , talents . 
if you are really interested in seeing anderson's talents , however , i suggest you skip over this dud and watch the infamous pam and tommy lee honeymoon sex tape , now available on home video . 
at least with that " movie , " you don't have to go through the painful experience of watching pamela try to pronounce multiple syllable words like " eclectic . " 
a premise does exist in the movie . 
basically , while anderson wears skimpy clothes which barely contain her talents , she practices her art -- brilliantly slapping plaster of paris on naked women . 
her boyfriend , meanwhile , spends 20 hours a day in a morgue trying to view the memories of dead prison inmates because this will " make a difference to humanity . " 
whatever . 
the movie fails to explain how these two hooked up . 
be grateful . 
after we meet the evil everett longstreet , lots of technobabble and mystical mumbo-jumbo get tossed about , pammy has sex replete with cheesy make-out music , and minds get transferred . 
never fear , though , pammy uses her sharp mental abilities ( ahem ) to save her boyfriend in the end . 
unfortunately , no one saves the movie . 
avoid this would-be sci-fi thriller , unless you're in for a good laugh or two . 

   according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers , isolated motels , diners , gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers . 
at the beginning of eye of the storm , 1991 german- american thriller directed by yuri zeltser , one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up . 
ten years later their son steven ( played by bradley gregg ) , who was blinded during the incident , still runs motel together with his older brother ray ( played by craig sheffer ) . 
hardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone ( played by dennis hopper ) gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra ( played by lara flynn boyle ) . 
their unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed . 
yuri zeltser , author of this film , was obviously inspired by hitchcock's psycho , but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot . 
instead of norman bates we have two brothers - one of them traumatised physically , another mentally . 
sexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband . 
eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense , with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere . 
the acting is fine - hopper , gregg and boyle are comfortable with their roles , but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine . 
unfortunately , eye of the storm , which was supposed to be intense psychological drama , deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale . 
in the end , this film reminds us that original approach can't prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities . 
 ( special note to the profiler fans : ally walker appears in the beginning of the film in the small role of killer's girlfriend . ) 

   when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects . 
while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don't think that they are completely to blame for this movie's failure . 
it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the " unseen " terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny . 
so special effects or not , if the story isn't the least bit scary , you aren't going to end up with a very frightening movie . 
the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern . 
dern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie . 
as i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern's caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast . 
never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie . 
liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear . 
he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion . 
he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia . 
and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on . 
catherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects . 
like the original , taylor's character is the star of the movie . 
but since she doesn't quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms . zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original . 
and let's face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones . 
i'll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren't in it . 
but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets . 
they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients . 
there really isn't much of a story here . 
just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with . 
and the special effects are great . 
in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere . 
in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the " cool shots " quota . 
at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe . 
but not scary . 
then we have the set . 
when i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it . 
but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route . 
this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves . 
what part did these rooms play in the story ? 
absolutely none . 
they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie . 
then we have the actors . 
lili taylor has never been one of my favorites . 
and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark . 
i have no idea why liam neeson took this role . 
he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus . 
his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him . 
i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman . 
zeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words . 
the fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake . 
all catherine has to do in this movie is look good . 
fortunately that is something she does very well . 
while she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye-candy . 
it's too bad someone of her talents wasted them here . 
any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role . 
the haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999's horror movies , the blair witch project . 
the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares . 
both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film . 
if the story sucks , it's all downhill from there . 
my advice ? 
if you are looking for special effects , go rent star wars . 
if it's scares you want , rent halloween . 
either way , it's probably in your best interests to skip the haunting . 

   plot : set in the future , a courier has uploaded some data into a " hard drive " that resides in his head , and must now escape the bad guys who are after that very important information . 
since he overloaded his " hard drive " , he's also racing against the clock before the information seeps into his brain and kills him . 
critique : incoherent , boring , one-act drivel with no suspense , horribly unbelievable futuristic environment , bad dialogue , career-defining bad acting by keanu reeves and a hilarious ending . 
it's too bad because the premise of the film was interesting , but unfortunately for my friends and i , this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us . 
it's one of those films that makes you start laughing half-way through , when you realize that most of the actors in it suck , the location shots are filmed in dark " junkyard " type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic ( whatever . . . ) , and all the sets look like . . . . well , 
sets . 
there is also absolutely no arc to this story . 
it basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain , and then a bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until a laughable ending puts a stop to the former uneventful proceedings . 
gibson should stick to writing novels and " x-files " episodes , since his segue into the paranormal tv series was much more entertaining than any of this garbage . 
some other hilarities of this film include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose supposed to kick ass , henry rollins as a pumped-up cyber-doctor or something , and ice-t as some kind of a hobo dude with paint all over his face ( don't ask ) . 
the ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghost-lady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point . 
i'm ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal , canada , but sadly enough for us all , it was . 
some of the cyber-travelling special effects were okay ( hence , the 2/10 ) , but overall , it's one of those bad movies that's just funny to watch and cringe at . 
thankfully for keanu , he redeemed his sci-fi career with 1999's the matrix ( 7 . 5/10 ) . 
it's too bad that he has yet to redeem his lack of acting talent . 
little known facts about this film and its stars : as of 1999 , director robert longo never directed another full-feature film . 
hmmm . . . now 
isn't that odd ? 
 : ) writer william gibson immigrated from the us to canada in 1968 , after being rejected for the draft . 
he lived in toronto at first , but since 1972 , has made vancouver his home . 
his 1984 novel " neuromancer " and its sequels 1986's " count zero " and 1988's " mona lisa overdrive " are generally considered to be the definitive works of the " cyberpunk " science-fiction sub-genre . 
this film garnered keanu reeves a nomination in the " worst actor " category in the 1996 razzie awards . 

   when i watch a movie like mike nichols' what planet are you from ? 
i can't help but feel like everyone is looking at me . 
it's as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness , eyes shooting daggers , quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hard-earned money to spend their time watching this . . . 
this . . . 
thing . 
i shift uncomfortably in my seat . 
i'm reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second- or third-rate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted " funny " conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award . 
it's not my fault , i know it's not my fault , but dammit , someone's gotta be embarrassed , because it doesn't look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame . 
i'm about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together : garry shandling , annette bening , john goodman , greg kinnear , mike nichols . 
do any of these names make you instantly shudder ? 
the answer i would have come up with before today is no , this is quite a list of talented individuals we've got here . 
granted , john goodman was in the flintstones , and greg kinnear has turned in some less-than-lackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours , but even so , they've got proven power as excellent supporting players . 
garry shandling has two television classics under his belt , his ingenious little it's garry shandling's show and the larry sanders show . 
and for god's sake , mike nichols directed the graduate , and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty . 
so explain this . . . 
this . . . 
thing . 
what planet are you from ? 
purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop-psychology mars/venus phenomenon . 
but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringe-inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe-inducing moments ; the end result is , unsurprisingly , an unfunny , uninsightful , cringe-inducing , thoroughly icky embarrassment . 
garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males ( they reproduce through cloning , of course ) . 
his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth , find a female of the species , and impregnate her . 
they're taught how to pretend that they're listening by nodding and saying " uh-huh , " and how to compliment shoes . 
imagine my delighted surprise when , oh heavens , all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably , producing comedic results ! 
the lucky winner is fitted with a penis ( since theirs , after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence . . . 
i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that they're all just clones . . . 
whoops , too late . ) 
the penis , when aroused , tends to make a humming noise . 
the writers , when frequently strapped for ideas , tend to turn to this as a source of " comedy . " 
it isn't funny the first time . 
it isn't funny the eighth time . 
it isn't funny the eighteenth time . 
if anything , it made me feel vaguely self-conscious . 
garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear , who turns out to be a generic , unlikable scumbag . 
he's meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling's alien character , but he's so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside . 
kinnear's scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples' work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents' position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks . 
wow . 
what a magnificent bastard . 
nearly every man in the movie , in fact , is played as the same sort of sex-driven slimeball . 
when kinnear's wife walks into the office , there isn't a single guy who doesn't trip , bump into a wall , or otherwise pratfall as if they'd never seen a woman before . 
the few guys that aren't particularly slimeballs , such as john goodman's detective character , are simply uncommunicative workaholics . 
shandling meets up with annette bening , who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed , at one of kinnear's aa meetings . 
shandling's mission is to have a baby , and when he reveals his desires to her , bening instantly falls for him , and the next day . . . 
they get married . 
yup . 
the next day . 
cuz ya see , it turns out she wants a baby too ! 
bening's character perhaps was the most difficult to watch , especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty . . . 
if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as a whole , then woe , i say , to the species . 
she's unfathomably insecure , and succumbs so easily to all of shandling's lines and lies that it borders on tragic . 
there's a point where , after thinking she may not be able to bear children , she learns that she is indeed pregnant . 
when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her , she strolls into the kitchen and sings " high hopes " ( you know , the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song ) to deliver the news , and then says to him , " now you can't leave me . " 
we're supposed to empathize with shandling's discovery of the feeling of " guilt , " but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing . 
and eventually , shandling falls in love with her . . . 
for real , i suppose , though i'm not sure exactly what prompted it . 
what's the message i derive from all this ? 
men are liars , inherently empty creatures , but if you hang around long enough . . . 
well , maybe something will click . 
ha ha . . . 
ha ? 
i'm thankful such broad cynicism isn't frequently allowed to run so rampant . 
let's all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one . 
there's also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity . 
goodman , through a series of astoundingly implausible realizations , puts together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic , vibrating penis . 
it has all the makings for a subplot of having shandling be discovered , that , thankfully , never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition . 
instead , it just dangles limply on the branch for a while , withers , and falls away . 
further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies . 
but let's not dwell on this any longer , i've already wasted plenty of your time and my own . 
let's move on , forget about what we've seen here , and get on with our lives . 
and to help us out , let's end things on a happy note . . . 
congratuations go out to annette bening , winner of this week's " title ! " 
award , for delivering the awkward line of dialog containing the movie's name . 

   we're back in blade runner territory with this one , conceptual artist robert longo's vision of a william gibson-inspired future where information is the commodity to kill for . 
front and center is johnny ( keanu reeves ) , a " cyber-courier " who smuggles data via a " wet-wired " implant . 
he's ready to quit the biz and get a portion of his long-term memory restored , but , first , he has to finish one last , dangerous job . . 
the pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems to have forgotten how to play an action hero since his stint on speed . 
he's walking wood in a forest of stiffs that includes henry rollins , ice-t , and dina meyer . 
 ( dolph lundgren's street preacher is in an acting category all its own . 
 : - ) without a believable performance between them , all we can do is sit back and watch the atmosphere , which is pretty good in places . 
the vr sequences are way cool , but the physical fx--such as miniatures and mattes--leave a lot to be desired . 
watch out for those bad blue-screens ! 
we wouldn't mind a minute of johnny mnemonic if the action played better . 
too bad the debut director isn't very strong in this de- partment . 
his big finale is a sloppy , silly mess that runs twenty minutes too long , which is way past the time that most of our " wet- wired " processors have already shut down . 
bottom line : yatf ( yet another tortured future ) . 
skip it . 

   sylvester stallone has made some crap films in his lifetime , but this has got to be one of the worst . 
a totally dull story that thinks it can use various explosions to make it interesting , " the specialist " is about as exciting as an episode of " dragnet , " and about as well acted . 
even some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy script , stupid and unlikable characters , and just plain nothingness . 
who knew a big explosion could be so boring and anti-climactic ? 
unless you saw " blown away " . . . 
 " the specliast " of the title is none other than action star sylvester stallone ( in comeback #19 , i think ) , who plays a quiet , hermit-like bomber who was once a bomb expert with the army or something , but who suffered a change of heart when he and his assistant ( james woods , who shows us exactly what over-the-top is , other than another bad sly film ) accidentally killed some innocent people during a job . 
his credo is killing bad people , not innocents . 
and that's why he makes big bombs . 
so anyway , into his life steps the seductive sharon stone , who is basically the girlfriend/moll of the stupid son ( eric roberts ) of a cuban/miami kingpin ( rod steiger , in an indecipherable accent , which is sometimes cuban , sometimes brando , sometimes scottish , etc ) . 
turns out sharon is actually using her boyfriend so she can kill him , since he killed her parents when she was young . 
so she calls sly , leaves messages with him , sends him e-mail , etc , about planting a bomb to kill roberts , which sly listens to obsessively , and while he works out naked . 
yea . 
also into his life , though again , comes woods , who has been tipped off by stone to catch sly . 
using the cops , he tries to set up traps , none which really work , so when sly calls him , he goes ballisitic on his ass over the phone , getting so worked up by saying his must-be-improvised speeches that he seems to pop the vein in his head wide open . 
these are the most exciting scenes in the film , and woods becomes the only ounce of entertainment in the film . 
the film tries to offer us a moody film noir , except with explosions , but comes up completely snake-eyes . 
it's just a pretend film noir , making it a big waste of time . 
and for action buffs , the action scenes are pretty lame , with some really unrealistic-looking special effects ( a penthouse being blown off of a hotel looks like a piece of cardboard falling into a tub ) . 
then there's the much-discussed sex scene between sly and stone , which are about as mispaired a couple as rachel and ross on " friends . " 
their sex scene is more nauseating then sexy , because it shows us more of sly than stone . 
now let's guess who we'd rather see naked , okay ? 
stone's small but perky breasts , which we've seen more times than harvey keitel's dick , or stallone's veiny ass , which isn't usually shown for a very good reason ? 
i know i can't really judge it as a flaw of the film , but come on . 
the worst flaw of the film is this : it's boring . 
i mean , i was on caffeine when watching it , but my friend fell asleep only to be woken up by james woods ranting . 
but a good movie does not james woods going nuts make . 
if you're in for some fun action , rent sly's earlier " demolition man , " which sucks too , but in a much more entertaining fashion . 
skip this dull film , unless you want to see woods , or make fun of steiger's accent , or see stone's breasts again . 

   written by alex cox , tod davies , terry gilliam and tony grisoni 
directed by terry gilliam 
i've always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid . 
dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last . 
then there's the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose . 
mushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth landing . 
acid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy . 
my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas , director terry gilliam has made an acid movie , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie . 
full of shocking sight gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s . thompson's book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world-view from the inside out . 
but for those of us who just want to enjoy a well-made film , gilliam has produced a mixed bag . 
fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self-professed " gonzo " journalist hunter s . thompson ( johnny depp ) and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta ( benicio del toro ) , came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney's convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971 . 
operating under the pseudonyms of " raoul duke " and " dr . 
gonzo " , the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender , then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite , cocaine , tequila and a rainbow of multi-colored uppers and downers . 
they terrorize every one they meet , mostly because every one they meet terrifies them . 
duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town , then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge . 
dr . gonzo becomes enamored of a thick-bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane's " white rabbit " reaches its climax . 
and these guys don't just trash hotel rooms - they rape them , humiliate them and leave them for dead . 
that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence , depending on your point of view . 
thompson's book , besides being a hilarious read , has stood the test of time as an important historical document . 
it simultaneously exposed the 60's drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die . 
pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson's message , but the truth is that , stripped to its bare essentials , what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy . 
it's a cheech and chong movie . 
you're there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results : see johnny take drugs , see johnny fall down . 
there's nothing wrong with this concept , but gilliam tries too hard . 
this is a frantic movie - all sweaty close-ups , wide-angle lenses , dutch tilts and other-worldly lighting schemes . 
there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen . 
but to what end ? 
much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson's book , and there are some priceless comic observations . 
but you're hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work . 
this brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong . 
depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c . scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson's dialogue . 
in between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr . gonzo , but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost . 
watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see . 
it's interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co-writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over . 
as much of a fan as i am of gilliam's work , cox would have been the better choice . 
sid and nancy , cox's best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film . 
gilliam commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose . 
what kind of movie was he trying to make , anyway ? 
it doesn't try to be a cautionary tale , and it doesn't work as broad comedy . 
if he had considered more carefully his purpose , the result would have been a much more interesting film . 
but i don't want to be too hard on it . 
there are some truly funny moments , and if you're in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it . 
i do , however , recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance - i guarantee it will enhance the effect . 

   isn't it the ultimate sign of a movie's cinematic ineptitude when you can't think of much to say about it other than " it sucks " ? 
one of the first official year 2000 releases , supernova is such a movie . 
i can't seem to get past one-word adjectives with this one , although " boring , " " stupid " and " absurd " doesn't amount to much of a review . 
a shame . 
i would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate . 
but c'est la vie . 
here goes nothing . 
i'll keep it short . 
i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill ( 48 hours ) removed his name from the movie , requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee . 
the film's fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press , an event usually signifying a studio's lack of confidence in a particular movie . 
hill's and mgm's actions were prudent . 
when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident , a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer , for some reason ( james spader ) is forced to take command . 
the ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and , on arrival , picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony . 
one of the crew members ( angela bassett ) knows this passenger , who is played by peter facinelli , and has some bad feelings about it -- and we all know what that means . 
this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo -- a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown , though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it . 
another one of the crew members experiences this first hand ; after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo , he does some impressive handstand pushups . 
evidently , touching this enigmatic egg-shaped thingie makes you younger and stronger . 
how ? 
why ? 
the movie never bothers to explain . 
soon enough though , spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad , being chased by the all-of-a-sudden-superhuman facinelli . 
to be honest , i don't even remember exactly why . 
i just remember that i didn't care . 
supernova's plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas , such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb , but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing . 
in fact , everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set . 
well , the effects are good , though there's hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so i'm not sure whether that's so remarkable an accomplishment . 
the performances are hardly worth talking about . 
i'm not even sure i can call what's here " performances , " though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger . 
james spader is not a bad actor , but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars i've seen in a while , mostly because he isn't given a character with a personality . 
the action scenes are just as bland , since they're pretty much just rehashes of action elements that weren't particularly entertaining the first time around . 
and since the action scenes are everything to this movie , it's pretty much dead in the water . 
and for the life of me , i can't figure out why it's called supernova . 

   what a contrast ! 
in the space of two days , i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly . 
i'm not sure you could get two more different movies . 
while the former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy of life down our throats , hurlyburly was the complete opposite , wound so tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking about it . 
this is one interesting movie . 
it's very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of '98 , in the company of men , although not quite so nasty . 
there's lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men . 
hurlyburly doens't contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him . 
his big question is : does it all pertain to him ? 
and if it does , how is he supposed to feel about it all ? 
 " it " means everything : television , friends , events that happen . 
i guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what's it all about ? 
this is not a movie for answers . 
donna ( anna paquin ) gives some but they're not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions . 
that's what makes this movie stay on your mind . 
these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time . 
even when we push them to the background , however we resolve these questions influences everything we do . 
the performances are all superb in hurlyburly . 
i haven't seen sean penn in much before ( in fact , i can't remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is brilliant in this . 
eddie isn't a likeable character , but sean penn makes him understandable . 
i don't want to be his friend but i'd like to help him . 
chazz palminteri is also great as phil , making him an awful person . 
i'd never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend . 
everyone in this film nails their performances , making this world real . 
it's a nasty world ; it's a sexist world . 
unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct , hurlyburly is a man's world , seen unapologetically through the eyes of men . 
i find this fascinating and on two counts , depressing . 
first , it's depressing that such a world exists . 
a large part of hurlyburly's success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world , toys , playthings . 
sure , everyone is background to everyone else but in this world , women are a long way in the background . 
second , these are the movies that are being made : stories about men's world . 
where are the stories about women's world ? 
not the soap operas and the " chick flicks " that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men . 
hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts . 
it's very talkative , intelligent and static . 
while this can make the film drag a bit , and people sometimes sound like they're quoting textbooks , mostly this is a good thing . 
not all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas . 
not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience . 
all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen . 
it also means that you have to pay attention . 

   the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride , and it's sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics , both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year's finest films . 
so , naturally , when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found , this notion left me puzzled . 
it is a rare thing for a children's movie to be praised this highly , so wouldn't you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly " magical " piece of work ? 
a tad bewildered , but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films , i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind , having great expectations for the film . 
looking back , i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater . 
believe me ; i wanted to like babe : pig in the city . 
the plot seemed interesting enough ; after the events that took place in the original , babe the sheep-pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon . 
but after a fateful encounter with a water well , arthur hogget ( james cromwell , who the movie could have used alot more of ) has been rendered bed-ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially . 
the only solution that his wife ( magda szubanski , going from delightfully charming to downright annoying ) can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair ( i think ) and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank ( set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public ) . 
problem is , the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded " city " , a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion . 
setting the main plot in motion , mrs . hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals , despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels . 
it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters , the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright . 
here is where the film took a wrong turn . 
up until this point , i had being having a rather enjoyable experience . 
the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs . hogget is accused of smuggling drugs . 
unfortunately , the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel , none of them being even one-tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe . 
the main topic of discussion surrounding babe : pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children , and i believe it is . 
at one point , a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown . 
at other times , we are treated to surrealistic flash-backs to mrs . hogget's full cavity search at the airport . 
in fact , the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing . 
however , that is , as they say , neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway . 
the animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half , let alone entertain a child . 
another problem i found with the film was it's sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story . 
if you're going to make a darker and more sinister sequel , fine . 
it may not be my cup of tea , but at least it is a noble ambition . 
but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs . hogget swinging from wall-to-wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls ? 
it just didn't feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining , and the same goes for the rest of the movie . 

   to put it bluntly , ed wood would have been proud of this . 
a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor , hokey drama , zero logic and a crap screenplay . 
also , a beautifully anti-climactic ending . 
not to say it didn't look intriguing when i saw the previews . 
so much for truth in advertising . 
roland emmerich , who's later " independence day " would look like " the 400 blows " compared to this , co-writed and directed this inane sci-fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens . 
in a useless opening sequence , men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it . 
it wouldn't be till present day ( '94 ) till they would actually figure it out . 
they're decipherer ? 
a slightly-neurotic scientist ( nice twist ) , dr . dan jackson ( james spader , doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare ) who's life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word . 
why do they use him to decipher what no one else could ? 
so there is a hokey ending ! 
duh ! 
he figures it out in about a minute . 
yea . 
and then they get a suicidal colonel or something , " jack " o'neill ( kurt russel , with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat-top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position ) . 
why a suicidal colonel ? 
for the ending ! 
you'll get the hang of this . 
they open the stargate , a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad . 
after an overdone special effects thing , they're . . . inside a goddam pyramid . 
so they went to egypt , right ? 
wrong . 
they're on another planet that was filmed in egypt . 
they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra , the sun god ( the androginous jaye davidson , with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma ) , and there are fights , explosions and a kiss between two people . 
yea . 
also melodrama , stupidity , hokey scenes and a bizarre language . 
an anti-climactic ending ends with stupid lines ( " say hello to king tut , asswhole ! " 
- the quintessential line , lemme tell ya ) and some convenient pesudo-pseudo-pseudo-character development . 
by the end , you just wanna go home and watch , i don't know , the " outer limits " or something . 
the script's terrible . 
the special effects are okay , but nothing great . 
the story's so weak that it's almost opaque . 
the whole experience just isn't worth it unless you're so bored that you'd consider watching a " full house " marathon . . . or 
this . 
i'd pick this , obviously , but still , it's just not fun at all . 
and i can't wait for it to premier on mst3k . 

    " easely one of the worst films of the year . . " 
with the millenium just around the corner , hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century . 
this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil . 
the result is somewhat predictable . 
i didn't have high hopes about arnold's " much anticipated " return to the big screen . 
schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased , action lovers won't be bored , and the catholic league will be angry . 
everyone else will see 'end of days' for what it is : a deliciously bad motion picture . 
think of it as hollywood's own y2k bug . 
did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you'll get 999 , as in 1999 ? 
yes , you better believe it . . satan is here on earth , working on his latest project -- the end of days . 
this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and , although not al pacino , he is fun to behold . 
he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker , wreaking , as they say , havoc . 
the way it works is he smirks and something explodes . 
before the stroke of the new millennium he's got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations . 
only schwarzenegger's cop attached to an anti-terrorist unit can stop him . 
films like this has one serious weakness -- logic . 
no matter how you twist the " plot " , you'll find it incredibly stupid ( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! ) . 
the incredible fact is that such directors never learn . 
after thousands of headless productions , this theme has become one big clich ? . 
here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution . 
he is walking around n . y . , blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius . 
all he wants is the girl , that is somehow special . 
but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks , he has hidden her in a church , where satan dare not enter . 
so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information : " you can have your wife and daughter back . . i 
can give you happiness that you can only dream of . . just 
give me the address . . " 
indeed with a script like that , you could make a wonderful parody , but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously , attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller . 
and for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger's comeback , will not be very satisfied . 
we've not seen him in a while . 
that's because he didn't have a worthy opponent . 
he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars . 
he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop . 
so , after all those fights , what's left for arnold schwarzenegger ? 
how about satan ? 
in my opinion , he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron's " terminator " . 
and that is schwartzenegger's strength -- muscles and no emotions . 
here he tries to achieve an artistic level , moving towards the oscar . 
this is called " an adult turn " if successful and " a flop " if unsuccessful . 
make a wild guess ! 
his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems . 
this requires at least some acting skills . 
regrettably , the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles . 
the rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters . 
the movie is otherwise technically impressive , with a solid cinematography and fine lighting . 
but the movie doesn't serve neither as a serious thriller ( because of its stupidity ) nor as comic entertainment ( because of its serious tone ) . 
the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry . 
the action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular . 
so i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody . 
unless you are a die-hard schwartzenegger fan , stay away . 
as for schwarzenegger , he'll be back . 

    " tarzan and the lost city " is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while . 
not only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid . 
unfortunately , it's not bad in the way great , colossal misfires like " heaven's gate " ( 1980 ) or " ishtar " ( 1987 ) were bad . 
instead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place . 
with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? 
of course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984's " greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes " ) down to the really bad ( 1981's " tarzan , the ape man " with bo derek ) . 
most of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps . 
therefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others . 
 " greystoke " added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even " tarzan , the ape man " at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek's bare breasts . 
 " tarzan and the lost city , " on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue . 
the script , by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come . 
comic books have better plots than this . 
the movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer's comedy " george of the jungle . " 
didn't the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ? 
the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage . 
when the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week . 
however , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa's last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle . 
at first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man . 
once the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city . 
most of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of . 
there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from " raiders of the lost ark " ( 1981 ) to " the goonies " ( 1985 ) . 
when the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river . 
the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality . 
for instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he doesn't even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do . 
instead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival . 
of course , one can't help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is . 
not to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city . 
there is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) . 
which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it's sitting right out in the middle of an open field ? 
strictly speaking , " tarzan and the lost city " isn't even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien's laughably stiff performance comes real close . 
this movie proves what " starship troopers " only hinted at : he cannot act , but he sure looks well-groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle . 
van dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; he's a calvin klein model in a loin cloth . 
i also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut . 
waddington makes a decent villain , although he's like a charmless version of belloq from " raiders of the lost ark . " as jane , the ex-model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan . 
she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two , but whenever a snake comes into the picture , she is reduced to a hysterical mess . 
however , amidst all this complaining , i do have one piece of good news . 
 " tarzan and the lost city " is so lacking in ideas both new and old , that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid . 
so , we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short . 

   a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title , a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided , for this confused , confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle , producer andrew macdonald , and screenwriter john hodge . 
at the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and , yes , ordinary--premise . 
after robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspiring writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation , he kidnaps naville's ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom . 
the joke here is that celine is a willing victim--her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she wants revenge--and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping . . . 
and , ultimately ( didn't we see this one coming ? ) , 
love . 
so far , so mediocre . 
but mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is , thanks in no small part to the hodge's contextual frame for the romance . 
it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven's police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o'reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert--or lose their angel status . 
this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture . 
but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand . 
not that there is much of a romance to begin with . 
try as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one-note to become very endearing characters . 
celine is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard . 
as such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two--then again , they never seem to really connect with each other . 
when celine and robert start to overtly act on their " feelings , " it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural . 
but i am not exactly sure if boyle and company's point was romance ; honestly , i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish . 
boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that--energy , not energy in service of a story or even acting . 
the cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling . 
and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels , who are not exactly angelic--in fact , they end up staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue . 
watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool . 
instead , the film just gives quirky a bad name . 
my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes , misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing " beyond the sea " at a karaoke bar . 
after a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter . 
the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard , just relying on the innate charm of the leads , allowing them to build a romantic rapport . 
alas , not nearly enough is built , for this moment comes to an abrupt end . 
i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses , but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill . 
a life less ordinary certainly delivers something " different , " but by the time the film was over , i was clamoring for a life more ordinary . 
 " i can accept failure . 
everyone fails at something . 
but i can't accept not trying . 
it doesn't matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart . "

   i am continually amazed at movies like this . 
that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mind-boggeling , but it seems to happen a lot nowadays . 
 " wild wild west " is a beautifully filmed , well acted , and well directed piece of garbage ; and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault . 
in short , this movie is a comedy without laughs . 
so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal . 
the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco , but it's still pretty boring . 
will smith stars as jim west , an old western , r&b variation of the james bond character . 
west is teamed up with artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , and they're pretty much polar oppisites : west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets , gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach . 
talk about deeply developed characters . 
at any rate , this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies , none of which are funny . 
the year is 1869 . 
several top scientists have been abducted , and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general , bloodbath mcgrath ( ted levine ) . 
president grant sends west and gordon to investigate . 
there's evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana . 
west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , another disgruntled former confederate . 
as it turns out , loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon , which he will use to conquer the united states . 
i'd go further with the plot , but there isn't any point . 
this film's narrative is little more than a jumbled , unfunny mess . 
i only laughed at a couple of jokes , and then only lightly . 
there isn't one truly uprorously funny moment in this film , and that's pretty disasterous when you consider that it's primarily a comedy . 
as i said , the fault is totally that of the script . 
when you consider their respective roles , will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done . 
the leads could've been played samuel l . jackson and robert de niro and the film still would've been awful . 
no one , and i mean no one , can make a line like " bye bye , mr . knife guy ! " 
sound good . 
still , this film has a lot going for it visually . 
the set design is fantastic , maybe even oscar worthy . 
the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus ( who was also behind camera in martin scorsese's brilliant " goodfellas " ) , is absolutely stunning . 
he lends the film a much needed exciting , comic bookish look . 
i won't fault barry sonnenfeld either . 
he does a fine job of directing the proceedings , but , like the rest of the people involved with the film , there really isn't anything that he can do to correct its one major flaw . 
despite being beautifully made , " wild wild west " becomes quite boring after the half-way point . 
the appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does . 
if " wild wild west " didn't look so good , it would be almost insufferable . 
as it is , it's somewhat tolerable , but not very entertaining . 
it hurts to give such a well made movie a score this low , but there isn't anything much worse than an unfunny comedy . 

   synopsis : a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar . 
the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary , while his wife disapproves . 
meanwhile , a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession . 
comments : why is this movie called possessed by the night ? 
it's hard to speculate . 
most of this film takes place during the day , and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky , pulsating , bubbling brain thingie in a jar . 
in case you haven't picked up on this yet , possessed by the night is a bottom-of-the-barrel " thriller " ( i use the term " thriller " loosely here ) which is really cheap and bad . 
the plot , which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s , actually serves one purpose : to exploit nude women as often as possible . 
writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging . 
there's really not much to say . 
the acting is lousy ; although , occasionally , the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience . 
most humorous is frank sivero , who plays murray , the novelist's agent . 
he is so horrible in this role that one can't help but be amused . 
the plot sucks . 
nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession , even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole . 
the dialogue stinks . 
a loan shark , for instance , tells another how much he loves bimbos , which is something the audience really doesn't need to know . 
everything about possessed by the night is second rate , even the film credits . 
as the names of the not-so-talented film crew scrolled by at the end , joseph scales came up , credited as being " assistsant to foley artist . " 
someone could have used an editor ! 
to be honest , the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes . 
playboy playmate shannon tweed , after all , is the star here . 
i suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing , he would like this movie . 
why did i give this turkey two stars and not one ? 
as a bad movie , it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film . 
if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night , however , i'd recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else . 

   there's only one presidential election every four years , but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as _the_ thriller of the year . 
in 1997 , we've had absolute power , air force one , shadow conspiracy and murder at 1600 . 
this one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford , trying to bring us a complex plot of cover-up and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys . 
here's what happens this time . 
it's night at the white house . 
a secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt . 
the next day she's dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in . 
how do we know he's a hotshot ? 
we've seen the traditional action flick opener -- the clever hostage negotiation scene . 
it's not so clever this time , consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal ex-government employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street . 
snipes is off to the white house , where he finds the secret service head ( the shiny bald head of daniel benzali ) won't cooperate with him at all . 
in fact , if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda , snipes wouldn't have been allowed in the white house at all . 
alda helps snipes out further , assigning a sexy secret service agent ( diane lane ) to act as his liaison . . . 
a very dangerous liaison . 
well , not really , i just wanted to say that . 
almost immediately , a suspect is found , an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos . 
snipes doesn't buy it , and launches into an independent investigation of his own , one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the president's son . 
snipes' partner , an always- wisecracking dennis miller , calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane , who at first doesn't believe snipes , eventually and predictably comes around , and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information . 
for the first hour or so , murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting . 
sure , we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that , but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon . 
snipes and lane don't make for a bad action team , but with nothing to work with , they're just cogs in the bad movie machine . 
dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie ; they waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than they did in bordello of blood , and that's saying a lot . 
when you get to the last half-hour , the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into a wet sewer , busting out the old break-into-the-building underground climax . 
and when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why , you'll wish you never sat through this movie at all . 
the " 1600 " in the movie's title doesn't represent an address , it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide . 
serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century ! 

   you know something , christmas is not about presents . 
it's about over-hyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tie-ins . 
at least that would seem to be the message of " the grinch , " which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores . 
hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season . 
you know the plot : there's this evil furry green guy called the grinch ( jim carrey ) who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville . 
down below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation , but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas . 
the movie is , of course , a live-action version of the beloved children's book , which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones . 
it's rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirty-year-old half-hour cartoon , but that's the case when jones' version is compared to ron howard's . 
the tv grinch hit all the right notes : boris karloff's soft , deep narration ; thurl ravenscroft singing " mr . grinch " ; max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head ; and the grinch's wide , toothless grin . 
by contrast , the movie hits one sour note after another . 
first , there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105-minute movie . 
young wide-eyed cindy lou who ( taylor momsen ) is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents ( bill irwin and molly shannon ) during the holiday season . 
she begins to sympathize with the grinch , who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic . 
cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class , martha may whovier ( played as an adult by christine baranski ) . 
are we expected to like the grinch , hate the whos , and want him to steal christmas ? 
the grinch isn't even the villain here ; that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville ( jeffrey tambor ) who was the grinch's rival for martha's affection . 
not only are the characters needlessly complex , but the once-simple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought . 
the casting choices aren't any better than the screenwriting decisions . 
jim carrey seems woefully miscast . 
while his face is so supple that the rubber make-up seems superfluous , carrey brings nothing else to the role . 
his accent keeps changing ; i assume he was shooting for karloff , but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon , sean connery , and cartman from " south park . " 
not knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinch's home , carrey falls back on his stand-up comedy and clowns around ace ventura-style . 
needless to say , his wise-cracking antics don't quite fit the character of the grinch , who is an embittered loner filled with hate . 
little taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile . 
she would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story ( finding " santa " in her living room stealing the tree ) . 
however , the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch , and momsen is not up to the challenge . 
bottom line : when you're stealing christmas ( movies ) , leave this one behind . 

   take a look at the following equation . . . . 
a christmas carol+ghostbusters=scrooged 
yes , scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment , comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether . 
scrooged is alternatively sick , gross , funny , and then sickly soppy . 
bill murray plays frank cross , a t . v executive with a horrible personality . 
he's evil to secretary , actors , crew , everyone , except the t . v's station's boss , of course ( played by the late robert mitchum ) however , he is then visited by a very dead exec , who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts , past , present and future ( who is called the ghost of yet to come , for some reason ) sure enough , they arrive , show cross how much of a s . o . b he is , and he changes his way . 
however , throughout this simple plot , we've got to suffer outlandish special effects , poor comedy , and an very , very mean performance from bill murray . 
frank cross isn't 'funny' mean , he's just mean . 
he also isn't very good at emotional scenes , and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film , with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is , and how he has changed . 
however , the supporting cast are ok , with good performances from mitchum , allen ( who plays his girlfriend ) and john glover ( who plays cross's 'partner' ) the ghost of christmas past isn't that bad either . 
sadly , though , the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of 'home alone' style violence from the ghost of christmas present , played by carol kane . 
whoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny , should be fired straight away . 
and the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait ( the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3 , if i remeber correctly . . . . ) 
who , thankfully , dosen't say much . 
the script is horrendous . 
michael o'donaghue churns out terrible , bad taste jokes ( which i guess is the whole point really ) then changes direction completely to emotional scenes . 
and he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes , which are awful . 
the special effects look nice , but do nothing for the film . 
there's some impressive make up effects also . 
the music is also good , which is scored by danny elfman . 
but great effects and make up don't make a great film . 
scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience , seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway , and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech . 
why didn't cross just look out his exec window , and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him ? 
overall , then , you'd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided ( perhaps a plague ) 

   yet another brainless teen flick , this one is about , surprise , drugs and sex . 
stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn't look more bored . 
their characters are cardboard cut-outs of every cliched teenager out there . 
one thing you need to know is i really hated this movie . 
everything about it annoyed the hell out of me . 
the acting , and script , the plot , and ending . 
the director ( of the fluke hit swingers ) could have very well directed a bunch of no-name actors and had a watchabe film . 
the " big " stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality . 
i felt like i was watching dawson's creek episode 200 . 
although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast . 
the " surprise " ending was sooo predictable . 
since when is a male character's sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore ? ? 
go is dawson's creek + varsity blues - she's all that = go home and watch something else . 

   humanities quest for knowledge never ends . 
so a team of scientists and film-makers travel to the amazon to search for a legendary indian tribe . 
the party consists of anthropologist steven cale ( eric stoltz ) and the camera team consisting of terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , danny rich ( ice cube ) , gary dixon ( owen wilson ) , denise kahlberg ( kari wuhrer ) and warren westridge ( jonathan hyde ) . 
early on their journey they meet paul sarone ( jon voight ) whose boat is stuck on the shore . 
they agree to give him a ride to the next village . 
he claims to know the area well and can be useful locating the native tribe . 
very soon their friendliness backfires on the group because sarone turns out to be a snake hunter without scruples who only wants to catch a giant anaconda and sell it to a zoo . 
we don't have to wait too long for the giant snake . 
she just had a panther hors d'oevre and now is looking for the main course . 
our heroes paddle around in the amazonas as if it were the pool in their own backyard . 
no wonder giant animals mistake their splashing for a dinner bell . 
our anaconda is a polite one and swallows the first victim in one big gulp . 
enjoy ! 
so much for the first attempt to catch her . 
but who would want to catch a giant snake with a fishing pole ? 
our villain sarone shows his soft side when he stops terri from shooting the snake . 
too bad that anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition . 
one by one she goes after the others . 
eric stoltz is stung by a giant wasp right in the beginning and is mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure . 
the rest of the crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not the way the makers of the movie had planned . 
however the scenes without the anaconda are rather boring . 
whenever the leading lady shows up we're in for a laugh . 
the snake reminds us of a favorite character of a famous animated movie even if she should be an awe-inspiring monster . 
her attacks always follow the same plan : one last hypnotic look - she's looking at you , kid - then she speedily wraps herself around her victim and starts to gush it down . 
mostly we don't see the act of devouring . 
but she looks nice when she wiggles away with her bulging middle part . 
whoever did the special effects on this movie may have wanted to go to a zoo first and study some real snakes . 
maybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real . 
the animatronics are somewhat more believable . 
but that didn't work for the strangling scenes . 
don't go see the movie for the f/x . 
they are everything but up-to-date . 
the viewer who likes to watch the end credits will see to his/her surprise that a snake expert was a consultant for the team . 
we may doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work . 
a well known american science magazine is also mentioned in the credits , but i will refrain from naming it here to avoid further damage to its reputation . 
the majority of viewer will have left the theater as soon as the credits start rolling , anyway . 
what kind of audience is the target group for this movie ? 
hard to say . 
this can't be a serious horror movie , or can it ? 
see for yourself . 

   ever feel you're spending your whole life on the net ( ouch ! ) , eating , breathing and excreting web sites ? 
that your most meaningful relationships are being formed on the net ? 
that you get your best sex on the net ? 
if first-time director hal salwen could shoot an entire movie of characters typing at their computers , he would . 
as it is , he settles for characters talking on the phone . 
denise calls up is a movie for and about the electronic generation , where characters are too caught up with their work and insecurities prefer to live out their relationships and fantasies on the phone . 
it's a satire - and a sometimes funny one - about how we let handphones , call-waiting and answering machines run our lives . 
the problem : denise calls up is a movie about an idea . 
a darn good one , but still an 80 minute-long idea . 
and despite salwen's attempt at plots and sub-plots , despite some genuinely funny moments , you can predict the movie's outcome within the first fifteen minutes . 
you get the drift after a series of shots of characters explaining over the phone why they all couldn't make it for a party - nobody is going to be meeting anybody in this film , they would rather be talking on the phone . 
here's salwen's plot : while all the characters are in a dysfunctional , telefixated limbo , loud quirky stranger denise calls up martin to announce that she is pregnant with his child , courtesy of the sperm he donated to the local bank . 
as martin progresses from slamming the phone on her to long phone conversations over the baby's name , his friends - and his friends' friends - get involved , courtesy of call-waiting and double-lines . 
in the tigher and more tantalizing sub-plot , barbara and jerry are set up on a blind date that neither turns up for . 
both profess to have too complicated schedules to ever meet , but they get it going over the phone . 
with repeated phone sex comes a glitch ; what if the other person is simply faking it ? 
denise calls up scores with some inspired moments . 
mousy barbara metamorphoses into a vamp over her cordless , everyone shares the excitement of denise's delivery through a conference call to her handphone , and barbara's best friend gale is killed in a car accident while taling animatedly into another friend's answering machine . 
 ( as gale's overly-chatty aunt recounts , her cordless was knicked into her ear and lodged in her brain . ) 
but these moments are not enough to sustain the movie . 
the pace sags , the dialogue drags and not much acting appears to be required of the telephone-touters . 
and the ending is literally a non-event as expected , everyone is too chicken to turn up for the party frank throws in gale's memory despite promising over the phone that they will . 
we get the point . 
the movie appears to be intent on flogging its terribly-'90s statement until they have it coming out of your ears . 
pun intended . 
there's even a on the movie's web site where you can win cellular phones ( as if we haven't had enough of these things already ) . 
watch the movie only if you find it philosophy compelling enough for a earful . 
the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . 
 * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
 * * * pretty good , bring a friend . 
 * * * * amazing , potent stuff . 
 * * * * * perfection . 
see it twice . 

   in a typical cinematic high school , the football jocks have sex with the girls and then dump them , but not before the boys' scores are dutifully recorded in their little black books . 
as the sexual acts take place , the other guys hang out nearby , guzzling beer and grunting like pigs . 
in the rage : carrie 2 , robert mandel's terminally bland sequel to carrie , there isn't a single original moment . 
only amy irving returns from carrie , and the talent of the rest of the sequel's cast is impossible to determine given the stupefying mediocrity of rafael moreu's script . 
as rachel , the horror story's lead , emily bergl gives one of the least scary performances in recent memory , but it isn't exactly her fault . 
the director asks for little from his actors , which is precisely what he gets . 
sporadically in this lame and lifeless movie , rachel will cause school lockers and windows to fly open , but generally she just mopes around looking like a victim . 
her fellow students delight in tormenting her . 
of course , she will get her revenge in the obligatory ending bloodbath in which she will decapitate and castrate the boys and crush the girls with burning timbers . 
as the movie marks time until its big finale , it throws in some repugnant scenes , hoping to turn audience's stomachs . 
rachel's girlfriend commits a horrible and realistic suicide after the boy who made " love " to her the night before spurns her . 
 ( he gets major points in his black book for this , but his buddies say he would have gotten more if he had had sex with her after her death . ) 
even a helpless puppy is run over , and we see his poor , little body flipping over and over under a truck . 
the teenagers in the movie are completely blas ? about it all . 
 " doesn't it offend you that some girl offed herself yesterday , " asks one of the few kids with a conscience . 
 " why ? " 
responds his nonplussed girlfriend . 
 " she wasn't anybody . " 
remarkably devoid of any energy , especially for a horror flick , the movie makes one yearn for a fast forward button on the theater's armrest . 
with material this bad , the film's only hope is to go for parody , but it isn't smart enough to realize it . 
even the mandatory epilogue is as pointless and predictable as the rest of the movie . 
the rage : carrie 2 runs 1 : 45 . 
it is rated r for graphic violence , teen alcohol abuse , sex , nudity and profanity and would be acceptable only for older teenagers . 

   man , this was one wierd movie . 
similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn't decide which genre it is . 
the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone , which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship . 
the last half hour ? 
this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided - " screw it , let's just kill everybody " . 
from then on - forget sci-fi . . . this 
movie becomes 100% horror . 
what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way . 
instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare - this movie just uses loud noises , sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore . . . . . yawn . . . . everyone's 
seen it all before and knows when to expect it . 
the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew . 
there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed , but what did this ? 
then finally after being painfully restored - the new crew views the video . 
the acting isn't too bad at all . . . . . considering what the actors had to work with anyway , as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of . 
there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though , like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space . 
this movie could have been so much better . 
it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with . 
there was just nothing new here that any of us haven't seen before in aliens or hellraiser . 

   two party guys bob their heads to haddaway's dance hit " what is love ? " 
while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub . 
it's barely enough to sustain a three-minute _saturday_night_live_ skit , but _snl_ producer lorne michaels , _clueless_ creator amy heckerling , and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution's recurring " roxbury guys " sketch that would presumably make a good feature . 
emphasis on the word " presumably . " 
_a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already-thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point--and that of viewers' patience levels . 
the first five minutes or so of _roxbury_ play very much like one of the original " roxbury guys " skits . 
with " what is love ? " 
blaring on the soundtrack , the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi ( chris kattan and will ferrell ) bob their heads , scope out " hotties " at clubs , and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts . 
there is one crucial difference , however--these guys speak . 
that little fact has been used as justification for the film's existence , that the butabis' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters . 
the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren , ferrell , and kattan are new , that's for sure , but they all lead to comic dead ends . 
there is no story per se , only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots . 
the brothers literally run into ( or , rather , get run into , as in by car ) richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ fame , and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club . 
there , they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri , conspicuously uncredited--can you blame him ? ) , who takes an interest in an idea of theirs . 
meanwhile , the bros' overbearing father ( dan hedaya ) wants them to stop clubbing . 
when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father , a rift is created between the two . 
the narrative messiness of _roxbury_ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny , but virtually none of it is . 
the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film , with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end . 
alas , the joke--a rather lazy takeoff on _jerry_maguire_--will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film . 
granted , a lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film's best joke is completely dependent on one's familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_'s lack of inspiration . 
that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves . 
like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_ , " the roxbury guys " is a one-joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context . 
after watching one of the " roxbury " skits on snl , this is what you come away with from the characters : they bob their heads to " what is love ? " , 
bump unsuspecting women , and . . . that's all . 
after watching _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ , you'll be left with exactly the same .
