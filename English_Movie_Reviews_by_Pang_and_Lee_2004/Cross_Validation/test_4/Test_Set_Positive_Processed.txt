plot young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon to whom he devoted tribute band in which he sings gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place critique sucker for movies like this young man with humble background and lofty dreams works hard devotes the time the energy and the patience and ultimately hits it big time in the case of this film our boy loves certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it yup luck always finds its way into these types of equations although generally tied very closely to hard work they need new singer his entry and adaptation to the whole rock roll lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch although will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love or past love of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it metal was one of my first loves as teen and even though the genre of music isn that prominent anymore still check out my motley crue twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again that not to say that you won like this film if you don like the music but the music and live performances from the band play big part in the movie and for one had blast watching and listening to it all but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg wow hand this fella some major props as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek god incidentally metal god was the film original title and much better one if you ask me he is this movie and was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through he came off like regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend and the romance angle between them was sweet but she didn pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes was also impressed by some of the real musicians who played in the film zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne jeff pilson from dokken stephan jenkins from third eye blind blas elias from slaughter but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members it to note that this film was based on real life tale of young man who used to sing in judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer their original singer also admitted to being gay as in this film just for the record certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies but because it fun uplifting well paced movie with solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances oh yeah and for those who dig the heavier side of music the soundtrack also rocks you see dreams can come true where joblo coming from almost famous 10 blow 10 boogie nights 10 detroit rock city 10 girlfight 10 goodfellas 10 10
unzipped is cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi an artist whose palette is fabric ostensibly the film is documentary but use of that term requires stretching its meaning many scenes appear staged and great deal of cutting and pasting has been done in the editing room the cinema verite effect is conceit genuine spontaneity is at premium and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera especially would be actresses like cindy crawford director douglas keeve who was mizrahi lover at the time freely admits that he couldn care less about the truth but was more interested in capturing the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion despite violating nearly every rule of legitimate documentary film making however unzipped is remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment while it sheds only little light on the behind the scenes world of the fashion industry it presents fascinating if incomplete picture of designer mizrahi this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study he funny energetic and eminently quotable he has unusual views on just about everything from fashion it about women not wanting to look like cows to mary tyler moore between her and jackie kennedy they shaped this country to style it almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs unzipped also gives glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into dress it almost certainly different that anyone would imagine the designer draws on variety of sources for his look including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies then enlists the aid of ouija board to help form the collection in particular unzipped traces mizrahi development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show which highlights number of prominent models including cindy crawford naomi campbell kate bush and linda evangelista on the technical side number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped variety of film stocks were used super 16 mm black and white and 35 mm color there is purpose to this beyond simple artiness the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie and during the climactic fashion show color is used to show the audience perspective while black and white is for the behind the scenes sequences nevertheless some viewers will be put off by this treatment while unzipped isn an expose on the fashion industry per se keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear overall however this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed when the designer declares that everything is frustrating except designing clothes that beautiful and liberating it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed
at first glance it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of year olds that true of home alone and bet money that it true of home alone opening soon but home alone actually has lot going for it and the cartoon slapstick doesn get in the way the mcalisters all 15 of them are going to france for the holidays four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse the littlest kid kevin is the victim of the older kids cruelty kevin patience runs out when he learns that his plain cheese pizza has already been eaten and he going to have to starve he attacks his big bully brother buzz who had been teasing him the fight disrupts the already chaotic dinner spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table few cousins and an uncle the knee jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased but they all point their fingers when he fights back the ultimate punishment comes from mom catherine hara who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night on his way up the stairs he tells her that families suck and that he hopes never to see any of his family again that night the power goes out knocking out the alarm clocks so the mcalisters wake up in big hurry to get to the airport in surprisingly plausible setup kevin is mistakenly accounted for and the family heads off without him it interesting that in subtle way his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling and second they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class they re two thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing child meanwhile kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true he finally rid of his family life is dream come true he can jump on the beds watch rated movies eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips and dig through his big brother secret box slowly the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane he grooms himself he does the laundry he goes shopping bought some milk eggs and fabric softener he also starts to miss his family not just for their company but for the security they bring the furnace in the basement is scary monster the old man next door is snow shovel murderer and two crooks are trying to break into his house macaulay culkin is cute but he isn much of an actor still we can see that kevin character grows thanks to some good direction and editing for example acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out seasonal santa at night just as santa is getting in his car kevin asks the man to pass on his request he wants his family back to the real santa he learned how to deal with the furnace you turn on the lights and it not so scary anymore he goes to church one evening and there he sees the snow shovel murderer who actually turns out to be nice man they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid finally in the last 20 minutes kevin confronts his last fear the bandits head on literally this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick and after the movie genuine dramatic setup it is dessert it lot of fun and it doesn overwhelm the rest of the movie on the whole home alone is great holiday movie john williams original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings but it does have its flaws the smallest problem is that culkin doesn act very well as said before he is cute but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin insight into his character the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda the villains threaten kevin life about five times instead of gonna get that kid they say gonna kill that kid some might argue that the tone is the same but strongly disagree mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is sociopathic faux pas ll probably never see home alone and wish had skipped home alone but do enjoy home alone almost every year don let your impressions of the others detract from the original which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick
why do so many children films treat their target audience with utter contempt too many of those who write or direct for children movies assume that the kids just can handle serious thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues the iron giant which was directed and co written by brad bird late of such animated series as the simpsons and king of the hill assumes that not only can children handle such discussions but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time the iron giant holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience making it film that enjoyable for both children and adults alike hogarth hughes voice of eli marienthal is spirited young lad who lives with his hard working single mother annie jennifer aniston in small town in maine after staying up late and watching scary movies on night his mother is away hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception he comes across giant robot vin diesel from space that eats metal for food after saving the robot nicknamed the iron giant from electric shock hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as pet of sorts because of damage he suffered upon landing the giant has forgotten what his original mission was so he just follows hogarth around like lost puppy realizing he can just keep the giant in barn all the time and that the giant needs food he takes him to junkyard owned by dean harry connick jr an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can keep the giant secret forever because government spook named kent mansley christopher mcdonald has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant threat to national security he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant and takes up residence in hogarth house as lodger meanwhile the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be weapon of some kind the iron giant is exactly what family films ought to be because it doesn talk down to its audience the story is simple very simple about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends young boy it very similar to the spielberg classic and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of the iron giant the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg film such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy the film delivers several serious messages the most important of which is one ability to choose one own fate hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be hero the final sequence is touching and appropriate though won give it away will say that very few will be disappointed the animation while not up to disney standards what could be after tarzan is good enough to make you forget you re watching cartoon the giant is computer animated while the human characters are all hand drawn the old fashioned way the characters faces are done quite well drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother harry connick jr does nice characterization as dean and really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney of tv frasier as an army general called in by agent mansley unlike several cartoon features each character is actually developed personality rather than stereotype and is actually integral to the plot rather than being superfluous comic relief sidekick clich disney still hasn ditched dean for example could have been stereotypical beatnik his character profile seems to suggest that but he is presented as character with real emotions thoughts and motivations even the heavy agent mansley is not villain who does bad things simply because he wants to but out of his own fear and paranoia lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper thin stereotypes and figure the kids won mind but the iron giant has clearly put little work into making the characters real and it pays off the film isn only around to deliver heavy handed messages though it also very funny and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things such as dive into pool are handled well and director brad bird clearly has sense of comic timing having worked on the simpsons for many years sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to outlast one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed and also extremely clever the film even takes some jabs at america nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to duck and cover in the event of nuclear attack the iron giant has much more of satirical edge to it than most family films and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing instead of seeing people get bonked on the head we get well timed clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with when you get right down to it the iron giant is no more than the story of boy and his robot the story is so straightforward so quaint that it ultimately becomes charming though enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person when it comes to family entertainment simple is the way to go it akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word but it not the story that sets the film above others of its kind but rather the elements that go into the story namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue which the iron giant has in spades
big surprise to me the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off but making blues brothers movie without jake blues john belushi is such dumb idea really had no hope they replaced him just fine not with john goodman he didn do much of anything but with the brilliant actor joe morton who can really sing the fourth blues brother is evan bonifant who ten this was another of my fears for the film but he really good dancer and plays mean harmonica although he may have been dubbed things that intellectually had bothered me before like no mission from god everyone being richer it not being filmed in chicago gave me no problems at all quite pleased that there were less car pile ups because they meant less music and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing there few early crashes and then one huge pile up but after that it all stops it just the music one of my problems with the first is that cab calloway song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him but there no problems with this the music is all as good as ever tons of great musicians showing up with the exception of johnny lang who can sing all the musicians do great job the only real problems had was the special effects these were superfluous and waste of money since the film isn doing very well they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel which want to see the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide http www geocities com hollywood academy 8034 remove no spam to reply drive carefully but recklessly mama child toy the only excercise take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise peter toole
as walked out of crouching tiger hidden dragon thought to myself that had had just seen great film with the passage of few hours tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether masterpiece must implicitly be great piece of work and viceversa attempting to make distinction may be matter of splitting hairs avoided commitment by appealing to etymology as the word implies masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of master as such it should suffice to say that it is product of exceptional quality crouching tiger hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category crouching tiger hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore with the requisite blend of legend fantasy magic and mythology it is reminiscent of wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half gods greater than life purer than life stronger than life physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats but with human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop with advanced masters of each and golden pupil which must choose between the two it is the gifted pupil who under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment pair of masters and pair of youngsters are poignantly represented the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours de force not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art as are the prodigious leaps and flights to from and between rooftops the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of lake there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry as in wagnerian opera there is substantial story line which takes place at an ordinary human level yet the entire project is to be accepted as work of art rooted in fantasy do not assume however that the art is limp wristed for those who are put off by the art label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure action and romance there are no weak performances in this movie michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth humanity and wisdom chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart zhang ziyi is budding superstar she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in multifaceted role cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably kudos to screenwriters james schamus wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing choreographer yuen wo ping photography director peter pau and music director tan dun each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film ang lee as the director co producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit this is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes including those who hate martial arts movies don miss it
on re watching italian writer director dario argento much lauded murder mystery tenebrae was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as storyteller and manages to get away with in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his giallo murder mysteries while it certainly not perfect repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller the story follows promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal anthony franciosa where he discovers that serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book tenebrae with the police on his back for leads he decides to take personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into mystery where all is not as it seems the film benefits enormously from fine central performance by franciosa he brings grace charm and deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real life horror around him the film is awash with fascinating psychosexual tension argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral ambivalent shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become dangerous business tenebrae is perhaps the most multi layered of argento scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red profondo rosso the full length italian language version and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes needless to say for argento fans there is no denying the director brilliance as stylist many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep kirmizi and suspiria instead tenebrae set design and lighting paints sleek clinical chilly vision of vaguely futuristic urban world and the soundtrack mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment so tenebrae has much to recommend it no question still constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative some critics argue that logic doesn matter in argento films but damnit it matters in all films to the point where viewers don deserve to feel cheated by the way if you don want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which properly handled could have proved ingenious we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by man who we later discover is none other than the author peter neal he is insane apparently the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife he is finally revealed to us as this second killer in the film bloody climax but argento muffs the twist both technically and narratively you see we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer house but thanks to poor editing its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway bad cutting puts the timing way out in other words he almost in two places at once during this crucial scene we are also thrown ridiculous kirmizi herring by the film end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self inflicted nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by fleeing assailant the injury he banged himself on the head with bloody great rock thus the revelation of the hero as killer and anti hero in the final scenes may still prove shocking but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled helpfully in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along but there too is problem as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least the story owes us better understanding of franciosa mind his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies for instance teenage boy and girl leave hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of motorbike we would assume the rider is the same boy but it turns out to be some male character we aren even introduced too that careless filmmaking pure and simple why you may ask do go on about the story flaws because when it comes to visuals and set pieces argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts guard dog to the point where almost unbelievably it jumps high fence and chases her across town finally as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer lair it an absolutely masterful sequence tense and exciting and communicating wealth of information through visuals alone and that exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating too often it seems argento films as whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts mind you if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth look and if you re fan of argento unique style of giallo thriller then it essential see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli it stylish great looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative shame because it doesn have to be that way take argento more recent stendhal syndrome 1992 where with the aid of co writer franco ferrini he fashioned solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache proof that he can do it if he tries
it rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in single year but that is what disney and pixar animation latest film represents while bugs life isn nearly as deep as it predecessor dreamwork antz it is just as funny bug life centers appropriately around the life of an ant named flik flik cutely voiced by newsradio david foley hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost the leaders of the colony send him out on mission too get him out of the way the offering is food that vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission they never dream he will be successful they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food flik mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs who he mistakenly assumes are warriors when he returns with the `warriors the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes bug life has animation that is simply stunning the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative together with the great voice acting this film is the perfect holiday family film its main weakness is that it couldn beat antz to the theaters making it seem like stale material
know that funnest isn word fun is noun and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective but that the word that came to me right after viewing chicken run no wonder this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions like that was the funnest movie ve ever seen so to hell with webster chicken run is one of the funnest movies ve seen in while can remember the last time ve seen anything funner the chickens at tweedy farm are up to something living in concentration camp like atmosphere they are led by one plucky hen called ginger voice of julia sawalha who continually comes up with plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day in the coal box one night brash american rooster flies in over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides to abandon the farm egg selling plan for pie selling plan she orders huge pie making machine cackling chickens go in pies come out what sort of pies chicken pies of course co director nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscar winning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and close shave the latter two were the second and third installments of trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures part of what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was park uncanny ability to make an old story seem new the wrong trousers for example pulled out lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks and close shave owed great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories but in the hands of park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived now teaming with co director peter lord park has created similar creature in chicken run the plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for quick reference to the ball bouncing scene with some spielberg inspired action sequences providing the excitement thing is the film doesn feel like it been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done part of it is the original idea who in the world came up with the idea to make prisoners of war movie starring chickens park and lord milk the incongruity for all it worth the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious and to them it is but they re chickens so it funny to us another thing that helps chicken run and most of park films succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods to the very films they re cribbing there are references to the great escape obviously and stalag 17 the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom there even nod to the blues brothers if you can believe it and the filmmakers even get in little light hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson nationality and film history the braveheart reference is hoot if you catch it when you consider just how fine line resides between funny parody and redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in its execution consider this since july of last year ve seen dozens upon dozens of blair witch project parodies on television on the radio and online out of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome why because once you got past the thought that they re parodying that&#8216 blair witch movie most of the parodies had nothing to offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose they were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing conversely chicken run doesn lean on its parodies the film references are never the sole focus of any scene if you ve never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun even if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character park lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need parody shoved in their faces before it understood and as result chicken run is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either enjoyment of this movie doesn require knowledge of film history but if you ve got it chicken run is that much richer the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it hard not to fall in love with every one of them ginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but with soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known as the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nails it she has warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under brash gung ho veneer the characters inevitable romance doesn feel contrived but sweet poor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly isn any help jane horrocks delivers lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs hen that runs away with most of the best one liners all while perpetually crocheting sweater and two supply trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing dancing sequence they even come up with an inspired riff on something that baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken vs egg dilemma one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome but as with most of chicken run it comes as delightful surprise the film manages to cross all barriers it should be accessible to both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens the animation is first rate remember that this was all done the old fashioned way with actual humans moving clay figurines around on tiny set bit by painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great precise and unwavering attention to detail as in such top notch family fare as bug life or toy story chicken run has something to offer in nearly every frame certainly passive viewer can enjoy it as straightforward story with worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but active attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they ll catch all the details anyway the movie just boatload of fun funnest damn movie ve seen all year
have to say it tim burton retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than barrel of monkeys ok that off my chest no more monkey puns promise seriously though planet of the apes is one rip roarin summer outing filled with thrills action adventure wit and bits of funny dare say monkey business know know promised and for those film buffs who are fond of the original burton version includes couple tips of the hat to that movie mark wahlberg stars as capt leo davidson deep space pilot whose ship gets drawn into magnetic field and hurled into the future he crash lands on planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted captured and sold into slavery despite being darker than the original burton film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious some of the movie flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton an organ grinder ape with midget or an elderly ape taking off wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed then there are the parents who buy little girl as pet for there young daughter the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty one thing you don want in your house is human teen ager he says you don have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton brand lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian foot to try righting himself are take your stinking hand off of me you damned dirty human anyone familiar with the first version of the film will of course recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue another of burton in jokes is to have charlton heston star of the original play the chimpanzee father of tim roth gen thade the young chimp goes to visit his dying father both have one thing in common hatred of humans with his dying breath the elder spews out his vile damn them damn them all to hell he says before expiring that is the famous line heston taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet terrible secret the performances throughout are top notch wahlberg plays davidson not as some gung ho hero but as confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home he is reluctant to lead the human rebellion his only objective being to find way off this upside down planet this hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable roth is ferocious cunning cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity he leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet it is masterful turn helena bonham carter is ari the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals hers is smart compassionate characterization michael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo the ape slave trader making living off the misery of the humans he captures as the battle between apes and humans looms the cowardly limbo pleads can we all just get along echoing the words of rodney king much of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton technical crew especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup burton musical collaborator danny elfman provides another fine score though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow the movie only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original he comes close but falls short otherwise planet of the apes is what summer movie should be an amusement park ride filled with lots of action stunts and few laughs this is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre release hype

virtual reality is topic that has almost defined its own genre since dark city 1998 films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix all the films released after it have been less successful david cronenberg existenz released only couple of months after the matrix was accepted and even appreciated by some but the hype was gone and when the thirteenth floor aired this fall it was completely overseen and ignored admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying feeling like eating the same meal over and over again it was therefore was less than excited when went out to see to the thirteenth floor however was positively surprised by josef rusnak latest picture matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality combining the best of hollywood action and effects with an intelligent story existenz was violent gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality ending in blood and madness the thirteenth floor is somewhere in between instead of going after the crowds the action audience like the matrix or aiming at the horror fans like existenz the thirteenth floor presents more intelligent plot witch will provide less entertaining and more serious experience that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding in near future on the thirteenth floor of classified building genius scientist hannon fuller has created simulated world his personal dreamworld where every inhabitant is complex selflearning program that only believes it is real right after the first testing of this world fuller is found murdered douglas hall his closest friend and business partner immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth beautiful woman gretchen mol who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence the first download into simulation is impressive it is the creator first visit to his world his creation in order to enter this virtual universe you have to take over someone identity become another person this is called conciseness transfer and this is part of the tragedy in the film people wake up in unknown places and strange things start happen they start to doubt in their own sanity these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their users and creators with their sanity and their lives it is frightening reality the fact that all the people in the simulation the program links are living out their lives oblivious not knowing that they are puppets in someone fantasy with an appealing blade runner type of detective story this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present our modern world is metal and glass cold unfriendly impersonal the thirties are different colorful beautiful elegant virile this contrast demonstrates wish for change virtual reality is here portrayed as magical enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities to some it is just journey to their personal paradise to some personal playground life without any consequences for others way to start over and correct their mistakes by living in an illusion of their past virtual reality is wizard that transforms your hopes dreams and fantasies to life at least that how it is all beginning but when you re waking up from your dream the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise this almost narcotic effect soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised what is real what is thought who are we if these were answered this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made they are off course not answered but posed in an intelligent manner the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements since it portrays the contrast between these computer simulated universes kirk petrucelli has done marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour grace and color and setting this world in opposition to our own an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time rather unusual thing about the thirteenth floor is the almost complete lack of special effects there are no cgi animated creatures no bullets in slow motion this is more philosophical approach reminding about the european way of filmmaking this is off course major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians but the more serious science fiction buffs and dark city fans will be pleased this film is interesting and inspiring it has everything existenz doesn but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix and then there is happy end which like in dark city completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics including blade runner and dark city with this in mind the thirteenth floor doesn make an oscar candidate or film that will be remembered year from now yet this is beautiful elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality
with stars like sigourney weaver alien trilogy and academy award winner holly hunter the piano raising arizona etc together in single hollywood production one would immediately identify the film as potential academy award hot shot sadly for copycat though tightly scripted and nicely plot is still at heart typical hollywood thriller helen weaver after traumatic near death encounter with serial killer darryl harry connick jr has developed phobia for being outdoors so to speak incidentally helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers which make her juicy target for serial killer wannabes year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco detective monahan hunter and getz mulroney baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer seeks the professional help of helen who as expected was reluctant at first copycat borrows lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases it did work but copycat tries to be little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also much of the time wasted could ve been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama even so weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments weaver being the vulnerable yet strong within character as in aliens and hunter being the short tough texan speaking cop as in raising arizona harry connick jr very good jazz singer shines as the imprisoned serial killer la hannibal lecter which comes to the moment of judgement drum roll please copycat is good thriller although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats in anticipation of the killers next immediate move this worked pretty well and will offer audiences couple of unexpected jolts nice movie to bring your girlfriend to
you ve got to love disney no matter what they serve up it is guaranteed success as long as it animated kids have to go see the movie then they have to get the toys oh the video came out got to buy it or risk little billy temper tantrums for the next month all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of pilgrimage to mecca visit to the magic kingdom stay at the disneyland hotel buy disney shirt eat an ice cream mickey mouse on stick it both vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it dale carnegie should have had it so good what most amazing is that all this success is in spite of severe lack of originality you see disney animated features these days have two components theme and plot the theme changes with each new movie the plot does not the plot is mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same however while the success of disney animated feature is generally given as far as box office receipts merchandising dollars and glimmers in the eyes of little children critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer luckily disney latest animated offering mulan manages to be engaging and refreshing even while rife with formula the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns led by the imposing shan yu miguel ferrer soon china emperor pat morita mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china defense when the fa family is served notice it is the elderly father fa zhou soon tek oh who must answer the call as there are no other males in the household fearing her father will surely be killed in battle fa mulan ming na wen disguises herself as man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army mulan based on chinese epic poem is classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling mulan herself is disgrace to her loving family as she has difficult time fitting into the traditional woman role and in very amusing scene where matchmaker attempts to assess her value to potential husband we see that grace is not one of her strong points very early on we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one family and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker mulan fails at that task by leaving home to fight in her father place she may not only spare his life but bring honor too as is the case with most disney musicals the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film not sure if they will get much airplay but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time both lea salonga who provides the singing voice for mulan and donny osmond who sings for shang the captain of mulan army unit and obligatory love interest are more than competent although salonga voice translates much better to animation you have to hear it to understand interestingly the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan there is no significantly big number which is customary as the second or third song in disney film but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie it is however an expectation which has been built by disney own formulaic history and some viewers may feel as if something is missing artistically the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works it helps to contribute more authentic and therefore more credible nature to what otherwise may be seen as typically disneyfied ethnic tale there are also couple of visually standout scenes one involving the charge of shan yu hun army which utilizes the same computer enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it when mulan resolves to take her father place she dons her father old battle armor and unsheathes sword as she does so you can see her reflection in the polished metal it just left me thinking that was really cool wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film varying from the straight such as soon tek oh as fa zhou to the comical such as harvey fierstein as yao gruff pugilistic member of shang conscripted army even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance found the choice of wong as shang little strange you may remember him as martin short wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast so guess anything possible in any event wong performs admirably as well one character which provides significant amount of humor is grandmother fa she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people june foray who supplies grandmother fa speaking voice is venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale as in boris and natasha marni nixon who provides grandmother fa singing voice is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and maria in west side story and eliza in my fair lady with this in mind hearing grandmother fa is like listening to little piece of history mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films in an effort to be culturally sensitive and to avoid miss saigon type debacle disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian american actors for both lead and supporting roles in addition to the actors already mentioned the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong gedde watanabe james shigeta and george takei guess clyde kusatsu wasn available at running time of slightly under an hour and half mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and happily adults this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next rather than hope that the next one is better
capsule suprisingly more of comedy than straight action flick which isn necessarily bad thing not exactly oscar caliber but one helluva bullet riddled good time extended review you know remember when hitmen were evil murderous scum alas the times are changin in recent string of movies hitmen are suddenly wise cracking fun loving killers with hearts this brings us to hong kong director kirk wong first american feature the big hit oddly enough about the same time last year similar film grosse point blank was released advertised as quirky comedy with hints of action it turned out to have suprising dosage of it the big hit is quite the opposite it was hyped as the new film from producer john woo so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action however there sore lack of it which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit the film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing job on beyaz slaver mel played by mark wahlberg in dopey milquetoast role is killing machine he flips spins even breakdances whilst popping caps sadly he doesn get chance to do much of it except for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so the film is in comedy mode the action at least what there is of it is prime cut stuff wong after numerous hong kong features makes quite nice debut however his pacing is bit off with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough they start off electrifying and fresh but just kinda stop normally this would hamper movie to the point of being unenjoyable luckily we have ben ramsey screenplay bitingly funny piece of work the only problem is there might be too much humor one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few some of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mel hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism the only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled some being there only for laugh which sometimes works sometimes doesn overall the big hit may have it flaws but it makes up for them in stylishly directed gut wrenchingly funny joyride definately one of the better ways to spend two hours
being john malkovich is the type of film we need to see more today films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas or those that have similar themes malkovich falls under none of these categories and it quite refreshing to see that occur this strangely provoking story is actually somewhat understandable john cusack plays puppeteer trying to make it to the big time his wife cameron diaz supports the both of them by working at petstore which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment when cusack finally realizes he needs to get job he finds an ad for filing clerk when he reaches the building he arrives at floor it there that he discovers secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for 15 minutes at time meanwhile cusack meets business partner catherine keener in which he falls madly in love with her the only problem is she has no interest in him what so ever the whole portal thing isn just toy in fact it becomes cusack dream being inside malkovich mind gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich like puppet and to fulfill his fantasies don want to give away too much but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery in my opinion this idea is absolutely brilliant it really quite scary to think that someone could become you control you be you it makes you wonder why we act like we do and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the mavi even if the script is super sharp can help but find the ending displeasing it could have lead up to something more or at least an amusing conclusion it tried to explain mythology about the portals that made it seem rushed other than that had very enjoyable time the acting was quite delightful as well john cusack has finally been given chance to prove his ability and he does it well he by far the most underrated actor due to lack of popularity but hoping that will change cameron diaz was her usual charming self although felt that part was wrong for her but she pulled it off john malkovich himself continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice who else mind would be better to explore the director spike jonze who appeared in last month three kings really catches my attention with this project knew he was bizzare but not to this extreme he too is likely too receive media attention being john malkovich isn an excellent film but it is definitly entertaining and will eaisly become cult favorite what even better is the film puzzling message am nick lyons
the tailor of panama is different kind of spy movie despite the presence of pierce brosnan there is nary hint of james bond flash here instead of big action scenes leering super villains and empty headed femme fatales we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation based on the novel by john le carr who also co wrote the screenplay the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year solid well told story brosnan plays andy osnard british operative walking on thin ice his british superiors ship him off to panama making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co workers and his new home base when shown the bridge of the americas by person marveling over the fact that since the creation of the panama canal the structure is the sole connection between north and south america he barely keeps from yawning brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 investing the suave spy with distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end searching for way to get information on the government osnard sets his sights on harry pendel geoffrey rush an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite harry claims to be transplant from britain renowned saville row but osnard knows his secret the tailor is an ex con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle shop in an insurance scam he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt having spent fortune on an unsuccessful farm osnard offers harry way out he will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele eager to comply harry offers what he knows then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing before long he is forced to spy on his loving wife louisa jamie lee curtis an aide to the canal director harry little lies build eventually taking on life of their own osnard turns in reports about the silent opposition group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal the bogus revelation proves explosive leading to meetings in washington over how to best protect the vital waterway meanwhile osnard wallows in his newfound status enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co worker and harry grows ever more fretful fearing the consequences if his clients not to mention his wife learn about his lies geoffrey rush is wonderful as harry fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor rush makes harry credible figure presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity after gaining fame playing larger than life characters rush flips everything around for this role using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems although she gets far too little screen time jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with depth greater than the screenplay provides her of the central characters she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self confidence curtis is one of my favorite female actors whiplash smart sultry and charismatic she deserves more than supporting roles speaking of supporting characters there are some great ones here harold pinter is amusing as harry uncle benny who pops up throughout the story in number of creative ways also shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as corrupt banker and dylan baker who is riot as united states general straight out of the dr strangelove school of armed patriotism but the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson both outstanding as two wounded activists their presence adds weight to the story reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal director john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location instead of using panama city merely as colorful backdrop he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there the metropolis described by one character as casablanca without heroes pulsates with life underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have disastrous impact on great many people the tailor of panama succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than simple entertainment
this is film about secrets some that are innocent like those of cute little farm girl frances boyd ashley others that are between married couple that is impacting their relationship like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple geoffrey gaines stephen ramsey the medical researcher working for big corporation called fex and striving to get patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field and his artist wife lillian miriam healy louie who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work and still other secrets that have greater implication for the world and are deadly in political sense of science carried out by the big corporations like it was business run for the bottom line receiving summer grant to study chemo electric therapy geoffrey and his wife are hoping that summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together as their three year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab which is off limits to her as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses his main argument is that this is what the public wants they don want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments they just want the benefits of science that he is depicted as monster creating another monster much like frankenstein was created is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science science as business as opposed to the good science science that cares about the small farmer which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman alex vine david young ecologist who chooses to work in the field trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming methods that have just come about in the last thirty years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins the third view in all this is the artist represented by lillian who points out that the artist work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly why shouldn the same be true of the scientist she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public questioning what is good or evil in society something that bad science has completely ignored geoffrey impatient to get ahead with his research feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on as he contacts one of the company higher ups to argue his case but decides he can wait any longer for their help so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester the gorgeous pet dog of frances dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life while out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car he is spotted by alex and one of his co workers and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife afraid that alex will spot what he is doing as he rushes away from the area in the dinner scene that was unfortunately flatly done but was nevertheless the heart of the film as all the main characters get chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything the scientists engage in rational argument highlighting their different points of view while lillian reacts in an emotional way siding mostly with david view but coming at it from much different angle it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies that the director point of view is absolutely right is beside the point the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one dimensional characters geoffrey was likened to hideous monster alex vine was likened to his last name the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art the inspiration for goodness and beauty alex has been spending lot of time together with lillian as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex apartment geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely the dog is discovered by alex and her in deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it and mercifully the dog dies the only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage but she also fails to respond to david loving gesture for her to stay with him instead opting to head back to the city the farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of phone conversation with one of the higher ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way what is progress what can one expect out of life is the small farmer about to become extinct the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art which are both closely related to the american natives vision of world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in peaceful way that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions leaving no room for deeper arguments is the shame of this decent and smart film that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so siyah and beyaz no telling said lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic there is something about listening to lecture that turns off the rebel in me as don like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically that is not to say that found the film without considerable merit that inspite of its shortcomings it was worth seeing because of its visual statements though they were also not too subtle they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is mental war going on currently of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene it was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso guernica had for him both artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on the pain that lillian feels as she forgets about her desires to raise family and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song make the world go away blares out from the background after she has learned that frances beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of husband all in the name of science had raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science perhaps the most pertinent question the film asks requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business as the question becomes can science be happily married with art
one of the best things about my job is that every so often film still catches me by surprise spy kids certainly did an adventure story aimed primarily at children the movie is smart zippy fun the production neither panders nor talks down to its audience the brother and sister at the center of the tale are believable likable kids and their parents are get ready for this intelligent capable and loving bathroom humor is kept to minimum and the numerous well staged action scenes avoid excessive violence what relief it is to be able to review an all ages film on its artistic merits and not its ethics consider the other pg rated family friendly movie in theaters now see spot run has mother going out of town leaving her son with an idiot neighbor body function humor abounds including slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop what really disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film the story begins with police dog capturing mobster and biting off one of his testicles in the process at the hospital the doctors explain that they replaced the testicle with metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog didn bit off the other one because two metal replacement balls would clack together of course the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells somebody clue me in when did genital mutilation become funny spy kids is welcome antidote to the repellent see spot run using imagination instead of cruelty and crudeness carmen alexa vega and her younger brother juni daryl sabara live in beautiful seaside home with their parents gregorio antonio banderas and ingrid cortez carla gugino mom and dad are sultry couple devoted to their children what the kids don know is that they are also former spies once agents from different countries assigned to erase each other they instead fell in love married and retired to raise family needless to say they get drawn back to the business shortly into their first joint mission they are captured and end up in the headquarters of fegan floop alan cumming foppish hybrid of willy wonka and pee wee herman who hosts juni favorite tv show but there is evil behind the scenes as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children papa gregorio has the device necessary to radically increase the efficiency of the creatures and the bad guys will stop at nothing to get it from him back at home uncle felix cheech marin shows up to reveal mom and dad secret to the kids after brief respite at safe house filled with enough cool gadgets for dozen sharper image stores carmen and juni set off to find their parents and save the world zooming through the sea in submarine pod that looks like goldfish while slew of wicked people including teri hatcher chase them during the course of their adventures they get to use jet packs electroshock bubblegum and super computer sunglasses they watch as secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with silly putty faces and used as background characters on floop tv show they deal with guards that have huge thumbs where their arms legs and heads would normally be why are the guards so ineffective because they re all thumbs they move from one colorful locale to another including nifty virtual reality room reminiscent of the holodeck from star trek the storyline is silly and convoluted but even at its most dense it is easier to follow than either mission impossible movie director robert rodriguez from dusk to dawn maintains frenetic pace with the whole film clocking in at mere 86 minutes bit less action and little more character development would have been nice but he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully invested in the family alexa vega and daryl sabara make an agreeable brother and sister team squabbling the way kids do but coming together when it counts antonio banderas and carla gugino are even better as the parents they quickly establish and maintain great lusty chemistry while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes even the usually irritating alan cumming has some nice moments virtual cloud backed chat between his character and juni is one of the best segments in the film had rodriguez added few more scenes like that would have enjoyed the film more and definitely could have lived without the glaring product placement for certain mc ubiquitous company regardless spy kids is hoot offering fun for adults and children alike and just think they managed to do it without sacrificing single testicle
of all the films ve come to see this year 1997 think only chasing amy had as many laugh out loud moments not saying that was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman but my mouth burst open with at least delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes and think the kind of person that laughs least at movies even when find them funny usually all you can get out of me is warm smile so to get me laughing out loud and so frequently is really good sign waiting for guffman is the story of blaine missouri town celebrating it 150th anniversary and the musical that is being put on for the big event the play is being directed by corky st clair christopher guest who also wrote and directed this mockumentary as well as co writing several original musical numbers the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production smashing success teaming up with st clair are handful of blaine residents allan pearl eugene levy jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown but sitting right next to him and studying him ron and sheila albertson fred willard and catherine hara respectively married couple setting their sights on hollywood libby mae brown parker posey the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen and few others everybody in this movie is brilliant absolutely so but levy particularly stands out these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can help but love them as pathetic as they really are although levy stands out guest willard hara and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances if there was an oscar for an ensemble performance this is the group that should sweep it some humor was tad uneven from the rest of the film and even after starting very humorously they nearly lost me with the tad too long intros as delightful as it was it began to get monotonous thankfully just as your about to say ok maybe should run to the bathroom they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes like play this film gives very three act feel the intros funny but almost too long the rehearsals even funnier and finally the actual performance of the play excellent like said each character really shines even when done with subtle approach you can really watch these people and not think they re real people even they way they talk with awkward pauses and stumbles that don feel staged at all you feel like you re watching real albeit funny documentary and even with silly lyrics the original songs when the play is finally put on are absolutely wonderful as word of note despite it rating waiting for guffman is really quite clean this rating came from brief very brief use of the grand daddy of all swear words even if that really bothers you let me say that it not presented in vulgar cheap laugh way it actually quite humorous and tastefully done it might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting for guffman it silly humor but it also so dry subtle and intelligently done that you re not insulted by it it always really nice to see comedy that isn all slapstick and vulgarity and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones recommend seeing it
the dream team is thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane billy played by michael keaton is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble christopher lloyd portrays henry an obsessive compulsive who requires that everything be neat orderly on schedule and by the books he thinks he doctor so he walks around wearing suit and carrying clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports jack played by peter boyle thinks he jesus and finally there stephen furst as albert chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the four some when their psychiatrist dr weitzman takes them out of the hospital for field trip to yankee stadium during pit stop they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan the movie charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast the four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively they never miss an opportunity to argue bicker or insult one another henry and jack for example fight over who going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game the actors in the dream team have lot of fun with their characters and with each other michael keaton is well cast as billy he gives his cynical character considerable complexity as the divinely jack peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one dimensional character funny and fresh although stephen furst catatonic character is cliched the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing while keaton boyle and furst are good it christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance his body language for example the way he walks and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character lloyd brilliant performance yields pathetic moving and memorable character the dream team is solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise the characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot
find most of television so intensely boring that simply never turn on my set unless watching movie don even have cable so went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching the files every sunday night it the only show that worth an hour of my time each week though since don watch reruns glad that have six months of the year to avoid television altogether am an avid fan of the show and have been for about three years now and love gillian anderson the files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off the film is like two hour episode except that there are lot more special effects the plot is thicker and the resolution is more satisfying this is terrific film both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment expected to like it more than any episode ve seen and my expectations were met actually the film takes few risks in its story and plot devices but thankfully the makers managed to do it right when the finale ended the fbi branch known as the files had been destroyed and our heroes mulder david duchovny and scully gillian anderson were left stripped of five years of hard work the film picks up soon after and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating bomb threat in federal building but wait getting ahead of myself the film actually opens in the ice age about 32 000 years prior during which couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by vicious alien the alien blood infects them fans of the show will certainly remember the siyah cancer and the story jumps into modern times during which young boy is also infected with the cancer it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy and mulder and scully uncover the cover up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi soon they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens as ve written before it not easy to write plot summaries for films like this because everything needs to be surprise fans of the show will know what to expect and seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film director rob bowman has done great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television there are some truly suspenseful and well created scenes here late in the film when they re in the alien spacecraft you ll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema the special effects are very good and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic what find interesting is that the files is actually great way for series neophytes to get into the story our heroes are given subtle introductions we re not expected to know them on the outset and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn required to understand the film there are of course little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans but ll keep those as surprises it takes lot of thought and understanding of the series to create film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides and then create coherent film that anyone can understand clearly the series is strong for lot of reasons it original though it has many ties to the twilight zone and owes some homage to hitchcock and impressively eerie for television show what really makes the series shine however are the actors duchovny has so much presence and is just fun guy to watch he has that confidence that will someday make him into bankable leading man anderson is equally good and paralyzingly beautiful she also strong actress both performers have acted in little more than their series however though think they ll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon enthusiastically recommend the files both for fans and non fans 1998 is summer filled with disappointing blockbusters and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry it an intelligent film and takes you places that you might not have been or at least might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar the files is impressive in concept as well fans of the series are likely to be highly critical and to take the premise beyond the series is risky move it nice to see risk pay off for change actually it nice to see risk at all
synopsis shrek myers is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in the heart of forest until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the rule of the evil lord farquaad john lithgow farquaad agrees to relocate the pests on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona diaz whom farquaad desires to wed from far off castle grudgingly shrek sets out joined in his quest by an unwanted companion donkey murphy review one memorable aspect of disney aladdin was that it finally gave robin williams character the genie to best take advantage of his comic talents shrek does the same for eddie murphy ironically though murphy ideal vessel turns out to be an ass all the same shrek does represent murphy best comic outing in years and as donkey he steals all the best lines for instance after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as magical creature donkey soars into the air and scoffs now flying talking donkey and despite its many contributors the script for shrek is full of such comic gems myers is delightful in more of straight man role and lithgow also gets some great moments watch for hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man shrek takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts and reserves few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain things do go somewhat astray during the film middle segment which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie greatest strength but even then one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology
the full monty is whole lot of fun its wacky witty and original it written and directed by relatively unknowns simon beaufoy and peter cattaneo who both turned up oscar nominations how did this movie with budget under 10 million gross over 175 million worldwide its been rumored that this film may be the second most profitable movie of the year and to think its about male exotic dancers and not sinking ships six steel workers who have been recently been laid off and are all looking for jobs inspired by the success of chippendale production gaz robert carlyle decides they should all put on strip show to make some money quickly as the six team up to put on the show of their lives they run into few problems for instance dave mark addy is worried about his weight horse paul barber thinks he may be inadequate and gerald tom wilkinson is worried about his reputation and timing so when the night of the show comes will the men be able to do the full monty as said before this is fun movie and not just that its really artistically good the writing and direction are great the acting is appealing all the performances have human quality to them so you can relate to at least one of the characters the full monty received four oscar nominations including best picture which left me wondering one thing why didn trainspotting get best picture nomination last year while the full monty is great lighthearted comedy it doesn carry the social impact of the brilliant trainspotting still the full monty is great film must see
like the wonderful 1990 drama awakenings starring robin williams and robert de niro at first sight directed by irwin winkler is inspired by true story documented by physicfirst sight directed by irwin winkler is inspired by true story documented by physician oliver sacks since awakenings was so very good and made my top ten list the year it was released at first sight is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure hand as penny marshall but is still an intelligent and vibrantly acted drama the film begins as amy mira sorvino stressed out new york architect decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country at the hotel she is staying at she makes massage appointment and after long soothing session which ends with her crying as release of emotions she strikes up conversation with the handsome masseur virgil val kilmer only to find out later that he is actually blind amy doesn really care if he has handicap or not and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love once she has returned to new york amy begins to research on virgil certain type of retinal blindness which he has had since three years of age and out of stroke of luck comes into contact with doctor bruce davison who believes he can repair virgil sight even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history at first reluctant virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery much to the hesitance of his overbearing but loving older sister kelly mcgillis ultimately the surgery is success but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees since he has never visually seen anything before only touched objects he moves into amy apartment and she is eager to stand by him but virgil maladjustment begins to put strain on their relationship on the basis of the overall story at first sight is indeed film that has been done many times before and owes great deal to its predecessor awakenings what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance however what helps at first sight rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy usually romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy dog sort the recent tom hanks meg ryan starrer you ve got mail immediately pops to mind but with this film grew to care more about the characters and their plight the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil the massaging sequences were strangely erotic maybe even more so than the later actual love scenes and as their romantic involvement quickly developed the film was both entertaining and sweet and there was clearly lot of chemistry between the two these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to contrast in the life styles that they have always known with virgil completely used to being blind and having comforting peaceful life in the country to amy eventful life in the big city the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board val kilmer usually cast in the macho type of role was always believable as blind person and playing his character was probably little more tricky than it appears it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity but to sympathize with and he pulled it off mira sorvino who made spectacular debuting splash in 1995 hilarious woody allen comedy mighty aphrodite for which she won well deserved oscar as kind hearted but ditzy hooker is standout here although she has made some mediocre film choices since then 1997 mimic 1998 the replacement killers she always has managed to come out unscathed and it is with at first sight that she finally has another juicy role to play in truthful climactic scene set in amy apartment between she and virgil sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today and has flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces kelly mcgillis who could have easily come off as the bad one dimensional sister instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother finally nathan lane who is usually little too over the top is appropriately restrained as vision therapist the one misstep of at first sight is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil very little is ever said or discussed concerning it and when the surgery occurs it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences but would personally take realism even if it is graphic any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder in awakenings the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed because of how strong the screenplay written by steve levitt is in the way it deals with the main relationship and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino the film few problems can be swept over to the side the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is no doubt in respect to the real life couple that the film was inspired by who are still together after many years even though the setting of the film was changed to new york since january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies at first sight comes as refreshing and sophisticated change of pace
leonardo decaprio what eating gilbert grape and claire danes tv my so called life star in director baz luhrmann modernized version of william shakespeare classic romeo juliet surrounded by superb supporting cast in cluding paul sorvino goodfellas brian dennehy tommy boy pete poslethwaite the usual sus pects and john leguizamo executive decision decaprio and danes shine throughout the film the story starts off at gas station where the montague boys meet the capulet boys and square off with one another symbolizing the swords of shakespeare day were their weapons like the rapier 9mm or the longsword shotgun instead of killing each other right away they shoot around just like in sword fights of old another great thing about the film was the performance of harold perrineau as romeo best friend mercutio who in shakespeare novel was quite stud was portrayed as an afri can american cross dresser whose violent na ture was definite plus miriam margoyles virtually unknown actress was astounding as juliet nurse even though she was never given name she was the only one who could keep juliet out of her fantasy world verona was the home of the rival families in shakespeare version only slightly changed in luhrmann now known as verona beach the capulet led by sorvino and montague led by dennehy are now rival corporate dynasties and their small family skirmishes were now huge gang wars one slight problem with the film was the difficulty to comprehend the dialogue since it was spoken in old english sub titles could have helped in the beginning of the movie but toward the end it became easier to understand this excellent movie poses another prob lem what genre is it romeo juliet contains so much drama yet enough comedy and action to be placed in either of those categories with the same award winning formula that was used by quentin tarantino in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction romeo juliet is sure fire modern masterpiece
bob the happy bastard quickie review the matrix what worse than y2k how about fully digital future where nothing is real that what computer programmer neo keanu reeves slowly learns as he enters the dangerous world that is the matrix movie directed by the wachowski brothers the guys behind the hip thriller bound before you groan at the presence of reeves in the lead role hold on there actually story with depth here it seems that group of hackers is out to stop the system that is the matrix led by the bald but brilliant laurence fishburne and assisted by carrie ann moss who looks quite cool in leather must say neo reeves is pretty much key player in this fight although he really doesn look it at first could this amateur be the one as fisburne thinks he is credit the wachowskis for putting together great story that allows suspense to build something that few special effects laden films seem to do these days there plenty of effects to go around of course but at least there backbone to build them on as well reeves is surprisingly good in his role as neo particularly in fight scene with fishburne that comes across as goofy yet great wish the villains weren quite so generic leftover men from looking for sweet sci fi actioner with plenty of stop motion swooping camera angles and of course motherlode of helicopter explosion now the wachowskis are headed into horror films with their next project bring it on
as revolutionary war hero in the patriot mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences you know the type his shirt is always shredded his face always scarred he has soft spot for his loved ones and to kill list for his enemies oscar hungry director executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century as gibson delivers lines like before this war is over am going to kill you schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind oddly enough the patriot is as much an epic three hour tear fest like gladiator as it is ninety minute guilty pleasure at times absorbing at others enjoyably insipid this is good bloody summer fun probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend some of the images are so zealously americanized the flag is used as lifesaving weapon for example that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it like emmerich id4 this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all sure it predictable and melodramatic but for moment after leaving the theater was dumbfounded with patriotism and isn that the point of the patriot gibson plays benjamin martin the lionized french and indian war veteran who at the beginning of the film is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with siyah servants not slaves as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields but when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by wicked redcoat colonel jason isaacs martin quickly decides to save the day or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich forming band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war martin becomes the number one target of the british army the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis tom wilkinson face was priceless entertainment and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time final battle is inevitable as for the numerous battle scenes they are expertly done clearer and more realistic than those of gladiator the gruesome images are what give this film an rating you really get sense of how warfare was performed during that time period everything is performed in an orderly but still quite gory fashion one side shoots then the other side then the remaining soldiers charge it organized strategic and according to martin ineffective there is very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martin take no prisoners method what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington played wonderfully by jason isaacs tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians who nervously avoid eye contact this character is viciously evil he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home even his eyes are evil his portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as cowardly and sadistic disagree with this accusation tavington does not represent his country his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general besides tavington the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized and stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies why give the audience reason to love the bad guys heck why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys the patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks with an action hero seeking revenge and comic book villain ready to take him down it lethal weapon for the colonial times god bless america and god bless the patriot
if there beast in men it meets its match in women too starring sarah patterson angela lansbury tusse silberg david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter from story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus in recent years there has been trend in the field of fantasy writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world investing it with new life and energy in modern times fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased they have become trite adventures involving leering witches friendly dwarves and cuddly talking animals but in their original forms fairy tales have dark wicked edge crows tear out the eyes of cinderella sisters gorier fate then they receive in the animated version hansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven writers have become fascinated by the bloodier morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots before this trend was in vogue angela carter whose stories always have dark wicked subversive edge had been reinventing fairy tales for years in the company of wolves she and neil jordan retell the story of kirmizi riding hood enlivening it with werewolves rolls royces and visit from satan the story is structured as dream occurring in the mind of rosaleen sarah patterson an adolescent girl about whose real life we learn very little within the dream there are number of inset stories most told by dream rosaleen grandmother angela lansbury and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing suggestive ways the result is surprisingly successful example of sinister contemporary fairy tale say surprisingly because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong and there are ways in which it does the performances are mediocre except for lansbury she finds the right note for the prim apple cheeked granny the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales the soundtrack synth heavy reminded me of bad 80s horror movies as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes probably state of the art at the time they are now laughable but jordan succeeds at what consider the trickiest aspect of the film he transcends the poor acting music effects and conveys sense of the fantastic of otherness one of the problems in adapting full blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader rather than being subjected to the realism of the screen part of me would love to see an adaptation of the lord of the rings but on the other hand know that any filmmaker recreation of ents hobbits and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what picture in my mind this makes jordan accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me he imbues the company of wolves with genuine sense of magic and mystery the somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes kind of ur reality the sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant the nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly the peasant village is rustic and cozy the woods old and hoary this archetypal realm is the setting for smart subtle literate script script which is as good as you expect from jordan himself an accomplished fiction writer and carter for carter the cauldron of story is witches brew bubbling over with primal ingredients mist shrouded forests ancient graveyards virginal girls and wise women wolves with glowing eyes she adeptly blends them all together there is symbolic richness to the film everything is permeated with sense of significance the point of it all think is to represent girl rites of passage on an unconscious primordial level night journey through the forest from the village to the grandmother home is the crux of the company of wolves don stray from the path rosaleen is told again and again and the path is both literal and figurative the path through the forest and the path of life staying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen elders carter and jordan never conventional explore what goes on when you leave the path those who stray will supposedly meet with dark fate this fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves but the werewolves connote many things death sex knowledge if straying from the path leads to death then it not good idea but if that what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge and therefore power then maybe it worth the risk when you leave the path the world becomes dangerous ambiguous place but it full of potential and it certainly more interesting than the disney version
didn realize how apt the name of this movie was until called the mpaa the motion picture association of america the folks who decide what nc 17 pg or to ask why the preview was rated so that we can make some sense of their response let me tell you about the movie itself the celluloid closet is documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades it brilliant funny naughty and extremely poignant it tore at my heart to watch gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that as rule gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen regardless of how veiled or how sordid the presence of gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they re not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be the movie itself is rated and for good reason it contains scenes of bloody violent gay bashing and graphic uninhibited sex as with any movie appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time so can decide for myself whether to see the movie with friend date my 11 year old niece alone or not at all but that the movie now back to the preview prior to this film being theatrically released it was originally filmed as documentary for hbo had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times there was no nudity no violence no bad language nothing that could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for general audience okay whoopi goldberg did refer to someone boning someone but the last knew that wasn one of the seven words you can say on tv except for scene of two fully clothed men kissing hmmmmm when inquired about the rating on the trailer very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from the handbook that trailer approved for all audiences could contain no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone hello was in the office and it was the middle of the day bravely pursued ve seen that trailer oh probably half dozen times gulped and don remember that scene well she chirped it there our little eyes are trained to see that no really in the words of dave barry am not making this up they are trained to see that when someone who was shocked at the rating the first time and made note to watch it carefully the following five times or so managed to let it slip past her gosh certainly don mean to question the mpaa or the handbook would however like to suggest that it they who are in the closet on this one and the light ain good in there but having seen the celluloid closet and being one of handful of straight people involved in primarily gay and lesbian weekly bible study email me and ll give you the details none of this was any big surprise the point of the movie was that homosexuality even in the politically correct 90s is ridiculously perceived as threat to mostly heterosexual society point well made in this candid and honest film now could go off on the mpaa ruling that trailer must contain no homosexuality or lesbianism and ask how that is defined particularly in light of some of the things both sexual and non sexual that ve watched straight people do in trailers just don feel the need to go there because it seems so obvious ll instead suggest that the mpaa re evaluated their evaluation criteria let the ratings reflect not subject content like sex and violence let them reflect attitude content in the future be interested in knowing whether the movie is rated for disrespectful or for stereotyped then truly be able to make an informed decision about how spent my time
full metal jacket very much like every other hard hitting film about the vietnam war is an shocking emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of young man private joker played by matthew modine during his tour in the vietnam war however full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before boot camp these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film even though found the later portions to be equally stunning as in platoon full metal jacket gets off to quick start the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits which is getting their heads shaved from there they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman played extremely well by the former drill instructor lee ermey apparently the solution was found for the perfect man to play drill instructor in the movies because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence vincent onofrio whom is dubbed gomer pyle by sgt hartman the film is continually narrated by private joker in which he explains his visions on what is going on the entire corps although repeatedly hammered by sgt hartman continues on private pyle however seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation and it basically does not stop that is until sgt hartman comes up with new plan he will punish the rest of the soon to be marines for pyle goof ups even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits and things take turn for the worst pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally physically and mentally cut out for the life of marine after graduation joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war which is his service he is not member of the infantry and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat when he sets out on documenting mission this question becomes very clear from the start joker joins up with platoon along with his hometown friend cowboy arliss howard and follows their everyday actions interviewing and filmming them along the way he also soon finds himself in position in which he must fight or die again as in the tradition of vietnam war films full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti war film or not few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of young man in vietnam as have others in the past this film in different ways also can be viewed as more powerful than others that again is up for debate and depends on your opinion one thing is for sure however no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to unfortunately many did
pulp fiction quentin tarantino anxiously awaited and superb follow up to reservoir dogs is absolutely and without doubt progressing as one of the most talked about loved and hated films of all time in all fairness it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it as if reservoir dogs wasn perfect tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction fast paced hard talking roller coaster ride of movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in seemingly perfect way every major character in this film is represented by terrific acting performance by the actor to begin with the two hit men vincent vega john travolta and jules winnfield samuel jackson these two characters work together perfectly and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect travolta in fact is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role if these two characters were not enough there the struggling boxer butch coolidge bruce willis the two small time criminals pumpkin tim roth and honey bunny amanda plummer the big man in charge marsellus wallace ving rhames and his attractive young wife mia uma thurman and the problem solver himself the wolf harvey keitel these are just the major characters smaller roles but equally terrific are handed to jimmie quentin tarantino young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business lance eric stoltz the far out drug dealer as well as maynard duane whitaker and zed peter greene two hillbillies who are the men behind no pun intended for those of you who have seen this very disturbing scene towards the end of the film the film interweaves three stories that at first seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other the film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold ups the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop unknowing of what lies ahead after this the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants the two men were sent to the apartment to recover mysterious briefcase for their boss marsellus wallace after basically toying with the men especially the unfortunate brett frank whaley vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase this is not before man jumps out from bathroom with 357 hand cannon shooting at the two gangsters he somehow completely misses them leading jules to cite divine intervention this is also the basis for more of the now famous tarantino dialogue the film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades butch was ordered to take fall in his latest fight but when he does not marsellus vows to find him wherever he is and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune vincent meanwhile has the honor of taking marsellus wife mia out on date while the big man is out of town vincent obviously is rather nervous about this especially after hearing the tale about man who was thrown out of window for supposedly giving mia foot massage after their date which seems to rather smoothly things take turn for the worst at the hands of vincent high priced heroin dubbed monster by lance each story continually progresses and new and amazing events occur eventually the stories all meet each other in the end with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant which happens to contain both vincent and jules pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade and possibly of all time along with its superb dialogue action writing directing and acting this film will not only latch onto you but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you and with most fans of this movie this is proved to be rather easy task although at times the graphic images violence and language may seem bit overpowering surely quentin tarantino fame was greatly escalated by this film and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon

well ll be damned what most excellent surprise not to be confused with the campy and far inferior 1988 remake starring ex porn star traci lords this more recent attempt at remaking the 1950 drive in schlockfest not of this earth is real gem and was quite possibly the best sci fi flick of 1995 once again movie king roger corman is behind this effort he directed the original but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer the rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns it seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries because it an absolute must see for sci fi fans and treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with kooky bent the plot in brief paul johnson michael york is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who though needing to kill people to live is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons his race is dying of mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying to find cure the key of which lies in the blood of humans he visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr rochelle whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf he also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda elizabeth barondes to move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires but before long amanda and johnson sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is lot more than just eccentric must admit my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging british actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat 1972 but his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding the weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech the dapper clothes and cool spectacles the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character york is by turns hilarious menacing and tragic this is tour de force and quite simply the best performance ve seen from him and while obviously made on modest budget the film boasts enormous strengths the casting is spot on the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent witty and consistently engaging cleverly updating the original the balance of horror and humour is just about perfect marked contrast to the earlier remake from 1988 the film doesn drag for second of its 90 minute running time thanks to tight editing and the sure hand of little known director terrance winkless and it doesn matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy this is schlock after all even if it is high class schlock in fact my only criticism of the film is that things get tad weak towards the end tighter direction could have given the climax more urgency and few of the characters act rather illogically given their life threatening situation but these are minor complaints just see it not of this earth is one of the biggest sci fi surprises in years and michael york in one cool swoop you ve made yourself movie legend dude
as devout atheist and an avowed believer in aliens have some idea of how ellie aroway jodie foster feels but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are different than hers can say that do exactly her reason is that she needs solid proof there is no proof that god existed so therefor she does not believe ellie also believes in aliens and has spent most of her life trying to prove they exist how can she say she doesn believe in god because of the lack of proof and then say she believes in aliens which are gereally less believed in than god without sounding like hypocrite that the catch 22 when aliens from the star vega fax her some plans for device to transport someone to them okay well they didn really fax them ellie wants to be the one to go but because of her atheism she is denied the position how dumb is that she discovers the transmitions then she isn allowed to go well because of bomb and psychopath jake busey she does end up going but not in the way that we would ve thought contact is based on novel by carl sagan who died during the filmmaking it is the best alien movie since close encounters of the 3rd kind and will end up being the best film of the year its views of science and religion will no doubt aggrivate some but will stimulate more glad at least one movie of the 90s can portray aliens in psitive light rather than bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides and then put on your body
one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids although black and white films are frequently viewed as suspect ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind and if you can find colorful action film even if it is from six decades ago then there is real possibility of take home hit so it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up copy of the adventures of robin hood high spirited version of the walter scott story nominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold melodramatic music ralph dawson fast paced editing and carl jules weyl lush sets the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley robin hood flynn with his handsome figure and toothy smile charms the audience while clearly having high old time himself let me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household the littlest rhodes jeffrey age liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more ll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review simply stated the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre the swashbuckler robin with smile from ear to ear fights off hundred men without scratch although the picture can be considered as little more than 1930 james bond the production values and the acting raise it above that level robin hood is classic story of rich and poor robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows in this movie however he seems much less interested in income redistribution than in fighting for his king and country robin with his courage and athletic skills serves as role model for kids and with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamy eyed lady marian fitzswalter the story has heavy romantic overtones filmed in the typical richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor the flesh tones are overly pink and there few color subtleties which match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players in scene after scene the picture charms the audience who wouldn fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest even if the outcome is so clearly preordained and of course he doesn just win he does so by splitting the other man arrow watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments sherlock holmes as the villain sir guy of gisbourne for example just doesn seem right even if basil rathbone did have real life identity outside of his most famous role and then there are those wigs from the makeup department so bad they look like rejects from mel brooks comedy as was popular in the cinema of that era people die with the most gentle prick of the sword and without any nasty bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks bad guys are banished rather than killed and lovers go off hand in hand doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing the result is wonderful fairy tale of movie with delightful cartoonish figures hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore so try to savor the old ones when you can the adventures of robin hood runs 42 it is not rated but containing absolutely nothing offensive it would get rating and is fine for all ages jeffrey thinks the film is great and gives it he recommends the movie particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures he hates the sight of blood in movies his favorite parts are the battles and the ending and his favorite characters are robin and king richard ian hunter
swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults steven spielberg may not have directed he only executive produced but his touch certainly is evident in this movie and he knows money making winner when he sees one the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of blockbuster big action funny comedy and the pacing of rollercoaster hopkins plays don diego de la vega otherwise known as zorro fighter for the people he is eventually captured by don rafael montero stuart wilson who also unintentionally kills his wife the film cuts to twenty years later where vega still wants to montero dead however he far too old now and trains up thief alejandro murrieta banderas to become the new zorro banderas motive to avenge the death of his brother who was killed at the hands of captain love matthew letscher who rather tastefully keeps the head in jar in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie with the scene set the movie goes on full blast with sword fights plenty and witty one liners banderas and hopkins have marvellous chemistry as the two zorro playing each other off with ease hopkins seems to come off little better but banderas does some excellent work as the bad guys wilson and letscher seem one dimensional but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way the audience does hate them which can be bad catherine zeta jones also pops up as hopkins daughter and although she provides little more than the usual female lead she delivers charming but one note performance the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones there delightful little scene where banderas and jones have sword fight and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed until jones clothes fall off all together the director fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye 1995 handles the film perfectly the action is well done and fast paced the comedy put across well the cast help lot but the direction is still outstanding although the film is very long the plot keeps chugging along and there barely dull moment however the film is little over indulgent and it could have been trimmed it manages to hold the attention thankfully and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel screenwriters john eskow ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script although they ve bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action the plot itself is barely existent there lots of little sub plots hanging around but there nothing substantial to bring them all together the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to buy california using altin stolen from the guy he buying the land off this sets up for temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the altin from little mines however this doesn seem to appear until nearly over hour into the film so the film is never quite sure where it going in the end however zorro provides action and comedy in spades it suitable for everyone so put the guilt behind and put some more money into spielbergs bank account you won regret it
catherine deane jennifer lopez is psychologist who has been hired to participate in project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up she has been experiencing moderate success with young boy in coma but the boy parents aren happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life as if trying to assure the boy parents wasn hard enough on her new development arises that furthers the strain on deane mental faculties vicious serial killer named carl stargher vincent onofrio has been kidnapping women locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in matter of days then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life sized dolls just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell stargher has traumatic experience that triggers schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia the police led by fbi agent peter novak vince vaughn are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim body but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state in last ditch attempt they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours initial reports about this film described it as cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix while it does share some characteristics with both films particularly the first forty minutes which seem almost like condensed version of lambs the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm the buzz around this project is that first time feature film director tarsem singh who won many awards for his video of losing my religion wanted script that he could fashion images out of instead of cohesive story and good portion of this film supports that theory despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and script that contains several logically questionable moments the cell does feature some remarkable imagery all of the sequences where we delve into someone mind are incredibly beautiful including the dank mind of stargher whose thoughts are reminiscent of an giger painting come to life mixed with tool music video proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe the first sequence that takes place in stargher mind is by far the best featuring one of the most ingenious traps ve ever seen in film involving horse which no one seeing this film will probably forget zoo like display of stargher victims which are animated like marionettes and stargher himself in giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world would have deemed the film brilliant but alas the sequences only become more silly as they go along despite painful nipple ring removal later in the film the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images but at least vincent onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance magnified by ten thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed in my opinion onofrio was one of the best creepy actors have ever seen in film but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful the newton boys feeling minnesota the thirteenth floor and the velocity of gary that have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though and will probably lead to bit of typecasting for him detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film as it contains heavy doses of both besides the nipple ring removal mention above there is also stargher penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs prior to his catatonia and capture which will have audiences recoiling sequence where catherine enters stargher mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting one moment also features character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit like device as narrative film the cell is sorely lacking as collection of images though the cell is extremely well done although the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half singh has done what he supposedly set out to do make film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together unfortunately well written script should have been considered too because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv provided of course that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos
when casting the key part of the voice of moses most people first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer the saint and the island of dr moreau but he was dreamworks choice in their first traditionally animated movie the prince of egypt the selection of kilmer proved to be wise one but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn in the casting department the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make biblical epic la cecil demille to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies now that is something fresh let me admit up front that was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off dreamworks antz seemed to be movie not quite appropriate for any age group the prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz but it is much more satisfying like antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixar bug life the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices danny glover is the voice of jethro jeff goldblum of aaron steve martin of hotep helen mirren of the queen michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti you can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god the movie which is weakest in the story department is cliff notes version of demille the ten commandments the script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in moses life demille took over three and half hours in order to do it justice at less than half of that the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesn establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters we meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket we watch him grow up and become best bud and chariot racing partner to ramses ralph fiennes the future pharaoh moses is free spirit and practical joker until he finds out his true identity as jew all ve ever known to be true is lie moses complains after finding out his real identity he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him after leaving egypt moses comes back to ask ramses to let moses people go this leads to the classic scene of the parting of the kirmizi sea which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally hand drawn animation of the most of the production it is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling drawn with rich palette of luxurious roses blues and golds the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last the construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust and other scenes are shot with the glow of rising sun the most original visual sequence in the film occurs during dream moses has done with an explicit two dimensional look the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story even though it has its weaknesses the prince of egypt is noble attempt to carve out new genre serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family this awe inspiring movie deserves to be seen the prince of egypt runs about 30 it is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family how old kid would need to be to be interested depends on the child but those over will probably like it
50 `aliens vs earth idea revamped if you have been following the movie news over the net you could not have escaped the hype over id4 it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july and up till now only after week of release it has nearly touched the us$100 million mark phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993 the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple earth defends itself against the aliens typical and highly popular 50 hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era the movie opens via star wars however unoriginal it may be it worked the aliens have sent large mother ship supposedly to be size of the moon to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth the us president pullman does not know of the aliens intention but soon finds out when david goldblum scientist discovers that the aliens are counting down to synchronised attack on all the major cities capt hiller smith hot shot 18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc his squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders he crash lands after spectacular on chase over the grand canyon one of the many highlights of the movie id4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses acting on the whole was ok although thought that bill pullman was bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle do we smell bit of braveheart here no prizes for guessing how id4 ends its just plain obvious id4 borrows heavily from star wars return of the jedi alien and in some parts of the movie could even sense bit of files on screen if were to critically review this movie id4 is full of plot holes corny dialogue and ridiculously dumb aliens however below that wafer thin plot and on screen flaws id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion an idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie thus maintaining screen viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable no matter how ridiculous id4 was produced under modest budget of us$68 million film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich universal soldier stargate and producer dean devlin assembled team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company some of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable especially the epic standoff between 150 18 and 250 alien saucers reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi id4 is movie for all though there are many explosions and implied deaths there are no gory scenes of human destruction thus young kids should be able to take it sit back and don be too critical chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as was if you are not planning to watch any movies this year please at least make time for this one this film is best watched on the big screen

there some movies enjoy even though know probably shouldn and have difficult time trying to explain why did lucky numbers is perfect example of this because it such blatant rip off of fargo and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me know in the minority here but let me explain the film takes place in harrisburg pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter john travolta plays the local big shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards russ is married to crystal lisa kudrow blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema she selfish nasty bitch full of lust and desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market crystal cheating on russ with their collective boss dick ed neil the tv station manager she doesn seem to genuinely like either of them but it all she can do in this one horse town much like fargo this movie tells the story of man who going broke and has to pull off huge scam to get rich quick he enlists the help of his english friend gig tim roth the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery along the way subplot involving two bit thug named accurately dale the thug michael rappaport gets mixed up in the process there also bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you re not expecting this is farce which is basically straightforward adult oriented comedy but doesn go as far as classic siyah comedy should where as fargo was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny lucky numbers is just funny because you can take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously it all big cartoon basically but it funny and can respect that travolta is great in his role and even though he not really likable character he trying to be nice guy despite the fact he creep he like gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill crystal is just the opposite she constantly arguing and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself kudrow is perfect in this role since she spent years on tv as the dim witted phoebe on friends here is character is basically very evil incarnation of phoebe have to admit was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money like jackie brown an elmore leonard adaption the story is about circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has been won illegally the screenplay does fine job in balancing the characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus more and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do the ending itself is great it surprising and funny and makes you feel good you realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies worth of stories into two hours time and didn fall apart although many other critics might beg to differ liked it and could see it again isn that what makes movie good
as much as wanted to like this film as went into it the more pleased was when left first getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz if you liked scream you ll love wild things campbell gives stunning performance this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days oh yeah the day newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me now onto more serious stuff and with this film mean that in nearly sarcastic way wild things has single handedly broken down the rules surrounding the rating from the mpaa not saying that in bad way but when you see this film you may be shocked by what you see however perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film charming cast and tricky plot that they let the film slide with an rating being mormon bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film trouble is have already seen it and like it wild things is film noir of the 90s filled with 40s sensibilities and yet breaking the rules and modern day taboos of 90s culture the style in which it is filmed is rich in color the actors are all gorgeous people seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film sure it all too good to be true but ain it fun to watch when movies like this come along sort of better version of basic instinct there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it there will be people who don want to admit liking what they see but tell you most anyone who sees this will like it wild things begins at mavi bay high school the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into it almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance totally based on looks alone of course there are those select few who may look slightly ugly but compared to the average person they are gorgeous immediately the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time we can turn off our brains right wrong while you may be expecting one thing to happen it certainly doesn turn out that way the film begins in classroom with nearly all the main characters present there sam lombardo matt dillon counselor for the students he heading the class discussion there also kelly van ryan denise richards snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam teaching the class however are two policemen ray duquette kevin bacon and gloria perez daphne rubin vega who want to talk about sex cheers crimes boos what is sex crime ray asks not gettin any one student responds this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch however upon hearing this one student suzie toller neve campbell stands up and leaves the room commenting that they can both kiss part of her body and so wild things sets into motion quickly kelly begins hitting on sam but sam doesn want anything to do with her advances kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep surprisingly that really all can tell you about the plot any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists and what more these plot twists are actually unpredictable going along the way of scream wild things maintains that film surprises and then adds even more to them there are more plot twists in this film than probably any have ever seen and even though you think you may get tired of them the surprises are so genuine that it rather pleasing going back over them in my mind nearly all of them work though some stretch the boundaries of belief thankfully the convoluted plot doesn give us much time to think about each one pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy well it is this is pretty much just one trashy film however it is the kind of trashy that isn hard to watch it good trash in sense one the screenplay knows that it not to be taken seriously and it includes lot of humor and satire into the story this varies everywhere from kelly mother theresa russell who is more of caricature of rich people all the way to an ambulance chasing lawyer bill murray who wears neck brace to cover an insurance scam he is running bill murray also provides the best character in the film and most of the genuine laughs and two the sex is more than gratuitous although not unwelcomed wild things is supposed to have sex in it what film with that title wouldn and this movie breaks the boundaries instead of having heterosexual sex scenes it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell don worry it not as graphic as you might think the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon full frontal nude scene it very brief so if you blink you may miss ahem it and for as long as can remember don think have seen an rated film show an erect one before it not completely but judging from the audiences reaction it was more than they expected too also during one scene late in the film there seemed to be relationship brewing between bacon and dillon characters but nothing came of it makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the rating or if the actors refused to do it what first made me want to see wild things was its cast neve campbell of course has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released here however she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays gothic pothead the closest role to this was her performance in the craft though even in that she was nice girl campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent you can tell she will be around for long time denise richards will also be around for long time although she may be limited to the roles without much range here she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff yet effective performance in starship troopers hopefully one day she will land very good role that can display her ability and then there is daphne rubin vega newcomer to the movies she gives very good performance although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and half towards the end she does get bigger part on the male side matt dillon is probably the best giving subtle performance that surprises with every twist kevin bacon has slightly wooden character but he makes the most of it you must have admiration though for what he did on screen and judging from many of the women reactions in the theater to that shot they have grown deeper appreciation for bacon yeah right and then there is bill murray his performance is the comic relief and he nearly steals the film as whole the entire cast works wondrously together and they seem at home even when doing the menage troi director john mcnaughton who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry portrait of serial killer has constructed wonderfully twisty plot that works his direction is smooth and stylish the visuals are striking filled with rich colors and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air however he seems more at home when the actors aren talking his fly by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant and his photography of denise richards climbing out of the pool is highlight the cinematography is gorgeous in its details its not often that you see film like this and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures then there is the music this was probably the most obvious thing to me as it set the perfect mood for the film it hard to describe in words so just see the film and listen to it it wonderfully composed and presented and be sure to stick around during the closing credits mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use while most comedies use it for outtakes he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot but it an entertaining way to finish the film plus there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun wild things is appropriately rated for strong sexuality nudity language and violence again the nudity is rather unnecessary but let face it people want to see it so why not give it to them neve campbell admirably has no nudity clause in her contract and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off way to go neve the sex scenes are graphic especially the first one we see between the mother and one of her deck hands one almost wonders how they got away with the rating the language is quite harsh too ranging from sexual innuendo to your average everyday profanity and can stress it enough don allow kids under 18 to see this film the target age for the movie is the 18 24 range and that who should see it it definitely not for those under 18 did mention that this film is rated however for those that do get chance to watch it you will probably more likely be pleased and may even take friends to see it the next time
guess it credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour could not be ruined even by the nauseating comedy of chris tucker fan of jackie chan in just about any medium and this movie lets him not only do his impressive as ever martial arts schtick but show off his comic timing as well it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects this time around the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan john lone who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states still not sure how you can make fortune doing that is there place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones the only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns of course it up to hong kong detective lee chan and trash talking lapd detective james carter tucker to take the bad guys out and the authorities to the extent that they even exist stay out of their way rush hour turns the tables on the first film in that here it carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out guarantee that my rating would have been at least half of grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan he refuses to shut up not only did his voice feel like jackhammer on my head but his jokes just aren funny pathetic mixture of sub par eddie murphy fasttalking blather and wannabe chris rock white man black man jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny realize that in movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates but didn anyone realize how irritating tucker incessant ranting and raving was if this is all the comedian has to offer then don care to see any more of his films fortunately chan makes for marvelous straight man and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely it not often that one actor can so completely save movie but there is no other name for what he does whenever he on screen rush hour comes to nearly breathtaking often hilarious life much of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be player but who cares can think of few high concepts that are funnier the movie ends with outtakes that as usual show that chan isn perfect and that it does indeed take him few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to look seamless chris tucker botches some lines as well and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie lot of people have pointed out rush hour isn very different from its predecessor in tone or style but liked the original and like the sequel though certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it director brett ratner the family man keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes guess sometimes the shotgun approach works it not great jackie chan but it jackie chan and that enough up next jay and silent bob strike back
as write the review for the new hanks ryan romantic comedy you ve got mail am acutely aware that am typing it on computer and sending it billion miles away on the internet am also aware that have just spent the last hours watching the world biggest paid commercial for america online and wonder is that so bad well the commercial part is as for the movie well as long as can watch tom hanks and meg ryan think ll be okay to paraphrase james berardinelli whose reviews admire very much tom hanks and meg ryan can act they are both wonderful but for all of hanks glorious work in serious films such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan and his glorious triumph in philadelphia like him best when he suitably obnoxious tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in romantic comedy when he going to get the girl the only question is how meg ryan america high school sweetheart can act she had handful of memorable performances including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally must not mention what she does due to the well um you get the idea and if you don get the movie fantastic but like her best when she well perky she is so adorably perky cute that together with hanks they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples but don really know all know is that just like them both they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that really hard to resist and not going to even try they re just really really cute sweet and charming hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle here the setup is little different kathleen kelly ryan owns small children bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her she is successful beautiful and dates well known columnist with very radical idea kinnear she is also having an affair of sorts you see kathleen with the handle shopgirl is secretly emailing ny152 they have strictly un detailed relationship there are no specifics and they have no idea who each other is ny152 happens to be joe fox hanks multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega bookstores run by his father coleman fox books has decided to open store on the west side right across from little children bookseller named shop around the corner run by perky girl named kathleen kelly every morning these two email each other silly and every day they fight to the death it charming premise and one that works nicely balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have it also has the great sense of being classic romance there is no let have sex tonight mantra if you ll excuse my bluntness this is solid romance built around that vague concept of love hmm well the movie goes through twists and turns having some sad moments and happy ones until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan hook up to use modern terminology and kiss their way into happiness you know it going to happen the question is now thankfully ephron has wonderful supporting cast with posey kinnear chappelle and host of others including great scene involving brothers aunts and two sweet kids it all cute and wonderful and for all of the idealism it makes me feel good hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is he is believe america greatest actor does he show it here nah but he still tom hanks and she still meg ryan which is what this movie boils down to it pure confection all the bits about the godfather the jokes the superb script it all really sweet there are some immense flaws like pacing the last third of the movie really doesn work as well as would have liked and for romantic comedy it slow once hanks knows the secret it gets really slow even looked at my watch couple times to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss was waiting for so that could get home at reasonable hour the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated mail when my kids are my age don know what we ll be using but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody and meg ryan just loves to dive into pillow better than anyone in movie history they just work together and it nice to see it gives you well smile the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was ve always believed that movies are very powerful very powerful indeed you see mankind has three abilities he needs to survive the ability to think entertain and procreate movies can definitely do the first two and as for the third well rather not think about that always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint and that films that entertained you were good because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for night and was thinking about how incredible year tom hanks has had hanks was the driving force behind one of the year best films in saving private ryan which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world he also half of the glue behind the year best example of pure entertainment tom hanks and meg ryan are magical as is this movie it sweet lovely affair with technology twist it may be long commercial but it gave me pretty big smile on my face
take number fill out form and wait your turn starring kati outinen kari nen sakari kuosmanen elina salo written directed by aki kaurism ki cinematography by timo salminen it might be possible to call drifting clouds satire or siyah comedy but that would imply sense of anger of vitriol of energy drifting clouds is what you get when the rage and vitality are gone it is the sad slow story of lauri and ilona married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward he loses his job as tram driver because everyone drives cars nowadays within couple of months she loses her position as head waiter when her restaurant is bought out by chain and the entire staff replaced conversation early in the film reveals lot about their situation lauri has surprised ilona by buying her tv which she greets with little enthusiasm she notes that they haven finished paying for the bookshelves or the couch yet he says that in four years the payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the shelves it would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn spoken with such resigned weariness this sets the tone for the rest of the movie there is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery but at the centre there is frustration and futility and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity there is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal the movie is about two people and what happens to them and nothing else matters lauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship respect culture passion they go to the movies and walk out past old posters for atalante and argent but the movie they have just seen is pointless violent unfunny comedy their house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant painted and upholstered in lifeless colours ugly greens dull reds insipid blues full of inelegantly functional objects and appliances the art design is impeccable in its tawdriness and director aki kaurism ki often matches the colour of characters clothes with the background colour and or lighting so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment there is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love their downward downsized downtrodden lives have momentum that is almost comic as one setback succeeds another bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of roulette wheel it must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs more farce more deadpan wit but the film great strength is the sober empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilona misfortunes irony would be an injustice situations and settings are broad and exaggerated this is not realism but they are not distorted the emotions are authentic if it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens despite the droll performances the laconic humour that because kaurism ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered he shows us how humiliating it must be for woman of thirty eight who has worked long and hard to win respectable position to be forced to accept job as dishwasher in two bit restaurant how humiliating it must be for man nearing 50 to confront his wife former employer demanding the rest of her wages only to have the crap beaten out of him unable to land single punch when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the money all this is observed keenly with great economy every cut every line of dialogue is judicious if most films are novelistic in their telling this one brings the focus and concentration of short story to bear but what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the 96 minute running length have seen many movies far less profound less humane less necessary than drifting clouds but they filled me with an urge to watch them again and this one did not it does not need to be seen twice its every detail and implication can be absorbed in one viewing it is not movie that will be seen by large audience because it cannot be pitched to one there is no selling point it is all understatement restraint melancholy the characters are unremarkable their best years behind them their dreams dissipated it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay the bills this does not make them less fascinating merely less marketable which is shame because this is movie which should be seen precisely because it pays attention to people and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore it engages us and touches us and resolves surprisingly and movingly into something resembling happy ending the only thing greater than the ill luck that governs the characters lives is their refusal to give in to despair their persistence is rewarded with what might be called feel good ending elsewhere but not here because this ending differs in kind from most such endings this one has truly been earned
it curious thing ve found that when willis is not called on to carry the whole movie he much better and so is the movie even though in the sixth sense he is the name he doesn have the pivotal role that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear cute pun seer year old boy who can see ghosts if osment was cute or precious the director going for the maudlin this would be nothing more than movie of the week thankfully osment is not only better than that but in some instances blows everyone else off the screen in bravura performance we get to see his fears vulnerabilities strengths and intelligence which makes the sixth sense one of the best movies ve seen this year the whole cast matches him in quality with willis giving fairly low key performance that matches the subject matter one thing about this movie its target this isn sfxfest like the haunting or gorefest this is more what call supernatural drama more interested in characters than in dazzling you with makeup one caveat there lovely twist in the movie something like the usual suspects where you end up replaying the movie in your head rethinking what you have just seen was extremely lucky to see it as sneak preview in toronto before any hype or critical reviews were out so went in with no biases if anyone want to talk to about the movie before you see it don let them let the director explain on his own pace and you ll enjoy the movie vastly more
to me nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in martin scorsese film despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed the actor remains gifted and versatile screen presence ever since the big success of the action thriller `face off in 1997 the hollywood road has been rocky one for mr cage the perpetually awful assassination thriller `snake eyes was one of 1998 worst films `8mm was disappointing lost cause but who better than scorsese to match cage wit and intensity which he does in miraculous fashion with `bringing out the dead cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day to day after five years of the stress inducing job frank basically just staggers onward relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends he also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care namely young girl named rose who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york frank desperately wants to be fired but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need `i ll fire you tomorrow he promises frank is accompanied by fresh face every night in the ambulance the first is larry john goodman who always has food on the brain the second is marcus ving rhames deeply religious siyah man who incorporates the power of jesus into regular rescue operation and finally tom tom sizemore is deranged sociopath hungry for blood found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for single shift with frank but they never figured into the actual plot each is merely colorful presence to help develop frank character because `bringing out the dead is predominantly study of his mind and detailed personality the one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary patricia arquette the daughter of newly admitted patient who suffered from severe heart attack arquette who recently received the wounds of christ in `stigmata performs well around real life husband cage it unfortunate that after such intriguing character trials and tribulations the relationship between frank and mary slips during mishandled ineffective finale the movie belongs to the one two punch of cage and scorsese who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to `bringing out the dead although it certainly lacks the grit and hard edge of something like `goodfellas scorsese manages to hit nerve with his latest picture the incredible camera work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration fans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive darkly humorous roots after somewhat of departure with 1997 `kundun does `bringing out the dead rival scorsese finest work only occasionally some of the film feels surprisingly limp but there is enough energy in it interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice those expecting grisly risqu product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight arrow approach but it still solid admirable effort `bringing out the dead was written by the acclaimed paul schrader who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as `taxi driver and `raging bull schrader script is full of moments wonderful sharply defined moments that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay the exceptional aspects of the film are it astounding technical credits and the amazing cast goodman and sizemore are both electric well mainly sizemore but it the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves second look watch the actor deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects gothic band member and you ll understand why he won golden globe `bringing out the dead is raw and electrifying often enough to mask it certain flaws scorsese and cage for that matter have done better but their intentions are certainly admirable
metro ve seen san francisco in movies many times there was 1994 interview with the vampire and most recently the rock now yet again san francisco is the setting for this movie eddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper of the sfpd he is their top hostage negotiator and the very best at what he does when his best friend on the force is killed by joe michael wincott in terrific performance psychotic demented jewel thief roger makes it his mission to capture the guy before he strikes again meanwhile roper tries to rekindle relationship with his british ex girlfriend veronica while helping to rear new up and comer from swat who an expert sniper and marksman michael rappaport despite the obligatory cop movie scenes does every cop new partner movie have to start the same way where the sgt assigns roper partner roper confronts the sarge etc this film is still one heck of an explosive ride scene involving cable car has to be seen to be believed and boasts some amazing car stunts eddie murphy shines in this tailor made role and for once his character shows depth and concern when confronting joe in prison you can feel the anger drip from every word michael rappaport is basically throwaway he serves no purpose except to be buddy to murphy and get disabled in the final reel so that eddie can save the day typical action escapist fare michael wincott offers the best performance as the crazed killer and jewel thief joe never before have seen such villian written like this where could actually believe that he was serious and take him seriously maybe just thought that this role was different due to wincott perfectly raspy voice don know what do know though is that although metro is basically typical action retread it manages to cover new ground and shed new light on tired old cliches the film is triumph and an entertaining one at that it doesn meander or trail off from its main character an enjoyable two hours metro is enjoyable witty action packed and fun and makes for great action movie that perfect for all of us that need an escape from reality
the deep end uses color palette of rich earth tones surrounded by vast array of blues alluring attractive blues but also icy and foreboding after taking in their beauty the eye seeks out the reassuring browns and greens like tired swimmer searching for the safety of land the production works that way as well it pulls you in initially as crisp thoroughly modern thriller with clipped exchanges between defiantly non communicative characters but the real draw of the film is the submerged humanity of two key players as the deep end gradually reveals the melodramatic core beneath its ironic candy coating spoiler alert the following reveals the basic storyline believe the plot points are incidental because the real rewards come in exploring the mindset of the main characters but still you should proceed at your own risk with her husband tom naval officer often away at sea margaret hall tilda swinton holds down the fort taking care of the children beau jonathan tucker paige tamara hope and dylan jordon dorrance while her father in law jack peter donat hovers in the background always watching the story opens with margaret leaving the family home in lake tahoe to storm male strip club in reno it seems that beau her eldest is having an affair with darby reese josh lucas disreputable sort 12 years his senior margaret demands that darby leave her son alone only to have the man smirk at her and announce he ll be glad to steer clear of beau for $5000 back at home she tries to talk about it all with her son but the kid won even confirm that he gay let alone discuss the issues she has with his boyfriend he does however get attentive when she reveals darby $5 000 offer even as he maintains his sullen demeanor late in the evening darby shows up outside tossing pebbles at beau window like schoolchild the two meet by the water at the boathouse where something important happens won reveal what suffice to say we become aware of significant fact that margaret does not all of this happens in the first few minutes of the movie by the way within day or so margaret life becomes even more complicated when suave man named alec goran visnjic turns up with an explicit videotape documenting the sex life of beau and darby he and his associate are willing to destroy the tape once margaret coughs up $50 000 oh what mother to do end spoilers written directed and produced by scott mcgehee and david siegel suture the deep end is based on elisabeth sanxay holding 1940 novel the blank wall which was also the source of the 1949 film the reckless moment ve neither read the book nor seen the movie but understand that the filmmakers changed some details in holding story the scandalous relationship is between an older man and margaret teen age daughter switching the gender makes the tale seem more contemporary and it also raises questions about margaret motives many reviews of the deep end describe margaret as mother ferociously protecting her son but wonder consider this margaret lives in meticulously kept upscale home her husband is absent most of the time and seems to be regarded as larger than life figure her father in law is constantly present almost as if he is monitoring for his son and when her husband does call margaret is careful not to tell him about anything disturbing that is going on with the family so is margaret mother who accepts her son sexual orientation and is simply trying to shield the young man from lover she fears will take advantage of him or is she caretaker of museum of upper middle class complacency desperate to maintain the status quo so that everything will be postcard perfect when the old man returns from the sea you sort it out regardless the resonance of the deep end comes from two actors goran visnjic best known from the tv drama er is striking as blackmailer unlike any you ve seen before he engages margaret in mesmerizing dance of protocol chivalry and simmering eroticism but the star of this show without doubt is the remarkable tilda swinton watch the shadings depth resource vitality and understated sexuality she gives margaret and try to imagine the film without her days after my second viewing of the deep end can still vividly picture her negotiating with villains trying to connect with her son and diving into icy mavi water the deep end is an exceptional film and tilda swinton is the best part of it
for movie about disco era excess 54 comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club think of it as sort of boogie nights lite where that similarly structured and set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings on and skidded on destructive midpoint tone shift 54 leaves the kinkier details to your imagination it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter but it thankfully never resorts to preaching either in fact were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment 54 would be about as feathery as the time period popular female hairstyle studio 54 was haven for the rich famous and generally good looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986 inside anything went and we are told everything did the film fictional main character is shane shea ryan phillippe the jerky jock from know what you did last summer fresh faced 19 year old who dreams of venturing beyond the club velvet rope and coming face to face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines his wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell mike myers spots him amongst crowd of gawkers one night in 79 and permits him passage but not before he doffs his hideous shirt of course once inside shane becomes seduced by the club dizzying vortex of sex and drugs he has such good time that he doesn want to leave so he seeks employment as busboy he quickly becomes friends with greg breckin meyer and anita salma hayek married couple who work along side of him greg fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as studio 54 bartender while anita checks coats but desires recording contract to call her own after rubbing elbows among other things with renowned socialite sela ward and gaining the personal interest of rubell shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of 54 but fame doesn come without price 54 major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players at slim hour and half the film is too short to take on such multi character focus and more than few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act alleged last minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction since 54 sometimes feels like it missing scene here or there nowhere is this more apparent than in shane relationship with soap opera actress julie siyah neve campbell frequent studio 54 patron whom he long admired from afar the romance is prodded along before it has chance to transform into something special that 54 works despite these limitations then is largely due to the competence and energy with which it assembled sure it shallow slick sanitized portrait of bygone age and sure we ve seen the rags to riches story gazillions of times but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision the film boasts some fine comic creativity the pinnacle of which is disco dottie the wedding singer ellen dow an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public but slides up to shane behind 54 closed doors and asks for funky little treat the solid sexy cast smooths out if only while you re caught up in the film any rough spots belonging to their alter egos or the plot newcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat he and campbell as fetching as ever look so good together it shame their subplot goes nowhere meyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him delight to watch in clueless he was the stoner with the joker smile while hayek simply sizzles especially when leading dance class with the mantra one two three attitude sherry stringfield unidentifiable under big 70s hair takes on her first big screen gig since she left er as rubell accountant but she criminally underused as the droopy eyed drug addled steve rubell myers is worth the price of admission alone when he not playing the life of the party the ex saturday night live comedian strips away all of rubell confidence and swagger to show man desperately trying to fill his empty unhappy life with exorbitance it moment worthy of pity when while lounging on bed of money and vomiting from particularly heavy evening he attempts to seduce one of his employees and while his performance is largely serious myers mixes the empathy with delicate austin powers esque wink thus keeping consistent with 54 overall feel gaudy larger than life and satisfyingly ornamental not unlike giant disco ball
brian depalma needs hit really badly since scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 depalma has seen casualties of war raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames consequently it would be easy enough to consider carlito way shrewd commercial choice for depalma reteaming with al pacino scarface and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes it doesn hurt any that he has latched on to solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn carlito way while hampered by depalma characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism is truly tense and engrossing drama carlito brigante pacino is life long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given second chance in 1975 carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on technicality he declares himself reformed tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into rental car business in the bahamas among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld penn carlito crooked attorney and childhood friend and bodyguard pachanga luis guzman carlito rediscovers old flame gail penelope ann miller and seems ready to retire in peace old ways die hard though and old associates pull carlito step by step back into life he can seem to shake carlito way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film in the first carlito accompanies his young cousin on drug buy which will have anyone with pulse on the edge of their seat the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station both highlight depalma gift for choreographed mayhem and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely yet for all the viscera found the character study even more compelling carlito brigante has lot of michael corleone in him an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera there more of an immediacy to carlito way an ever present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion you sense that there no way after so many years that carlito can stay out of trouble indeed he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more function of time than change of heart you don get reformed you just run out of wind pacino captures carlito dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy sean penn is even better turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys kleinfeld is an outsider with huge chip on his shoulder he could have been simply pathetic heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct he shows man moving steadily towards the brink making the moment he goes over quite jolting as compelling as the narrative is viewers may experience profound sense of deja vu depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with point of view tracking shot and copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms like 360 degree swing around kiss vertigo via body double and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables from story standpoint there an obligatory love story with cliche long suffering girlfriend character penelope ann miller is good but limited actor who doesn do anything new with the role and eventually she becomes just distraction never integrated fully enough into the story still it easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid the two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn break carlito way plays like tragic novel deliberate confident and powerful those willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well rewarded
us critic type people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies aren thrill rides but think that back to the future ii is one of the few exceptions if the original film had the spirit of the 1950s then this has the spirit of the 80s full of fights chase scenes cliff hangers special effects some detective work and of course the vision of the high tech future the film picks up exactly where the first film left off with doc lloyd marty fox and jennifer elizabeth shue travelling 30 years into the future because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifer kids doc tells marty he must take his son place at an incident that will cause chain reaction if marty mcfly jr says yes to griff wilson in one of four different roles whoever said history tends to repeat itself wasn joking especially when it comes to the movies essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015 but it not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously parody of itself at the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better and it seems like everything copasetic right wrong since when do things go according to plan in the back to the future movies there are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story won even bother to list them all basically we get to see marty as an old man his house his family etc we also go back to an alternate 1985 and then back again to 1955 with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch breath the films best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows lot of the action that occurred from another angle it difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail the only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense instead of grand finale we get lots of little victories by the end everything is back to normal but something happens that leads to yet another sequel but it doesn seem gratuitous back to the future part ii is really great adventure movie it certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor
magnolia left me relling from the theatre staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft at nearly three and half hours magnolia will strike some as brute of film it not only demands your attention but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions it is delirious depressing heady pretentious surreal filmmaking it also movie that will polarize its viewers director paul thomas anderson takes talented cast wraps them in net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in symphony of despair whose song doesn let up until an oddly exhilerating biblically influenced pseudo climax the character make up modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives there is frank mackey tom cruise slithery snake charmer of men whose search and destroy seminars teach how to mentally rape woman to get into her pants there is earl partridge jason robards dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son there is game show host jimmy gator phillip baker hall self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than few secrets from his public and there is police officer jim kurring john reilly who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system perhaps masking man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process given equal weight are stories involving coke addled emotional cripple melora walters former tv quiz show champion william macy materialistic adulterous wife julianne moore child jeremy blackman victimized by mentally abusive parent and caring empathetic nurse philip seymour hoffman hovering over all these characters is cloud of death lies and despair it is not pleasant movie there is not one bad note in the acting it is affecting and layered and wonderful there is moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films then he tops himself with mesmerizing deathbed scene walters plays her character with red eyed rawness and fierce self destructiveness that is anxiety inducing robards convincingly portrays fading whisper of man who still hears lion roar when he speaks director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote the problem is that he stays on them too long julianne moore character linda quickly escalates to frenzied pitch of guilt tears screaming and remorse and never backs off from it after few hours it turns from interesting to chinese water torture quite few scenes such as the game show go on just bit too long and will be off putting for those used to pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around and just what is the theme alienation hopelessness anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesn make it easy the film starts by showing three strange and seemingly unrelated events it harbinger of the synchronicity to come at times different stories reach reach key moments at the same time other times stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory regardless of what else is happening anderson is audacious enough to even have group sing in the middle of the film what surprising is that it mostly works if you have doubts about anderson intentions ll ask you to pay attention to the final frame despite all the sturm und drang magnolia ultimately speaks to man capacity for hope and attempts at redemption despite magnolia needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur showing off fro the masses have to admire his guts this is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling my rating bulleye stars side note helping anchor the film is perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann her lyrics often add depth to scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful when she sings save me at the end it enhances the yearning felt by the characters just as wise up mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives
director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days terry gilliam comes to mind as another one film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell story but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of story so whenever director uses the camera to its fullest potential the film almost automatically deserves good review and when they add fascinating story to it you have nearly perfect entertainment fincher the game is no exception to this the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in long time fincher hasn made film since seven his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever so it is about time he made another film and what ride it is the game isn quite as powerful as seven but in some ways it is better overall the game could have used little more clarity or little more uncertainty it walks line of insanity and reality but it never goes either way until the very end the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events and it makes lot of sense once everything is set straight unfortunately unlike the usual suspects we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening whether it be true or false however this also gives the film frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent the game is told completely from its main character point of view nicholas van orton michael douglas is high strung and isolated businessman he lives alone in his giant mansion divorced from his wife elizabeth and is celebrating his 48th birthday the same age at which his father committed suicide at in the same mansion for his 48th birthday conrad sean penn the rebel of the family gives nicholas gift certificate to crs consumer recreation services it will make your life fun again his brother promises as skeptical as nicholas is he is somewhat intrigued and annoyed by the lack of information something this businessman hates seeing billboard in an office he decides to visit the mysterious company jim feingold james rebhorn greets nicholas and guides him through the sign up process which consists of psych tests physicals emotional responses and other mind games each game is suited to each person emotional and psychological needs explains feingold one day nicholas gets call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company what he doesn realize is that the game has already begun the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas way how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive the detail involved in fincher shots is incredible and almost requires second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them with seven fincher had almost every single shot mean something he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to compared to seven though the game is light and comical because of this film sense of humor and self awareness nothing can be taken quite seriously so don try to make much sense of what goes on in the game because it doesn want you to what does make sense is the final revelation when everything becomes apparent and clear if taken as it is the game ending makes complete sense but if you try and critique every minute detail then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility perhaps that is the reason docked the film while trying to remain realistic and plausible the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen we don really care if douglas character lives or not because it isn believable the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller michael douglas gives terrific performance as nicholas douglas has played lonely businessmen before but here he adds another level to his performance his character who is normally level headed and relies on facts is forced to trust nobody can he believe the waitress he bumped into what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well and gives one of his best performances even better than his falling down persona the supporting cast is essential in this film and casting was critical sean penn is always good and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas brother deborah kara unger from crash is the waitress he bumps into and her performance is extremely good in fact she almost steals the film from douglas james rebhorn portrays his character very well and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas predicament another good performance comes from armin mueller stahl from shine as the book editor but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game he not only commands this cast but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life the game is rated for language violence some gore and some nudity and drugs what is essential for this film to work is the writing john brancato and michael ferris have woven confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue and some very funny moments this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects did however the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year best films
have soft spot in my heart for pure amoral sleaze liked showgirls there said it typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz sex filled cinematic tabloid ish trash wild things is the best sleazy film ve ever seen it filled with great performances graphic sex three way sex rape charges double crosses plot twists genitalia of all genders graphic violence death witty humor and best of all denise richards criticizing this film for being disgusting raucous and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing or titanic for being lofty and epic wild things is film that succeeds in its endeavors but don just admire it for this admire it for being so entertaining and such fun time at the movies must admit up front however that am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal imagine that this shows it hard to give plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn be known thought had the whole thing worked out from the trailer but was wrong there are lot of turns here ll just say that the film takes place in mavi bay rich little town in florida in mavi bay lives sam lombardo matt dillon teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students kelly van ryan denise richards and suzie toller neve campbell kelly mother sandra theresa russell immediately presses charges all of this happens fairly early in the film and right up until this point had the whole film predicted was wrong though and every time was proven wrong was shocked wild things isn even remotely plausible but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless and often invited just for kicks remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers give the preview four stars it made me want to see the movie so much that ve been waiting for it anxiously ever since over the past few weeks though started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview see independence day thankfully was proven wrong the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company not only does it make us want to see the film but it doesn give away any of the secrets but not here to talk about the preview here to talk about denise richards now found her mildly interesting in starship troopers but in wild things she appeals to such base instinct that every scene she in demands attention in way that almost no other performer can of course this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes and flawless body but thought she did great job acting too stop laughing no richards is truly find she is talented and always convincing in this film this mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her vital asset to any film she may grace in the future the other actors are good too dillon is as suave as ever it nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in out bacon does good job acting all determined and stuff as sex crimes officer neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them though won pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex for plot like this to work all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived that okay because director john mcnaughton knows that he making self consciously wicked film each scene even the three way sex scene is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton and the result is sleaze fest that too smart to resist there isn an inconsistent moment in wild things every bit of it is alluring garbage so trashy it funny and so entertaining it painful loved it

the 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films one was _gattaca_ the other was _the thirteenth floor_ just as _gattaca_ was overshadowed by the mighty _titanic_ _the thirteenth floor_ was relegated to obscurity by _the matrix_ however _the thirteeth floor_ though it deals with similar themes is much better movie than the frenetic childish and improbable _matrix_ cutting edge computer scientist hannon fuller played by the charming armin mueller stahl is murdered his associate douglas hall craig bierko apparently framed and suspected by the police enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery along the way beautiful blonde gretchen mol more bodies and deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture _the thirteenth floor_ unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise the result is movie that is failure from two conventional points of view first its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline second and more seriously it demands that its audience think and feel no wonder it fell through the cracks done in film noir style as murder mystery this is relatively deep movie that functions on several levels many audiences will simply be bewildered by it rather than engaged which is shame because this movie amply repays little emotional and intellectual investment recommend second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie despite its philosophical challenges _the thirteenth floor_ derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller mol and douglas hall bierko as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller in that sense it is more akin to _gattaca_ than _the matrix_ which for all of its cute philosophical byplay is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever the moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying wrenching and intellectually challenging in its final moments the film even takes on itself when david jane husband who has come to enjoy killing accuses her of being the sick one although there is victory for the leading characters this resolution suggests disturbing element of fantasy in jane and thus deep seated character flaw in fact hannon fuller activities in the simulated world the behavior of jane husband and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters this is not film of good people beset from without by great evil the tragedy is not in their stars but in themselves the major actors all of whom are required to play two or even three roles perform extremely well bierko who will be familiar as the psycho from _the long kiss goodnight_ is outstanding onofrio as whitney who plays pivotal role in support also turns in good performance the lovely gretchen mol whose elegance integrity and determination suggest bergman in _casablanca_ does wonderful job her voice however lacks the necessary weight at times this could be because she was given the worst lines in movie whose major weakness is the script some minor flaws hairline cracks in fine porcelain appear in places there are one or two instances of jerky editing the script takes the edge off the film climaxes the atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic at times yet there is clue there too one wonders if even after two decades _blade runner_ is still casting its long shadow over sci fi films one can see group of suits in their suite waving their hands imperiously at directors like the emperor in _amadeus_ make it more like_blade runner_ you know dark and rainy _the thirteen floor_ is that rare exception among hollywood movies rich emotionally satisfying intelligent sci fi movie and yet ultimately it proves the suits right for when good sci fi is made where is the sf community turning out in droves to see it if we don support great sf who will
tone alone cannot sustain film but it can go long way if can find myself lost in the time and place of story it scores immediate style points when that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting the effect can be described best by an adjective do not use lightly literary what eating gilbert grape is such film it rich memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility staged in manner which many viewers might find too prosaic but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence gilbert grape johnny depp is young man living in rural endora iowa facing incredible responsibilities as the man of the house since his father suicide gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store he also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie leonardo dicaprio and help care for his extremely overweight mother darlene cates gilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky juliette lewis free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down as he spends time with becky gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing slowly his resentment builds until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people director lasse hallstrom my life as dog and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges screenplay based on his own novel endora is town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else the midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real minor characters like crispin glover as the town mortician are vividly realized and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen desperately unhappy housewife one of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of burger franchise attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off key high school band not single note in the depiction of endora rang false the same can be said of the character of gilbert it testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line when becky responds to gilbert description of his father with knew someone like that once gilbert is man harboring an ever growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty in one scene he allows local children to look at his mother through their window displaying her like side show attraction his entire life seems to be mocked by arnie repeated chants of we re not going anywhere but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer and it becomes clear that he is following in his father footsteps in this regard johnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface but he never gives in to one dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny joon and edward scissorhands depp performance is overshadowed however by leonardo dicaprio astonishing oscar nominated supporting work as arnie he puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real dicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard pressed to spot flaw darlene cates first time actor brings real pain to her scenes as gilbert tortured mother and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert sisters only juliette lewis doesn quite click playing critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark gilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion but it never lost me thanks to lovingly created setting and marvelous cast this 1993 release proves well worth the wait
hollywood has 750 batting average with elmore leonard adaptations last year touch was ill conceived and just plain odd but get shorty jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies steven soderburgh master of sex lies and videotape now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery prison double crossing uncut diamonds and oh yeah true love george clooney is the protagonist risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker but for once didn want to slap the taste out of his mouth he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant type perfected in hitchcock movies the kind of guy to whom crime is just profession like any other nowhere present is clooney usual ain sexy sneer there just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style clooney is definitely perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty clooney plays man who robbed about 200 banks without ever using gun in the opening scene he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm of course he gets caught so it not all good it while doing time in florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate albert brooks in frightful bald wig collection of diamonds in detroit clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans meanwhile there jennifer lopez unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda she finally graduated to worthy role as the marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes rhames is waiting to give him ride in stolen car and lopez makes it threesome her hostage ass locked in trunk with clooney he covered in dirt and has gun to her neck and it little cramped in there but they manage to make love connection anyway probably because it movie the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir ish crime story the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime and this is no exception although they re not really germane to the plot lopez relationship with her father dennis farina of get shorty rhames relationship with his christian sister you could call her sister christian and pop in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to movie already full of it out of sight spans at least three years but has non linear structure focusing on the jailbreak brooks score and flashing back to earlier times this is movie with brain as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves the entire cast does the material justice clooney and lopez coming into their own and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites here hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch serving america for almost 20th of century
renown surrealist director the 77 year old frenchman alain resnais hiroshima mon amour last year at marienbad lo has created lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven 1978 tv serial 1981 movie and the singing detective 1986 the film follows potter gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts he also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct such as the umbrellas of cherbourg and the young girls of rochefort the tale has resnais unique touches as director to go along with his homage it is satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person and that there is song in everyone heart for every occasion what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers and the farce seems more banal than daring yet it is not without its striking moments and charms such as when jane birkin does cameo and sings one of her own songs also the glossy amberlike photography added very french romantic feeling to the story while the mood of paris as being place for love to flourish above all else which has always been embellished in movie lore comes through with flying colors it also does good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there it tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness they are the attractive sisters odile sabine az ma and camille agnes jaoui with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on bourgeois life of material comforts she is married to the glum and laconic claude pierre arditi she once went out with businessman nicolas jean pierre bacri who left her years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent flat for his family simon andre dussolier works as real estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas flat in his spare time he writes radio plays simon boss is the much younger unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier lambert wilson who inherited the firm from his father and is the real estate agent selling more luxurious and larger flat with better view to odile but fails to tell her that building project is going up soon that will block her view screenwriters and actors jean pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts jaoui camille is university scholar finishing up ph in history using for her thesis the study of the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru she works as tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks even though she appears to have outwardly perfect self control on her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her but not having the nerve to tell her this to his dismay he finds out she is dating his mean spirited but handsome boss whom she meets when looking at her sister new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from cold not because he so sensitive bacri as the classy nicolas turns out to be now working as chauffeur he is hypochondriac with history of depression who visits many doctors until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him odile still pines for him but he married telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly love is the same old song that makes the world go round even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are everything comes together in bourgeois housewarming party for odile place as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be there not lot of bite to this satirical musical but resnais has never made bad film and is one of the best current french directors if not the best this film is not one his great ones but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but some males even sing in female voice while some females sing in male voice it is also interesting in the way it examines its characters behavior as being similar in business as in love
there seem to be two reactions to dark city you either love it or you are unimpressed count me as love it as good as the crow and spawn are dark city is better where the former two have specific comic book following the latter is an original work with the potential for broader appeal it has similar look to the others but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent not clever or complex the story is still fascinating like selection from the twilight zone man rufus sewell is awakened in his bathtub by man with syringe surprised the attacker runs off the dazed man gets out of the tub and finds woman body in the room mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately so he packs some clothes and leaves never sure why he leaving or what he fleeing ghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the dark city hounding him like figures in nightmare an odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough to check his the amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his name is john murdoch now if only he could remember the rest of his life dark city is good on many levels first the look of the movie is excellent give credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating coherent look from diverse elements there are visual elements from the american 1920s 60s mixed with dickens era urban industrial elements it is all pulled together in sad dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hopper painting nighthawks proyas use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film world for not only does the audience see the city model but so do the ghouls the look is like cross between tim burton batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay second the editing of the film is good the pacing is on track and the plot is revealed the amnesia explained in satisfying increments also the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie tense caffeinated look third the special effects are well used they look good but more importantly the right effects are used for the right job one example stands out in my mind the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically simple ripple effect is used more showy effect could have been chosen but then it would have just been gratuitous restraint was shown where necessary letting the more critical effects look more impressive finally like gattaca dark city spends just little effort striving for mythical significance unlike gattaca the story is just open ended and non literal enough to be successful john murdoch recovery from amnesia is tied to the passing of the night and the hopeful coming of the dawn his struggle with amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all mankind at least in his world when we finally see the big picture of the movie world it is as mysterious as the iroquois image of the world being carried on the back of giant turtle few minor flaws keep me from giving this movie the same perfect score roger ebert gave but do strongly recommend it for its look its pace its story and its timelessness
time bandits from director terry gilliam is very different fantasy action adventure movie about group of time traveling dwarves led by randall david rappaport who have stolen map of the universe this map contains time hole that if exploited enable the men to travel back and forth through time the supreme being of the universe ralph richardson is the former employer of these treasure seeking bandits and he wishes desperately to regain the map during the travels he appears as ghostly face demanding that they return the map that they have stolen but according to randall they are just borrowing it kevin young boy who seems quite bored with his life is unexpectedly brought into the schemes of the little men when they appear in his room which has portal for time traveling he joins up with the men and becomes part of their gang following them on their robberies their first victim is napoleon ian holm whom they rob during battle that he is commanding from here the group travels to the middle ages meeting up with robin hood himself eventually kevin is separated from the group and travels to an egyptian time where he is taken in by king agamemnon played by sean connery kevin accidentally saved the king life and the king wishes to have kevin as his son but the group of bandits find kevin and transport onto the deck of the titanic meanwhile the evil genius david warner is watching the group from fortress of ultimate darkness attempting to find way in order to bring the men and the map to him when randall learns of the fortress of ultimate darkness which supposedly contains the most fabulous object in the world the dollar signs seemingly appear on his eyes as he is convinced that they must travel there once inside the fortress of ultimate darkness it is unclear as to if any of the men will make it out alive time bandits is fantastically made film that caters to the imagination of anyone with terrific soundtrack courtesy of george harrison whom also was an executive producer time bandits is sure to be very surrealistic time traveling adventure with unforgettable characters that is sure to entertain anyone terry gilliam however does not utilize that greatly his trademark ability in moviemaking during this film although this does not affect the film that greatly and finally if you liked labyrinth you ll love time bandits
making sequel to widely beloved film is weighty proposition indeed especially when the first film is considered by many to be masterpiece when it comes to living up to expectations filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure for sequel to live up to or even surpass the original greatness is very rare indeed and whereas babe pig in the city misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe it is worthy companion piece more than that it is spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right babe pig in the city warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like the godfather part ii and the empire strikes back as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced babe pig in the city picks up precisely where babe left off having won the sheep herding competition farmer hoggett james cromwell and his pig are elevated to fame status series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city in doing so the film transports us into wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original babe pig in the city flourishes where so many sequels fail most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film not babe pig in the city this is completely original tale that offers up story drastically different than the first also by not being content to utilize most of the old characters this film gives us many new ones to enjoy in essence it doesn attempt to copy itself instead it strives to achieve an originality of its own and it succeeds that not to say the familiar is absent babe pig in the city retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film along with babe himself ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride as does mrs hoggett one of this decade best and most underappreciated comic characterizations hilariously performed by magda szubanski the three singing mice also make the journey chiming in with their cute high pitched vocals the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice from there we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne soothingly deep narrative composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting while staying at the flealands hotel babe encounters veritable ark full of new animals monkeys kittens and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new urbanites that babe befriends as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter each character is distinctly unique some of which are imbued with personal human like struggles that are endearing and touching and while this world focuses largely on these animals we are introduced to two new human characters as well mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel an animal loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors stein landlady is wonderfully odd caricature we also meet fugly floom an old soft spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel utilizing them as part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was so as not to ruin this well kept secret won reveal the actor identity here it was treat indeed to see one of cinema legends grace the screen again in what was superbly gentle and heartwarming performance the greatest triumph of babe pig in the city is the art direction simply put it bleeds creativity taking the look of the original film to whole new level restricted primarily to farm the first time around this second installment creates an entire city dazzling us with unique fable like architecture but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world architectural landmarks designing skyline that includes the statue of liberty the sydney opera house the brooklyn bridge the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower ford has created singular city that encompasses all of our cities as seen in the film photo and pre production drawing to your right added to that many of this city streets are the twin siblings of venice gondola trekked rivers the metropolis that has sprung from ford vision is wondrous sight to behold it is world that you want to walk around in norma moriceau costume designs belong in this world vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford landscape most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom clown outfit andrew lesnie photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film multiple emotional tones much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of babe pig in the city reports stated that its original cut was branded with pg 13 rating these reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned pg rating but even so to be anything harsher than the original rating had many parents and fans up in arms by deleting minimal number of shots babe pig in the city was eventually given the coveted rating although appeased many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself well to coin phrase the reports of babe pig in the city death at the hands of dark scary felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated granted it has its moments of pseudo morbidity but all in all babe pig in the city is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be whatever dark moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller the mad max trilogy the witches of eastwick lorenzo oil having served as producer and co writer on the first film miller moves into the director chair for this one putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise the story of babe pig in the city is an enchanting yarn but one that doesn achieve the emotional or character depth of the original missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity an individual worth challenging conformity and one purpose in life babe dealt with this weighty subject matter creating timeless fable babe pig in the city should not have rehashed these themes but do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife class differences sacrificial courage and so on but this film goals aren as lofty as the first instead choosing to take more straightforward approach allowing its themes to take back seat to an exciting sometimes intense fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive babe pig in the city also decides against developing relationship to the level of which was present in the first film specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe hoggett love for babe which grew ever so gently is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality best exemplified in hoggett dance for babe this moving relationship was truly unique it is something that wish would have been present again and could have through fugly floom but was not please understand these are not negative criticisms per se but simply statements of what see as the differences between babe pig in the city being very good film and the original being great one but having said that these observations are minor critiques at best as an overall piece babe pig in the city is thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end sure it isn great film but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness it is film that is magical with its charm and humor exciting in its adventurous exploits funny with its dry wit and cute voices and breathtaking in its presentation babe pig in the city may not be moviemaking at its absolute best but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema as result if you choose to let this film pass you by you will be missing of the year best cinematic treats
let me first say that the conditions that was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal so have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal watched the matrix in theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times under no circumstances should it have ever been allowed to show big budget special effects laden film like the matrix this theater owned by the parent company of one of hollywood biggest studios hasn even graduated into stereo sound yet the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age in other words the sound sucked as someone used to digital sound in movie theater bad sound doesn do anything to add to film not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together there ve had my rant now on with the regularly scheduled review which sadly won include commentary on the film sound which assuming was spectacular but just guessing my guess on the sound seems like fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix it is nothing short of stunning visually sadly the rest of the film while pretty good doesn quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good the matrix has at it core good concept although it strays into the confusing side more often than would have liked keanu reeves plays computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just hoax it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in sort of incubator plugged into computer network the computers are generating virtual reality world which is representation of the earth before it was destroyed the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose that is except small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie reeve character neo is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus laurence fishburne newcomer carrie anne moss and one of hollywood most underrated actors joe pantoliano join fishburne in the band of freedom fighters the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular this can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor extensive pre production training in martial arts this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in film when you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world it all adds up to an eyeful as already said the visuals far outpace the rest of the film acting in the matrix is not bad but it certainly isn real good either keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances although to his credit it is one of his better performances laurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in sci fi action film more than few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama joe pantoliano was little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had carrie anne moss turned out surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role it nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks you have to give all of the main actors healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film it was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue which was terrible at times in more than few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird it almost seems as though the writers were having difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie so they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about thereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability my other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending the setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many bad film before the ending itself was just plain strange the main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this real treat to watch while the rest of the film acting dialogue and to degree plot detract from the high production values they don detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as fun way to spend an evening
mary norton children book series the borrowers has been made into several below average television movies so wasn too enthused as entered the theater for the big screen debut of the minute clan but was in for shock the borrowers is actually thoroughly delightful movie with plenty of good laughs and even some decent special effects the lender family is being thrown out of their longtime home their aunt who owned the property never left will now an unscrupulous lawyer ocious potter john goodman plans to demolish the house and replace it with an ultra modern housing development but the lenders are not alone in their house living under the floorboards is family of borrowers inch tall people who make their living as scavengers from the human beans above the clock family of borrowers is as distressed as the lenders especially once they discover the evil potter actually has copy of the will which leaves the home to the lenders so it is up to the clocks pod jim broadbent and homily celia imrie along with their kids arrietty flora newbigin and peagreen tom felton to recover the will and save the household but when potter learns of the tiny people he enlists the skills of exterminator jeff mark williams to kill off the clan there plenty of attention to detail in the borrowers especially in the furnishings of the clock family house made out of lost board game parts and credit cards the background details are nearly as rich as the entertaining story the various predicaments of the clock family are clever and thrilling based on an original story the screenwriters did good job at imagining all the potential and unusual perils that could exist for inch tall person as the villain john goodman performance veers on the edge of being over the top but his performance suits the role well and he does very well in the film many slapstick moments with nearly seamless mix of oversized sets bluescreen shots and cgi the special effects in the borrowers are very well done there are few times when you can spot the effects at work but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspension of disbelief hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of being labeled children only movie for it is surprisingly entertaining and fun to watch
with the opening scene of young couple in van pulling up loading their guns kissing each other and uttering what sounds like rock and roll actually it lock and load you can help thinking tarantino and of course with its storyline of crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie clyde to natural born killers but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction exploring modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run normal life takes much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon inspired by true events we ve heard that one before and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated or so strangely poignant for this is story of real people whose lives take on steadily unreal quality who in their search for normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged beginning with their final arrest the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris luke perry policeman and pam ashley judd factory worker they fall in love and marry but pam increasingly erratic behaviour going on spending sprees slashing herself with knife after an argument begin to trouble the solid and stable chris when chris gets sacked they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up then chris begins to rob banks luke perry accomplishes the not inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer moustached with tough paternal look and yet voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation he is perfectly cast as the long suffering husband it another of john mcnaughton coups of casting against type after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness making pam into fascinating yet often infuriating person if the performance falls short of greatness however it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually staple of cinema whether it in betty mavi tom viv or georgia as in those movies there the danger that the performance seems mannered collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece judd doesn entirely avoid this pitfall but pam craziness is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more normal chris when pam reacts to her father in law death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones chris face is the picture of pained restraint of course it the question of what is normal that is asked in normal life mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity it is the rational chris that loves guns shooting is about precision control and the crazy pam that loves astronomy and yearns for dog who is then called chaos chaos and you and me we re real family she notes wryly it is chris methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such successful bank robber his well planned disguise as bearded roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery huge sign on shopping mall stands out in the background buy more the perfectly respectable consumption crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases and both of them into desperate situations it not perfect film some of the dialogue is touch too banal perhaps intentionally the use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film indeed as in mcnaughton seminal film henry portrait of serial killer it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre that gives this determinedly unflashy moving film its great strengths mcnaughton has filmed this story with quiet coolly realistic method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer the suburbs with their miles of white fenced houses and identikit malls take on sense of claustrophobic blankness in its very different way this makes for as haunting backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick badlands while pam shares the yearnings of malick heroes to escape from ordinary life chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead normal life their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies but these are dreams defined by constrained by and even doomed by the limitations of the normal conventional world pam final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs where wild bushes grow symbolically the frontier the outer limits of her society but also quite literally the end of the road where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement the flying inkpot rating system wait for the video little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
this dumb cowboy blondie who thinks he is `darn good loverboy decides to leave his dusty ol town somewhere in texas and go to new york he puts on his beloved cowboy attire and off he hops on the next new york coach when he arrives to new york he immediately sets out to play mr playboy thinking he is the best `darn `stud in the whol new york city obviously he fails he meets the cripple rico dustin hoffman who is terrifically good in bar rico has leg that is paralysed from the knee down so he walks in peculiar way rico is thief and wants to get some money off this rich dumb cowboy he cheats our cowboy out of $20 through somewhat detailed routine and disappears soon our cowboy runs out of money he gets kicked out of his hotel and starts getting hungry walking through the city with everybody talkin playing in the background oh and his prided techno transistor radio in hand he spots rico in cafe rico half scared pours out all the money in his pocket 60 filthy cents our cowboy hungry is forgiving he is glad he found someone he knows rico offers to make it up for him and he invites him to his place and what filthy cold place it is our cowboy falls asleep instantly in the junk bed when he finally wakes jumps up he finds rico looking at him you wanna cup coffee rico asks in his friendly sleazy somewhat childish manner while he smokes on ciggy what re you goddamn faggot what do you want from me where are my shoes what did you do to them but all his doubts turn out to be unfounded rico really has heart together they live in the junk apartment and almost freeze to death rico is convinced that the best place to be is florida where the sun shines beautifully and there are lots of coconut trees but he falls sick and is convinced that his cure is to go to florida we will soon be in miami is the last sentence uttered in this film and what shocking moving end of film it is the classic theme music midnight cowboy helps bring about the feeling of attachment that most viewers will experience towards the end of the film whether the attachment is to the two main characters or to their dreams is probably as debatable as whether it was the acting or the direction that makes this film so memorable
the sweet hereafter could serve as textbook example of the difference between television movies and real movies consider for moment what television producer would do with book that features fatal school bus accident and lawyer out to sign up the bereaved lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste top flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety based on respected book of the same name by author russell banks the movie represents rethinking of the story structure not merely literal adaptation of the novel told in linear form by four narrators in the book egoyan version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without narrator the author is even on record as applauding egoyan changes in the press notes the book author describes the story as parable of lost children he says it asks what town does in the absence of its children picking up on this egoyan has flashback in which sitter nicole burnell played with grace by sarah polley reads parts of the pied piper from an old illustrated book to her two charges periodically throughout the picture nicole readings are heard in voice over you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment they and the rest of the town children come into harm way some live and others are seriously injured and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss ian holm in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career plays mitchell stephens an intense man of quiet misery mitchell is the outsider in the story set in small snow encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness his mission there is singular one to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone anyone on their behalf if this seems crass well it is but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of religious zealot the story unfolds slowly and always believably each little aspect has its own fascination as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson he has simple task he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has lost child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit wendell ticks off one town member after another and then as one can in small town enumerates each person numerous faults although the town is no peyton place people there do have their foibles one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell bruce greenwood who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good bye to his kids well single parent billy fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story the accident itself simple one of bus hitting patch of ice isn shown until the middle of the picture but nevertheless the mystery about it builds throughout the film although the picture is no detective story finding out exactly what happened is subtheme in movie that is primarily character study of town gripped by tragedy as the injured bus driver gabrielle rose dolores driscoll plays the role of dedicated individual who loves kids with passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning to round out the story mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear his daughter zoe caerthan banks is drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half way house and recovery center after another fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk can help you mitchell tries to reassure billy not unless you can raise the dead billy snaps back mitchell pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder mychael danna haunting music sets the stage for tragedy the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur but it is in the warm shadowy intimate moments indoors where it works best the show which is ripe for emotional manipulation never plays with its audience still when the house lights go up you may feel as did could barely breathe was so overcome by the sum total of what had witnessed more than anything the film is like master painting each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint with the final color in place the masterpiece is complete and the ending credits roll the sweet hereafter runs 50 it is rated for mature themes sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers
it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his artificial intelligence just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home an outcast seeking family themes very familiar from most of spielberg body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan naming just few examples is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions and with the number of births limited by the government many couples are yearning for children and professor hobby william hurt has the solution robotic boy named david haley joel osment who is programmed to love as test david is placed with henry swinton sam robards and his wife monica frances connor their natural born son has been cryogenically frozen until cure can be found for his illness the first third of deals with david life with the swintons and how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son martin circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons he is abandoned and alone david highly influenced by the fairy tale pinocchio feels that if he becomes real boy he can rekindle monica love for him the film second act follows david search for the mavi fairy whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish during these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe jude law robot who specializes in sex spielberg is at his top form in this sequence offering brutal flesh fair where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers here is where kubrick influence is strongly felt as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots the savagery conjures up images from the late director clockwork orange at about two hours and 30 minutes the film begins to falter during the last 20 minutes sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters it is all very anti climatic and jarring these scenes seem almost superfluous as if from different film is dark fairy tale that deserves its pg 13 rating it is story combining hope and intolerance sacrifice and bigotry and while it does not coalesce perfectly the movie does offer some disturbing images but is really showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination it is this lad who brings sense of joy and wonder to the role of david being created for the express purpose of loving he shines when with monica beaming with love as eager as puppy to please after being left in the woods he is confused lost hurt focusing on one objective to become real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mother eyes law is pleasant as the care free robot who really doesn understand david quest but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey probably the toughest role is connor monica playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as substitute for her lost martin she grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins to perceive david not as second chance but as threat to her family she gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action many of futuristic sets are breathtaking especially mostly submerged new york lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice caps is flawed film and you cannot get through the entire feature without pondering even subconsciously how it would have turned out with kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera would it have been darker more cynical we will never know we can only judge what is before us on the screen collaboration of two cinematic giants is most interesting and thought provoking examination of future that is quickly gaining on us
couple of months ago when first downloaded the face off trailer from the net my initial reaction was fourteen carrot altin yawn followed swiftly by press of my computers delete key not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss poor trailer then started reading the first wave of reviews from the unique excellent must see well thought still skeptical suppose might as well go see it when it gets here here of course was still three months away ll admit when trotted off to see this film the only john woo movie had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled but his films were definitely not on my must see list that let me tell you has changed completely knew this fact only five minutes into the film after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick seriously ve never been big john travolta fan but he like cage perfectly suited his role in the movie sorry make that roles in the movie even travolta great performance however paled in comparison to cage character portrayals my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler hideout half drugged out of his mind he sits there reclining back in chair talking about his son death from castor perspective doesn it just break your heart he mutters coldly now don go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is drama focused movie it not that what really makes this movie unique it an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters not common mix at all suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though that the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other and never hit several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press rewind and watch it over again the part where archer and troy have stand off on either side of double sided mirror is just plain brilliant whilst cage and travolta performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies the lesser characters are just as intriguing joan allen who usually sticks to the straight drama movies plays her part perfectly as archer long suffering wife like the fact that her character didn end up toting gun at the end of the movie it would have wrecked her potrayal gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy mistreated girlfriend make that one of castor troy mistreated girlfriends other movies would have used her character as just window dressing sex object but instead her character is very strong and independent dominique swain who plays archer daughter also does nice job though her character is not as explored as much as allen or gershon faults well there were some have to say first the movie ending whilst being very good overall was bit too drawn out for it own good after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can help but think geez are you guys nuclear powered or what there were certain bits that weren handled properly like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform prison more explanation here would have been nice overall this movie was not perfect but thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made certainly hope so
edward zwick the siege raises more questions than it can convincingly answer or even clearly articulate its subject is the rising threat of terrorism in american cities denzel washington is anthony hub hubbard who runs the fbi anti terrorism task force in new york his investigation into arab terrorist cells intensifies when suicide bombers take out busload of people hub focuses on mysterious cia operative annette bening whose goes by both elise and sharon as the terrorist attacks continue and the body count rises the question of martial law is raised enter general devereaux bruce willis who opposes martial law at first but who as soon as the president decides to send in the army begins herding arab immigrants into prison camp and attacking every link that hub uncovers in the terrorist chain hub listens as devereaux tortures and murders suspect the future zwick and screenwriter lawrence wright offer is all too possible what would happen they ask if terrorism became as much fact of daily life in new york as it is in cities like beirut and belfast what would happen to our civil liberties if soldiers patrol our streets with machine guns these questions the siege answers in realistic detail it implies tougher ones though what can be done to combat terrorism without sacrificing justice and freedom if we encourage terrorism abroad from bening character we discover that the cia trained the bombers will it inevitably come back to us siege avoids the tougher questions by endowing its hero hub with uncompromising sense of clear right and wrong this comforting fantasy of sir galahad confronting the evils of the modern world is an escape from the thought provoking issues the movie raises still zwick deserves credit for at least addressing the issue with as much realism as he does where so many movies willis die hard series for example offer only comic book view on terrorism

remember seeing the trailer of the siyah cauldron on the pinocchio video it really scared me and didn want to go see it however after heard about how wonderful it was wanted to see it didn get chance to do so until now the film disney 25th animated feature opens with menacing shot of great siyah cauldron unshrouded by mist as narrator begins to tell the tale long time ago in the land of prydain there was king so evil that his spirit was captured in the cauldron it has been hidden for centuries and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors and with them rule the world and destroy it then we meet farmer wizard dallben and his young apprentice taran taran dreams of being warrior instead of being `pig keeper they have pig named hen wen one day as he gives hen wen nice warm bath the pig goes crazy and dallben then realizes after watching hen wen thoughts through bucket of water that taran must hide hen wen in the forest an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the siyah cauldron and only hen wen has the power to show its location taran leads hen wen into the forest but of course he loses her and tries to go find her along the way he meets up with mischievous little creature named gurgi who desires `munchings and crunchings much to his dismay besides he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen when he hears hen wen squeal from far away though he races to her rescue only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king castle from far away taran climbs the castle walls and brings himself into the castle where he attempts to rescue hen wen he manages to do so but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon there he meets princess eilonwy and her magic bauble another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron and the two escape through the deep castle walls along the way taran finds sword in burial chamber and they rescue comic bard named fflewdurr flamm who has harp whose strings break whenever he tells lie the three manage to escape the horned king castle but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic as they rest in the forest gurgi reappears claiming to have found hen wen trail he leads taran eilonwy and fflewdurr by way of `pig tracks to whirlpool suddenly they all get sucked under and they meet the fairy like fairfolk taran is reunited with hen wen and informed that the siyah cauldron is hidden in the land of morva he then devises crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world with the help of grumpy fairy named doli the four travelers manage to find themselves at mysterious cottage it turns out to be no ordinary cottage three comically strange witches inhabit the place when taran tells them that they are searching for the siyah cauldron they agree to let him have it in exchange for his sword taran agrees much to eilonwy horror but at least they get the siyah cauldron but the cauldron can be destroyed only its evil powers can be stopped the only way to do so is for living being to climb into it of his own free will never to return alive things take turn for the worse when the horned king henchmen capture taran eilonwy and fflewdurr along with the siyah cauldron and lead them back to the castle taran eilonwy and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors this is the most horrifying scene in the film because here dead army comes alive just when all seems lost though gurgi reappears and rescues taran eilonwy and fflewdurr taran is about to jump into the siyah cauldron but gurgi stops him not wanting him to throw his life away gurgi then jumps into the siyah cauldron and the deathless warriors decay taran tries to find way to rescue gurgi but he is forced to do battle against the horned king he kicks the horned king away who is then magically sucked into the siyah cauldron where its powers immediately destroy him completely taran eilonwy and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king castle just as it self destructs the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless siyah cauldron away but fflewdurr stops them saying that they `never give anything away they bargain in response to this the witches offer taran his sword back but taran instead has new trade the cauldron for gurgi the trade is made gurgi seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group as taran cradles him in his arms though gurgi stirs he is not dead after all the happy group then returns home where hen wen brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past dallben and even doli await their triumphant return as spectacular as it sounds the siyah cauldron really suffered lot in its past times before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions he had bought novel by lloyd alexander called the siyah cauldron sword and sorcery tale for the studio bringing this book to the screen was the studio fondest dream miller who entitled himself as the executive producer promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio the animators were struggling to complete the siyah cauldron by this time things had gone really rocky for the animation department many of the studio old men had retired or died therefore the animators suffered hard time making this film originally budgeted at $25 million the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything and when it was finally released on june 24 1985 the siyah cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics but somehow the film flopped the film was rated pg and the film although `disneyfied from lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain which is what this film is based on was much more scarier and darker than disney other previous efforts such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it in addition other critics rejected it for having `no heart and `unmemorable compared to other disney animated features but whatever the real reason the siyah cauldron was financial disaster grossing only $21 million the failure of the film grounded the studio animation department and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale and it seemed like animated features would no longer become part of the studio reputation the next two disney animated features the great mouse detective and oliver and company although little more lighthearted than the siyah cauldron didn do much better although oliver and company grossed much more than the siyah cauldron and the great mouse detective only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features as for the siyah cauldron it was rereleased in some cities for temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron finally the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released because of all this you might ask yourself was the siyah cauldron really such bad movie the people who had seen the film didn think so in fact many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film but of course they denied it for while it seemed like the siyah cauldron would never be released to video until september 1997 disney released the siyah cauldron to video in the united kingdom few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc including me and for those who hadn seen the film yet am included here they got quite treat but people who had bootleg copies of the siyah cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get rating in the uk the rating means universal suitable for all ages kinda like their own version of somewhere online team of diehard the siyah cauldron fans signed petition that said `bring back the siyah cauldron and because of that disney finally decided to release the video to the united states before that time rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed like the uk video so that it would get rating and that they would add in songs those rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the siyah cauldron would be released in its pg rated version even still when it was finally released to the us some reaction was mixed some felt that it was indeed cut but some felt that it wasn but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable since film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available as for myself when saw the movie for the first time on converted ntsc video didn expect much at all in fact had heard so many mediocre things about it that didn think the film would ever be such good film much to my surprise when saw the first few minutes of the film was asking myself this is the same film everyone saw the one that flopped at the box office the one that critics and filmgoers alike called bad movie this doesn seem like all of the above instead it classic in its own right the film has wonderful cast of characters there taran grant bardsley an assistant pig keeper who would rather be warrior than pig keeper the story hero the critics have said that taran is not likeable at all but the opposite is true he is brave loyal and eventually learns lesson about friendship later on there likeable character here not that he the only likeable character in the film there gurgi john biner lovable little uh thing who remains loyal to taran even though they don quite hit it off at first but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman dwarf named creeper phil fondacairo who is loyal to the film imaginative and sinister villain the horned king voiced gruesomely by john hurt yet he also fears his neck the other characters including the sidekicks spunky but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm and three comically wicked witches who hide dark secret although pleasant and likeable aren quite as well rounded as they should be the story itself is an adventurous one quest involving the mystical pig hen wen the siyah cauldron itself and an army of deathless ones with everything hooking opening to spectacular finale elmer bernstein music also tells the story perfectly in dark yet calming manner the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios even though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good like the ground opening when the siyah cauldron rises out of the earth the animation overall is top notch overall this film is an entertaining endeavor fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get kick out of this one except young kids there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney other films although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary which is the main reason why this film is rated pg fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie even though it doesn have all of the ingredients of true disney film this film is classic in its own right and deserves far better chance than what it has been given that better chance has finally come whatever reason about why the siyah cauldron was such big failure seems to have disappeared and the film has finally achieved its place among disney most proudest achievements can help but think though whatever would have happened if the siyah cauldron was box office success
in october of 1962 the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u2 spy plane fly overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles from the us president john kennedy bruce greenwood and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in thirteen days one of the highlights to come out of made for tv movies was 1974 entry called missiles of october that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown that teleplay starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in 1962 now quarter of century after the landmark tv movie director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again the last time was for the taught spy thriller no way out to re enact the events of that most dangerous time in america and the world history taken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth donnell costner donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event once again as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war as donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning he deals with the usual family crises and problems meanwhile u2 spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment suddenly ken routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat where thirteen days differs most from missiles of october is as expected in the scope of the project there is big difference budget wise between making television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen it shows as the makers of thirteen days craft recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the beyaz house it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation the cast true ensemble is led surprisingly by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner costner donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family this puts personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe but he knows that if the crisis comes to head his family will be no more the meat of thirteen days is in the big picture not the microcosm of family though this is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels the story does not just cover the face off between the world two most powerful countries it also depicts the animosity between the president and the military cia the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro the missile crisis becomes struggle for power as the army navy air force want to flex their might and invade cuba while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with america dignity and world leadership intact while the internal battle for power rages in the beyaz house with air force chief curtis lemay kevin conway advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with blockade of offensive weapons to cuba this is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action when the first confrontation takes place between us warship and soviet freighter the tension is palpable the most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u2 is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an anti aircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane this is sweaty palm sequence to say the least making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles the ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players greenwood does not play act at being caricature of jfk foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent instead he plays the man as powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options kennedy used this decision by committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available to the president costner as ken donnell is really supporting cast member as kennedy crony brought on board as personal political favor costner plays donnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches with forced kennedyesque twang to his speech the rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy the rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast too standing out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador to the un adlai stevenson who was forced to become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and remember the confrontation vividly the filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson with accuracy using old style video footage to good effect dylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara kevin conway gives his general lemay the right bomb them to hell attitude also notable is christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who with his wingman takes on the dangerous mission of low level photo recon into the heart of cuba bravely challenging kenny donnell admonition don get shot tech credits are superb across the board with an admirable depiction of the us armed forces being placed on war footing it an impressive production with the careful use of period aircraft and ships that gives the film veracity fitting the event solid costuming by isis mussenden is subtle but has the look of the kennedys there is the usual array of vintage cars from the period to make things look right the special of the u2 sequences are nice crafting of computer imaging the cuban missile crisis is probably the most intense two weeks that the united states has ever faced in its survival as world leader helmer donaldson and his fine crew and cast have given the depiction of this crucial event with the care and attention to details that make this one of the finest docudramas of the year give thirteen days an
dark city is such rare treat it stunning hyperkinetic vision of place where our reality is fused with noir science fiction and the darkest nights in manhattan and london to boot it is accompanied by an intense well written and thoughtful story movies of this caliber and idea aren made too often and it unfortunate that waited this long to see it alex proyas who previous film the crow looked good but couldn cover up the terrible acting or story here shows near masterpiece combination of metropolis edward hopper and phillip marlowe fused seemlessly at times it moves beyond film into artwork it is the story of strangers aliens from another planet and we know they re aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats one of the detractions of the film who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live what makes up our soul these aliens are superior to humans because they have mastered the ultimate technology of shaping matter with their mind called tuning they are aided by human scientist played by kiefer sutherland who has betrayed his kind and at the start of the film watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight during this time john murdoch played swiftly by rufus sewell wakes in bathtub in room with swinging overhead light terrific visual effect not only is murdoch confused but so is the audience without memory and strange guilt that he may be killer he receives phone call to flee as the strangers are after him don want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story one of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop in way regaining murdoch identity along with him it pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography murdoch wife anna is introduced through stunning beam of light she is lounge singer who sings into bright spotlight shadows outlines of men in hats watch as she gently curves through the shine we see the outline of her body from behind an hourglass as she sings slow rhythmic song great entrance however film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied the city is nice to look at but if it poor story then it not worth watching blade runner was popular not only because it visuals but it story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience it is discussed it and argued therefore success other science fiction films of recent times such as the fifth element are nice to look at but are dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy we re left with love conquers all after finishing the fifth element dark city is not so easily explained away as the strangers discovered locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is not such an easy task where is reality dark city is certainly the best science fiction film of the 90 and ranks along with the best made in the 80s such as blade runner and the two aliens films perhaps it the best of the both decades it had the darkness of the aliens films as well as the visuals and compelling story of blade runner but moved beyond think because the themes behind it were much stronger anyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free to write love to hear it
cinema has been around for about hundred years now it not my job to recap this century every time talk about new film but like to think that beginning to understand the art more as watch more films from before my time recently ve seen the films of hitchcock capra fellini godard kurosawa chaplin lang and many others those men were talented artists and their films reflect their genius they are likely to be remembered for well quite while like this film too yes it disaster slash action movie true its budget is lot more money than ll ever see in my lifetime and there not doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make lot of money in fact bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards lousy film had they thought it would ve been more profitable certainly don care what their intentions were because michael bay the rock is such skilled director that doubt he ever make film that is difficult to sit through of course skillful direction doesn complete the package but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together the story is well thought out and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place the acting is terrific the script is sharp and get this there are characters yes you read that right armageddon actually has characters you can care about if you don like this film then you have problem with the genre itself armageddon is as good as film like this can be if you ve seen deep impact then you know the basic framework for the story it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film so it up to the government to stop it why the is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated their plan to send group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid drill down several hundred feet and detonate nuclear warhead within the head driller is harry stamper bruce willis his group of men is colorful bunch including ben affleck chick will patton and rockhound steve buscemi there also an interesting triangle formed between harry and grace liv tyler who is harry daughter and grace are of course romantically intertwined and dad isn too happy with the situation it absurd to wish for complicated story in an event movie or special effects movie or whatever it is you like to call armageddon it not about story it about viscera and action and thrills minute and all that stuff it incidental really that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds thought to what actually happens but bay is the one to congratulate in this case for he has made film so entertaining and so visually sharp that doubt any director could have done it better think most of the budget went to cameras alone because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles take the spectacular opening scene for instance in which meteor shower obliterates new york meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into building which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars the action itself might take five seconds in real life but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways like his quick edit style because it abrasive and exhausting to watch it also very loud and obnoxiously noisy at times but it fun to be obnoxious sometimes the special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame deep impact visually has absolutely nothing on armageddon and to offer comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable special effects are very important in film like this if they re not good then the image is not convincing and the film doesn work everything here looks bright and explosive from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid the effects that don look totally real are still pleasure to behold and credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice looking that it actually qualifies as art of course all of this would add up to little more than an above average light show if didn get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action the film is two and half hours long and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters subplots won suggest that these are complex characters but their problems are real and the emotions aren put forth in sentimental and overbearing way in fact there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up and that lot more than can say about deep impact which was banking on the feel good parts of its story bruce willis is terrific and glad to see him bigger than life again recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing tyler and affleck are great together and make convincing couple all of the scenes between them work on comfortable level patton who is magnificent actor thankfully is not wasted here and the minor subplot revolving around his ex wife and son is very moving the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare who plays crazy russian astronaut is nifty and keeps the film lively and funny wasn challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon and don mind too much but the film doesn insult my intelligence it pitched perfectly to entertain which is what all it really wants to do it not mindless and escapist but well crafted cinema it might have been created for the wrong reasons but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good in spite of the producers and the budget not saying that films like this are risky moves what am saying is that armageddon is big loud expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms
as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on day the weary seasick soldiers take deep breath and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat they are unaware of exactly what is going to happen one man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck as the flap falls the battle begins they are trapped like rats in cage and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire amid the chaos of this massacre stands shot that at least for me hangs in the air like the girl in the little kirmizi coat in schindler list soldier clearly missing an arm wanders around the body strewn beach like lost puppy we are not invited to know what he is searching for until he finds it himself he bends over picks up his arm and starts to carry it probably not bothering to ask himself what now saving private ryan is masterfully composed film the direction is out of this world surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar the cinematography by janusz kaminsky is also astounding but be forewarned this is the most violent and graphic film have ever seen the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as film can get the question is does the story and its realism justify the excessive use the answer from my point of view is no braveheart was truly gritty and one would imagine realistic battle film ryan is ten times worse expect disembowelments sucked in skulls heads blown to bits arms and legs flying across the battlefield many in the theater could not bear to watch and it is shame too because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters and academy members saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on day 1944 through into the film primary mission captain miller hanks assembles an man crew and sets off to find missing solider private ryan whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs ryan doesn recieve fourth letter of condolences about her sons that no person should suffer such injustice miller crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor secret hatred for ryan though they don yet know him they resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who doesn have any more or less right to live than any of them this film manages to keep up rapid pace and though there is lot of set up between battles the story continues full speed to the end the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in league of it own spielberg though not student of the quick cut school of filmmaking takes stab at it here and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it bay should pay close attention take copious notes if you want to jump cut every two seconds do it the way spielberg does it in ryan in the end the extremity of the gory violence is not justified by the importance of the film schindler list taught many people the truth about the holocaust it opened eyes sparked debate and study though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before they don amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindler list overall this is just the truest depiction of the old adage war is hell but braveheart dosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something doubt could endure again masterful work marred only by excessive gore
did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in hospital ward with comatose sunny von bulow she is the main narrator of the film in narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder the dramatic trick works as sunny von bulow narrates compelling story of murder sex unhappiness and lawyer moral dilemma as he takes case he thinks he cannot win jeremy irons is claus von bulow in what is his finest role and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history he is as hated as any man alive as cold as cucumber his remorse for his wife comatose condition is nonexistant and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas 1980 the background to the case is such during christmas of 1979 sunny von bulow fell into deep coma from which she recovered and awoke the same situation occured in 1980 only sunny never woke and probably never will when examined it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson convicted and freed on bail he immediately hires alan dershowitz the renowed harvard law professor to acquit him ron silver is magnificent as moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him we follow him through two very different cases the case of the johnson case where two innocent kids are standing on death row for crime they didn commit and von bulow who he still hasn figured out dershowitz doesn know what happened to sunny and he is extremely hesitant to take the case nevertheless he does based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him together with group of law students dershowitz concocts defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed silver performance is one of handful of solid roles in this deep film schroeder directs on many different levels with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz there are flaws at times the film gets overly theatrical yet due to glenn close troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow the use of her comatose body as narrator works here fairly well the flashbacks are good but at times schroeder doesn fill in the blanks the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film and it could have used better ending the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly without any intelligent conclusion the supporting characters are often neglected and dershowitz team should have been allowed to grow character wise but schroeder over simplifies the story and the characters yet for all these flaws the film is deeply engrossing because of irons as von bulow he is brutally evil anti semitic prejudiced arrogant protective he is rotten lying monster whose conviction may have been wrong legally but morally he was to blame irons plays him to cold perfection with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence he is an adulterous liar and cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder however the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife death by years of neglect and coldness however legally did he do the murder schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind with all the character flaws reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent he wants the viewer to make up his own mind schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow in death for all the failed dramatic theatrics this is one that works beautifully we don know what happened that sense of legal ambiguousness along with von bulow obvious moral guilt is why reversalf fortune works in the end von bulow is as sadistic as ever irons is haunting and that is why reversal of fortune is so good

albert brooks saves the day just in the nick of time with very poor summer for movies brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up and does so in positive way while this may not be his finest work the muse still shakes up some delightful humor in albert brook latest comedy he tells story of troubled screenwriter brooks who losing his edge as his business partners say in desperation he goes to see his friend jack jeff bridges who has been very successful screenwriter in the past he asks jack for some help and recieves word of real life muse that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career so brooks seeks the muse named sarah sharon stone and is suckered into buying her expensive food etc as sort of payment the real punch line however doesn come until the end it really makes you wonder how screenwriters really get their ideas could it simply be from friend or bum in the street the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in hilarious manner speaking of brooks he was absolutely hysterical as screenwriter every time he graces the screen can help but start laughing albert has very unique sense of humor that makes him very likeable character the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone she wasn likeable at all brooks had the right idea with her occupation but she never pulled through in way she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak luckily brooks could clean up the mess and cover for stone mishap it was shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance because the muse had the potential to be very authentic comedy on brighter note andie macdowell was also charming as brook wife she is always nice addition as supporting actress because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she in the funniest moments in the muse in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese mean imagine brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice like it was something out of the ordinary it was just plain hilarious it just adds to the satire joke of how directors get ideas brilliant move by brooks as mentioned before the film is satire much like it proceeder bowfinger which came out few weeks before unlike bowfinger this is not mean spirited film that desperate for jokes it rather witty and humorous look at hollywood bowfinger had it moments but had quite few problems that were never worked out but the muse still managed to keep the laughs despite bit of detour by the end of the film you re glad to see good hearty comedy come out of it for once not fully disappointed because the film didn slow down it kept moving even with some flaws thumbs up to brooks for his brave effort think he ll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future
meet joe siyah is your classic boy meets girl boy likes girl boy gets killed in horrible accident supernatural entity takes over boy body supernatural entity falls in love with girl story based on the 1934 film death takes holiday meet joe siyah is well acted romantic drama which explores the meanings of life and love william parrish anthony hopkins is billionaire businessman on the brink of his 65th birthday he has built huge media empire and raised two beautiful daughters allison marcia gay harden and susan claire forlani william has been able to negotiate his way out of many tough spots but he has suddenly begun fearing his own mortality the one situation he won be able to talk his way out of and he has good reason to fear for death himself is stalking him however death has deal to make death has taken possession of man who has recently died brad pitt and wants william to be his guide in holiday among the living in return william gets to live few extra days of course he agrees death under the human name of joe siyah gets to experience life as complete innocent he never before has experienced the simple pleasures of springy matters or peanut butter and he not quite compared for the more complex pleasures when he and susan fall in love but is their affair doomed to an early demise at nearly three hours in length meet joe siyah is little bit on the leisurely side though it never gets boringly lengthy instead the film gets chance to develop some nicely textured characters and situations you get to soak in and enjoy the atmosphere rather than being hurriedly rushed through it the romantic angle works well though surprisingly the interactions between joe siyah and william parrish are more interesting than those with his daughter this is most likely due to anthony hopkins who once again displays his superb acting skills william is desperate man who has had seemingly ideal life and doesn want to let it go by contrast claire forlani is merely the romantic interest she gets to show joe the ropes of love but is hardly as interesting character as joe siyah brad pitt seems bit stilted granted he supposed to be out of place but the overly formal technique used by pitt begins to distract from the role still he is able to hold his own and over the course of the three hours his character begins to grow on you the main character who seems out of place here is drew jake weber an ambitious executive in williams company who is joe black main rival for susan affections weber plays the character with hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash this cartoonish foil an aberration in film filled many more dimensional characters the supernatural elements of the film are handled murkily but never distractingly so we never learn what is the exact nature of death or why he never done something like this before it actually gets bit creepy when death talks to the dying in their own voices accents his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter and the ultimate resolution to one of the film supernatural problems seems well somewhat superficial still even with the film length it was pleasant time at the movies something you wouldn necessarily expect from film about death but one which meet joe siyah delivers anyhow
being the self proclaimed professional film critic that am am somewhat embarrassed to admit that had not seen lawrence of arabia coming soon to dvd until only recently after all it considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai and doctor zhivago so one day friend of mine loaned me copy of the video and sat down and watched it was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the butt numbing hours of its duration but now fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture director editing cinematography art direction music and sound after watching the film again am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen based on the autobiographical writing of british officer lawrence during world war lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence played by then unknown actor peter toole as lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever bored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in dimly lit headquarters building lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be re assigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army lawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war shot in panavision famed super 70mm format the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic it is absolutely breathtaking using stunning cinematography costuming and direction shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in theater in 1962 and watch this story unfold before my eyes every shot is choreographed as portrait living tribute to great land david lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time far cry from its pathetic uncreative existence today after watching the film the first thing that came to my mind was ve got to do remake of this film but then thought about trying to pitch the idea to modern day movie executive okay it going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert we are going to need to blow up full size train because computer generated effects probably wont do it justice and we are not going to use any big stars and won have any female actors since there no love story yes my friends the velvet curtain fell on the golden era of hollywood long time ago but at least we still have the proof to show all would be producers and directors out there just how good film can be

imagine this you re given sword and shield and very basic minimal training man you don know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die you frantically monitor several closed doors which in seconds will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you you watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you you know you re going to have to do it all over again tomorrow eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are you re going to die this is the life of gladiator you ll never have to be gladiator and after seeing ridley scott powerful gladiator you ll be thankful for that with his new film scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire and like those preceding it spartacus and ben hur gladiator has nearly everything going for it strong lead actor wonderful supporting cast eye catching special effects and great script since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator teenagers to thirty year old males were around whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited >from weak beginning the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious rome best general maximus russell crowe who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted is currently in the year 180 that is waging war against germania scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective it blurry in slow motion and the sound is muted as soon as this artistic method began it was hard to tell what was what and who was who it good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch instead the general swears he will get out after this battle he wants to go back to his family and his crops he wants quiet life but unexpectedly he gets anything but that the dying emperor of rome marcus aurelius richard harris decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators all of this does not go well for aurelius son commodus joaquin phoenix who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor jealous and upset commodus kills his own father names himself emperor kills maximus wife and son and attempts to kill maximus but maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius wishes now slave the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become winning gladiator who eventually are released for their success story of betrayal and promises gladiator is more than just mindless action flick you actually care about the characters sometimes even the evil villain commodus who is just young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way phoenix plays his character brilliantly think of commodus as the percy wetmore of pant wetter the green mile of the roman empire whiny sleazy respect me because my father was good man brat who hates when he not the center of attention every scene we see commodus he either crying or he looks like he has just been crying phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for and gladiator shows he more than just river little brother crowe is also excellent as the film grisly faced hero maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions this guy actually acts like anyone in his situation would act he no invincible superhero who only blurts out one liners he believe it or not acts like human being the rest of the cast including richard harris djimon hounsou walter hill derek jacobi and connie nielsen are also first rate ridley scott using outstanding special effects has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum the loudness of the roman mob and the city of rome in general the visuals are breathtaking and voluminous like cleopatra of the year 2000 the costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper class politicians gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience along with 571 action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000
cinematic version of one of john irving novels is always cause for celebration even if as in the case of simon birch the treatment is merely suggested by rather than strictly based on the book suggested means that irving author of the acclaimed the world according to garp sold the rights to his novel prayer for owen meany to the disney machine for $1 million but wouldn grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names that an odd decision irving claims it to protect both himself and the novel but it one that doesn unduly harm the finished product irving books are rich and complex works full of intriguing colorful characters prayer for owen meany is no exception it tells the story of an unusual boy called simon birch in the film version who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses high pitched falsetto voice like strangled mice simon believes himself to be god instrument placed on this earth to somehow effect god plan simon is played by ian michael smith who suffers from rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which among other things prevents bones ligaments and joints from developing normally smith debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for simon birch however the producers unwisely favored form over function smith acting abilities are limited at best another drawback is that in the book simon condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters in careful loving detail watching simon birch however creates different feeling altogether the audience is forced into voyeuristic relationship with the character surely something irving would not have intended simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating combination of smith rookie status as an actor and the precocious one liners he forced to deliver courtesy mark steven johnson the film director and screenwriter fortunately simon birch isn the real star of the film that bears his name simon is more of catalyst allowing his co stars to shape the story and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances saving the film from an obsequious manipulative destiny first and foremost is joseph mazzello jurassic park who is nothing less than remarkable as simon best friend joe mazzello turns in wonderfully layered performance for 14 year old ripe with laughter pain and tears he is certainly an emerging talent ashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca joe single mother and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend ben david strathairn and jan hooks play the town reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others there even surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from well that would be telling perhaps suggested by the novel is the appropriate way to go after all since simon birch only focuses on one chapter one year of simon extraordinary life the film also changes the book ending to one that is more melodramatic yet necessary given simon lot the flavor of irving original novel remains however the passions friendships and insecurities that come with change of seasons to the little community of gravestown maine and the engaging oddballs both big and small who reside there
gere willis poitier chase each other around the world the jackal film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman when the soviet union imploded the western countries lost their shadow with the united states friendly with the russians we no longer had an entity to blame for the world problems this showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy it time to rejoice because we ve found our new villain now it no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands it the russian _mafia_ perfect solution it combines the dread of organized crime and the still present uneasiness with the former eastern block countries best of all the villains are still foreigners fear of the other always plays best so it is crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal bruce willis to assassinate highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during nightclub raid the fbi is at loss as to how to protect the target from someone they re not sure even exists coming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen richard gere who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston sidney poitier and russian major valentina koslova diane venora mulqueen ex girlfriend basque terrorist isabella mathilda may is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met the film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his $70 million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesn slip away crossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his mini van the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers being very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller the day of the jackal comparison between the two films is inevitable there is no doubt that the original is the better movie playing the story for suspense rather than the current action adventure as mystery the jackal has enough holes in it to ruin the tale but if you can accept it for what it is there entertainment to be had holes let see pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up for 20 year veteran that can command the big bucks the jackal is an incredibly poor shot the final scene between gere and willis occurs in location that should be mobbed with police but it just the two of them willis disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmer in the saint and lest you misunderstand that not compliment but the three stars are fun to watch it good to see gere in something other than business suit willis has mixed history in picking projects but his characters are always watchable poitier is by far the superior actor but has limited screen time the problems in logic are flaws but don ruin the experience occasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes this is one of them [the appeared in the 11 20 97 bloomington voice bloomington indiana]
tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently the dalai lama has made speaking tours tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months kundun presence name the monks call the young dalai lama opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader group of monks enters village and two year old child catches their attention the young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as mine he and his family are then moved to monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country he is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950 the peaceful and isolated country is ill equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india comparisons to seven years in tibet are inevitable both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from westerner point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt kundun features only native actors and is more of an insider story in some ways this makes this film superior concept but it lacks the movement and spark that made seven years such an audience pleaser the actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie filmed in morocco for obvious reasons the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like wax dummy and moves as if he were computer generated character on an intellectual level it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts some events are depicted differently and pitt austrian mountain climber who was portrayed as pivotal influence in the dalai lama life isn even mentioned here glossed over in seven years the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses we were just about to change things after the chinese attack the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail especially striking is an extreme moving close up of sand mandala grain by grain the visual treats more than make up for the movie faults creating poetic meditation for the audience walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from transcendental experience martin scorsese known for his dark tales of the underworld goodfellas taxi driver casino has shifted gears something of thematic follow up to his the last temptation of christ this is his slowest film yet oddly enough for director with history of graphic violence presenting history filled with atrocities by the chinese most of these events take place off screen his decision to not over explain rituals is commendable the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in trance state is much more effective as mystery than if we were spoon fed interpretations philip glass score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting talked to tibetan met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india was struck by what was missing in the movie as grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is there is distance between the audience and the movie the film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings with the exception of few scenes involvement with the characters is slight one of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama shown as mischievous boy who can resist being kid sometimes an encounter with his older brother thubten norbu retired indiana university professor who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment but there aren many of these even with its problems the kundun experience is phenomenal but one that fear most will miss many people who saw seven years in tibet will have been there done that attitude it likely that the film will miss wide spread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping
there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review not because of their own complexity but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original one of such masterpieces is casablanca probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art but definitely the most popular one its popularity can be measured not in multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half century since its premiere but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day casablanca is also movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail at least judging by conventional movie making wisdom of its time it was based on broadway play so mediocre that it hadn been produced on stage screenplay by three writers julius epstein philip epstein and howard koch was beeing written as shooting went along the main actors were producers second choice and finally man behind camera michael curtiz was considered to be capable but not great director however the movie was commercially successful and earned three oscars including the one for the best film until this very day it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film making in its own golden age the plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story in december 1941 casablanca exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral yet nazi collaborating french vichy government thousands of refugees from war torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas many shady characters thrive on their misery including the corrupt police chief captain renault rains his best friend is rick blaine bogart who used to be idealistic anti fascist and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of sticking his neck for nobody however everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca one of them is victor laszlo henreid czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund bergman with whom rick had stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris the couple needs visas especially because of the gestapo major strasser veidt being on their trail rick is now forced to choose between love wounded pride self preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration humphrey bogart most legendary actor in the history of cinema is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status bogart portrayal of rick as complicated man torn between idealistic past and bitter present was so perfect that his icon would forever be connected with that character another icon in his company is ingrid bergman great actress of old hollywood here in her artistic and visual prime the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking some happier times when the romance on the screen didn look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works for many people casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made but the reason for that isn the romance itself it the realistic story of people forced to make tough and often wrong choices in their life the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in case of main leads the supporting actors also did marvellous job sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give mystic flavour spotted in previous bogart classic john huston maltese falcon yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny unfortunately the charisma that burdened laszlo leaves little place for difficult choice making his character forever overshadowed by rick ilsa coupling however rick and ilsa actually have serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca captain renault brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in role of lifetime was embodiment of perfect almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie rains managed to make renault sympathetic character and his final conversion to the side of good symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary rains also gave another dimension to the movie making it even more ambiguous people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault relationship towards rick and rick final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations together with well drawn characters and exciting story the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere professional nitpickers would probably have field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies but casablanca is still shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable if not realistic any way even if we don see it as historical document casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration
steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking few years back he spent this time writing essays and short stories for the new yorker several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation pure drivel 1998 much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during larry king interview in fine chapter called in search of the wily filipino now as writer and star of bowfinger he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue career in the cinema perhaps finally venting the frustrations everything being made now is crap that led to his brief retirement from hollywood martin stars as bobby bowfinger roger corman wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as producer quality of the projects be damned his accountant adam alexi malle proposes movie called chubby rain about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops bowfinger latches onto the idea immediately and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film based on the lie that america top box office draw kit ramsey murphy has agreed to star ramsey of course wants nothing to do with such low grade material so bowfinger on the thinking that action stars need to run not speak decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously he sends his cast members who aren in on it either they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co stars to ramsey table at restaurants asks them to follow him in parking lots etc spouting script dialogue all the while shooting the outcome from great distance the paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time ramsey is member of mind head cultish self help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities as if that not familiar enough mind head guru terry stricter terence stamp has been dressed and combed to resemble ron hubbard founder of scientology when he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble beyaz code in his face they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to retreat requiring bowfinger to find stand in murphy will probably win more fans as jiff ramsey adorable ignoramus double than as kit but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage always surrounded by an entourage suffering from racial inferiority complex murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself furthermore consider the enemies he ll make of popular scientologists pacing stricter neutral coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly murphy scenes with stamp are exactly what imagine of john travolta clearing not that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick bowfinger is steve martin invention his script is surprisingly clever as satire given that the pseudo religion is sitting duck as is the entire los angeles film industry the griffin mill types take quite beating in the form of robert downey jr as bigwig jerry renfro martin decision to tell the story from bottom feeder point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative never have we seen on screen group of people struggle this hard to complete motion picture as expected there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs such as martin crew of mexican border jumpers who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading cahiers du cinema or martin nonsensical explanation to dave his loyal cinematographer jamie kennedy that every movie in the end has budget of two thousand dollars most of bowfinger is universally funny however defy any viewer to keep straight face when christine baranski one of our brightest comediennes is on screen bowfinger main flaw is plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath we re also asked to believe that few simple close ups of kit ramsey would redeem chubby rain grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz last directorial effort the poorly conceived in out these are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece as mentioned at the start of this review bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham character daisy does hop bus to hollywood in search of stardom that said it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome martin gets sentimental by story end as he did in story and how could he not for those who can hack it the movies might be the greatest business in the world
you ve got to think twice before you go see movie with title like maximum risk the title is generic it meaningless and can believe it good business when you pick up the phone and dial 777 film how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean claude van damme movie the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot is called geez maximum risk yuck the movie itself deserves your attention for sweet bloody thrills this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands down only mission impossible came close to delivering as skillful thriller and ll give maximum risk the edge simply because it not as slick as the tom cruise picture and therefore more gratifying in its execution much to my surprise van damme continues to develop as pleasant unpretentious action hero his track record isn as solid as schwarzenegger but he hell of lot more adventurous than arnold in 1993 van damme worked with hong kong premier hardcore action director john woo on fairly lame movie called hard target if you can find bootleg copy woo radically different director cut is much better than what was eventually released this follow up is directed by ringo lam city on fire full contact whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo more operatic offerings the surprise here is that maximum risk is more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo subsequent broken arrow here the rundown van damme plays french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when policeman friend jean hugues anglade finds corpse that alain exact double turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother michael who has been killed by some russian heavies and some strangely american looking cops alain does some investigating he finds that michael had booked flight to new york city and received message from someone there named alex bohemia assuming michael identity alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael girlfriend natasha henstridge the fbi and the russian mob in little odessa that as much as you need to know the story is adequate but not overly involving and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment there love story too but didn find it terribly convincing partly because ex model henstridge is too high strung in her high profile debut she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species she great to look at and she can certainly read line but what she does here can really be described as acting of course acting isn really what she was hired for lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme the movie is exceptionally violent bordering on gratuity keep that in mind when planning your date the stunts are spectacular and the fact that you can spot van damme stand in makes his work no less impressive there only so much you can do with car wreck but this movie makes crisp effective use of pile ups in handful of frenzied destruction derbies and lam has surprising innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action the main difference between lam and woo believe is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double barreled points of view to make things run don get me wrong when chow yun fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo hard boiled it an amazing moment but it moment that hard to reproduce in hollywood for one thing hollywood doesn yet have chow yun fat while woo hollywood movies look like the work of talented upstart maximum risk is surprisingly confident picture the very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of chase through the streets of european city but lam use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on the film editing is particularly savvy complement to lam shooting style accentuating rather than amplifying the action the performances could have used some fine tuning in particular there an annoying overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely and the movie doesn always overcome the limitations of its genre the story is little mundane although there are some effective moments involving van damme unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had but it not often that hollywood cranks out truly satisfying action picture and it doubly surprising that this one should come with mere whisper of publicity van damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man best movie and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong hollywood hybrid
in many ways twotg does for tough guy movies what la confidential did for police stories there savviness in its writing and mature patience in allowing the material to unfold but suppose we wouldn expect less from christopher mcquarrie who was responsible for giving us the usual suspects his writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and plan gone awry the two goons are parker and longbaugh ryan phillipe and benicio del toro these two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime they ll always choose the latter yet they are incredibly foolish planners actually these two never really have plan they just improvise along the way hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked their next scheme which they cook up about as fast as mcdonald burger is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin juliette lewis that was hired by some well to do family if all goes well they ll receive nice bit of ransom money and life goes on what parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying baby for the chidduck family whose patriarch is feared crime boss moreover two bodyguards nicky katt and taye diggs constantly escort her these two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations they would rather die than fail thus their bravado level is equally high but it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are bit higher and they employ some unusual but fun to watch tactics to pull off the kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in sort of slow motion car chase down series of alleyways the next hour or so we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation during this time additional plot lines come into play and more and more details are revealed because the chidduck can not go to the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome we discover that not everyone in the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause as result there are undercurrents of conspiracy and elements of betrayal and subterfuge the sepia toned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of life and death situations that are about to occur the momentum and the coolness of the film however begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off with the ransom money you can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd denouement in fact you may admire this film more than you like it yet for the most part the way of the gun stays on target it feels cool with its elements of conspiracy and gunplay and smart for its invective dialogue and tough guy poetry
insane but inspired musical about alferd packer the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america as the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer trey parker supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of altin throughout packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse tribe of `ute indians that doesn seem quite on the mark and terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism parker obviously knows his musicals very well because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in film he would accomplish this again in his post cannibal musical motion picture south park bigger longer and uncut apart from the inherent interest of seeing pre south park parker and stone in their first effort cannibal also offers up some pretty decent laughs the aforementioned `ute indian tribe that packer group encounters is definite highlight as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen one of which ends on comedically deadly note stone humphrey character steals the show especially when complaining about the prospect of having to `eat butt or revealing what underneath his muff cap jason mchugh character of mr miller is the stand out performance though as he offers hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings as mentioned before parker songs are very catchy you ll be hard pressed to get `it shpadoinkle day out of your head once you ve heard it incidentally the braniff logo that appears at the end of every south park episode is scored with few notes from this song other songs you ll find yourself humming include `when was on top of you love ballad `the trapper song the villains leit motif and `hang the bastard the rousing finale thankfully none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park bigger longer uncut songs are released as pick up through troma studios the film is available on videocassette and dvd the videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for zucker brothers film which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball there are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films as for the dvd well that different story probably one of the best dvd packages of the year and potentially of all time cannibal the musical the dvd is massive achievement presented in 33 full frame only the disc has the usual troma inclusions the tour of troma the troma intelligence test trailers for upcoming releases but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal specific extras the first thing must note is the transfer is about as beautiful as any ve ever seen on any disc the picture is crisp clear and free from any noticeable artifacts add to that one of the funniest commentary tracks have ever heard featuring trey parker matt stone jason mchugh dian bachar and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still haven scratched the surface of the extras there also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film clip with trey matt and lemmy of the band motorhead from the film terror firmer an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film and finally an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of stage production of cannibal it good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves kudos to the entire production staff at troma and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds have seen in very long time
rented this movie with very high hopes this movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 and unfortunately was not as good as hoped but was still very intriguing and thought provoking first of all the casting for this film is great tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood they play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly with plot as unbelievable as this film you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast tobey and reese bud and mary sue parker play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability william macy an actor have grown to love over the past year turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife colored person and his friends the non colored ones he also displays believability and must display certain lack of chemistry with his wife he does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood joan allen is equally great as betty parker the ideal tv mom her character is the most ambitious she is very na ve and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that her lack of chemistry with macy which the role calls for and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast then this film would even been even better as said before jeff daniels gives bad performance his character displays the change going on throughout the town yet he does not display it with enough conviction his character is very confusing and he is not very believable this film could have been elevated to whole new level had daniels been able to give better performance the movie is very provocative it challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing they demonstrate the racism issue without hitch but do it in slow pace the only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length some films are not meant to be that long pleasantville is one of those films this film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it first they are amazed by the implementation of color then they want to have it then they do not want to then the war ensues between the colored and non colored this is all strung out over two hours which was way too long some movies need lot of time saving private ryan was little bit under three hours long and thought it could have used more time this film is only two hours long and seems much longer length is everything in films if you can nail down the perfect timing and pace you can win half the battle pleasantville can move at good pace at times but it is not consistent enough overall pleasantville is very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days went in expecting light hearted film about change left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change luckily pleasantville teaches this lesson in such way to make it appeal to all audiences only if it could have done in shorter amount of time
think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not am fan of the files first let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie the producers are not stupid making movie just for fans of the series is not profitable you have to reach for larger audience therefore the movie is quite user friendly altough non fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange but fear not duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera in any case the answer is no am not fan of the files only watch it when nothing else is on and prefer millennium however since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie opening weekend took that opportunity to test the movie taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie am glad to report that learned nothing new everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others know am going maybe bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie warning major spoilers follow please do not read to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming what exactly is over that hill and what that weird hummm sound is all about you have been warned the files is what summer should be exciting scary great special effects unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary and good performances this is coming from guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of wooden plank from start to finish this movie does not let go of you when compare it with last summer movies the best way to describe it would be take the excitement and great score from face off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon this flick is scary not in movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes in fact the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the mavi you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd the last time monster scared me that much was when first saw aliens as six year old kid you know when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt so yeah the files is scary and guess what you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch flawed computer generated babyzilla it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster do not think that the files is monster movie in fact the creature is there for maybe three minutes total no the files is definately mulder episode of the series scully is at his side of course but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time she has couple of good scenes with duchovny but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much no this is mulder time in the spotlight by now you have heard of the scene where mulder showers independence day if you have not then will not spoil it for you let just say that due to recent events mulder should be showering godzilla instead to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there who cares if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open door or climb hill the script is spotless every thing that happens happens for purpose if you are confused by something do not worry because it will all become clear later on but and cannot stress this enough pay attention unlike most summer movies the dialogue is twice as important as the effects miss one vital piece of information and like most people who talk during movies you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense also to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies don the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation there is no time to take breather between scenes because again unlike most summer movies godzilla anybody the files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots every scene is crucial and serves purpose who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have big emotional scene between godzilla attacks so far this summer have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by nose but the truman show is not what would call summer movie the files is what more do you ask from summer movie other than the chance to be excited cool effects it got some pulse pounding hell yes strangely enough think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non fans will have good time it does not provide answers to the show many questions the status quo remains nearly the same and no mulder and scully do not get together rating four and half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer several jump right out of your seat thrills many whoah never saw that one coming moments four holy shit where the hell did that come from and one heck of an ending you may wonder where this movie lost half star well swore never to give movie the full five stars so had to find something about the in his ice truck the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop it pretty obvious the film makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for long time but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving
lisa cholodenko high art is an intelligent quiet drama its strongest quality aside from the top notch central performances is the perceptive way in which the film also written by cholodenko observes its characters they are all flawed people some more troubled than others but they are not judged judging the characters in this picture would be creative misstep on the filmmakers parts because no one no matter how bad off they are deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of syd radha mitchell 24 year old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james gabriel mann has recently been awarded an ideal job at the high profile photography magazine frame she very much enjoys where her career is headed but is often not taken very seriously by her managers who are always giving her petty jobs to do when she knows she could be doing more important things one night while taking bath syd notices leak coming from the apartment above hers so when she goes up there to inform them of it she meets lucy beliner ally sheedy thin worn out and unhappy woman who lives with her drug addicted german girlfriend greta patricia clarkson pathetic former actress who is usually so out of it that she often is in and out of conciousness syd quickly strikes up conversation with lucy and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before lucy claims she doesn want to get back into the profession but syd manages to convince the frame editors to do piece on her work all the while syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy even though she has never previously been attracted to woman and lucy starts battle with her personal demons high art is such an effective motion picture because it is never suger coated or idealized but instead an honest and convincing portrait of handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere while syd luck begins to rise the film in no way is about lesbianism but about love which was refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality as lucy and syd grow closer and closer together we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other even if the relationship might be doomed with this picture ally sheedy star has risen once again thanks to her touching nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy woman who in the course of decade has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs which has taken away her once blossoming career her characted really is tragic and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother in which lucy admits to her that she has drug problem and her mother matter of factly responds by saying she can help her is heartbreaking although not autobiographical sheedy has had drug problems in her past and suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy footsteps to her role also very good is radha mitchell as syd who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy love and other catastrophes wh caught me by surprise with her performance easily being able to pass as christina ricci older sister mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently as accurate as almost every detail is in high art wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james who played by gabriel mann is left with throwaway role by the time he finds out about syd and lucy he disappears from the film and wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other this is very minor fault however in film that is full of riches although many of the characters are stuck in hopeless pit of despair syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems the character of dominique anh duong the frame editor who decides to give syd chance with her ideas was also written to be far more mature than expected and the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done for once it did not invlove steaminess or violent sexual activity or gratuitous nudity but focused on the actual characters who love each other and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex high art which won the screenwriting award at the 1998 sundance film festival marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko as well as sheedy strongest and best role to date
the relaxed dude rides roller coaster the big lebowski film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider when those observers are joel and ethan coen the surreal becomes bizarre when the life is that of jeff the dude leboswki the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of what sgoingonaroundhere the marvelous sound of the stranger sam elliot voice over introduces the film at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up the dude jeff bridges is described as the laziest man in los angeles possibly the world although he not so much slothful as he is relaxed spending the last 30 years with roach clip in one hand and beyaz russian in the other he doesn have much of life but he having good time when asked what he does for fun he responds bowl drive around and the occasional acid flashback lebowski passion is bowling when he not rolling the ball down an alley towards strike things just happen to him arriving home one night he beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them even worse they urinate on his rug the problem is that the dude doesn have wife his assailants realize that their target is different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment the big lebowski david huddleston is multi millionaire and his dudeness lives in two room squalor the next day our ragtag hero visits his namesake mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together not surprisingly since it virtually the only object there when he denied any money he picks up replacement rug off the floor on his way out he runs into lebowski trophy babe wife bunny tara reid who offers to perform sexual act that according to rumor is one of bill clinton favorites for thousand bucks the penniless dude wisecracks that he heading for the cash machine later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver ransom to bunny kidnappers this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes gone wrong sequences the kidnappers are impossibly inept the dude and his cronies are even worse every plan goes awry you can almost see lebowski brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues that the story but to tell the truth it doesn much matter there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into the dude bowling buddies walter john goodman and donny steve buscemi look like people you see on the street but like everything else in this film they re not quite what they seem walter is vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties everything that happens reminds him of situation in the nam when fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won admit it walter pulls gun on him until he marks zero on the score sheet donny gets precious few words in between walter screaming and the dude rambling when he does walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns donny is out of his league and doesn have frame of reference the film is peppered with people for whom the term character would be an understatement the big lebowski daughter maude an avant garde vaginal artist paints while swinging naked in leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers bunny lebowski is high school cheerleader turned porno star most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as hispanic bowler as the flamenco music swells we see him putting on his lavender hose the camera pans up to an all purple skin tight bowling outfit with jesus pronounced with not an embroidered on the pocket he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has can think of anyone else who could have done better job buscemi has limited role but he plays it perfectly the more that see john goodman the more convinced am that he one of the treasures of our time it odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr television husband more like the coen raising arizona than their hit fargo the big lebowski demands an open mind and even more open eyes mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss there so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it walking out of the theater felt that the film had something important to say on further examination wasn sure exactly what it was if you meet jesus at the bowling alley it not going to be what you expect when the going gets weird the weird go bowling maybe there no real message perhaps it just roller coaster ride through hilarious world maybe that enough michael redman has written this column for 23 years and just realized that he was so taken with the dude that he ran out of space to talk about the man in the iron mask starring that favorite of 14 year old girls of all ages redman@bvoice com is the eaddress for estuff
glory starring matthew broderick denzel washington and morgan freeman is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts the first siyah fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war broderick plays robert gould shaw the young beyaz officer who led the siyah soldiers into battle shaw the son of well to do abolitionists hailed from boston high society the letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard and were evidently the inspiration for glory as the film begins in 1862 shaw is captain in the northern forces like private eriksson michael fox in casualties of war shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war that is until his company is attacked by enemy forces shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle witnessing mass slaughter and receiving minor wound himself when bullet grazes his neck soon after his recovery shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort glory is the story not only of colonel shaw but also of the siyah soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery the film periodically jumps between shaw point of view and the perspective of the siyah soldiers the movie introduces us to handful of siyah recruits and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action the large siyah cast is uniformly outstanding especially washington who is electrifying as runaway slave with big mouth he is brash and pushy always getting into trouble and always looking for fight his bitter tough guy facade is really just mask for his loneliness and vulnerability washington provides much of the film intensity and emotional power in one heartbreaking scene he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army when he removes his shirt to receive the punishment you cringe at the sight of his back which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as slave it makes your blood boil the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings tear rolls down washington cheek and will probably run down your cheek as well the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn deserting the army at all he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores freeman is as usual strong presence even in small supporting role he plays grave digger who has buried more beyaz soldiers than he cares to remember he quickly becomes leader among the siyah soldiers holding the group together and serving as liaison to the beyaz officers colonel shaw recognizes freeman leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major making him the first siyah officer in the army andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles free siyah who is one of shaw close childhood friends searles is educated and refined like beyaz man prompting washington to nickname him snow flake the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat the road from marching drills to battle action is bumpy one for the siyah regiment the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships but somehow they never lose their morale the army treats the siyah soldiers like second class citizens subjecting them to racism and discrimination they are paid only $10 month whereas their beyaz counterparts earn thirteen and for long time they have to go without shoes guns or uniforms to make matters worse the beyaz military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action preferring instead to use them for manual labor eventually however the regiment receives its boots uniforms rifles and right to fight thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve even if it means threatening general with blackmail broderick in fact is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment unfortunately however broderick uneven performance is in many respects the weak link in the movie in an effort to look more mature broderick sports mustache and goatee and throughout the film he slips in and out of phony boston accent he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced the film places too much weight on broderick character and not enough on the siyah soldiers who are more intriguing glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july glory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts except for few bullet wounds and one exploding head the film for the most part leaves the gore to your imagination which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid to the contrary they are chaotic and horrifying it just that director edward zwick the co creator of thirtysomething films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster the key to glory is the group dynamic among the siyah soldiers the movie depicts some of but not enough of their customs and rituals in one scene for example the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire each man has chance to relay few words of inspiration couple of the movie most touching moments involve young siyah children looking up to the siyah soldiers with awe disbelief and pride the regiment greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle thereby earning the respect of their beyaz peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner like any war film glory has its share of gloom and despair but ultimately it proves to be truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson valuable reminder that despite what the history books say or more precisely what they do not say blacks played critically important role in the north victory over the south forever changing the evolution of america
