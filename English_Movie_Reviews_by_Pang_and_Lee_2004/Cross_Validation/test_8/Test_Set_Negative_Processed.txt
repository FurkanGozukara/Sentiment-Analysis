capsule in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace there is lot of fighting and not whole lot of story otherwise john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films especially assault on precinct 13 that the new film comes off as his homage to himself to +4 john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes for writer and director of horror films supposedly an expert on horror it is very bad mistake to make ghosts of mars is called horror movie but it is more just drawn out fight between humans and surprisingly low powered alien menace in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars carpenter would have grounds to sue this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 the thing and prince of darkness it is in fact surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way but that still does not make for really good science fiction experience ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear which is good for the film budget it is never mentioned but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth normal again making it easier to film society has changed bit by that time but it has advanced surprisingly little apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control and from carpenter view women have really made mess of things society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct yes precinct has been replaced by somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony instead of having the criminal napolean wilson this film has the criminal desolation williams instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face well ghosts of mars because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner but they essentially behave as human savages in another lapse of imagination the story is told in flashback flashback within flashback and flashback within flashback within flashback ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of kirmizi yellow and siyah carpenter manages to give us powerful opening scene showing mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with heavy beat sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup the terror he creates looks little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss his idea of building suspense is having bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights within short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars kirmizi planet and ghosts of mars after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by rate ghosts of mars on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale following the movie showed my wife who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than did carpenter classic assault on precinct 13 her comment is that it was seeing the same film twice
movie like mortal kombat annihilation works and must be reviewed on multiple levels first there the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie but occasionaly almost as if making an ironic self depreciating remark the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery no no just kidding had you going there for moment didn in all seriousness however and to be fair to the movie it is necessary to provide two viewpoints that of movie watcher unfamiliar or only marginally familiar with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon and that of fan of the first movie and or fan of the games the first movie mortal kombat 1995 concerned itself with martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth and it billion inhabitants the mortals won and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth unfortunately shao khan was poor loser and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway ready to take over the planet as our heroes assumed fighting stance the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those like myself who are fans of the game even go so far as to say that many folks who didn know about the game probably enjoyed the movie the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself and they didn try to overachieve there were lot of really cool fight scenes with really cool accompanying music intersperesed with some distracting but ultimately non intrusive bits of fluff passing itself off as plot and as we know the movie was smashing success at the box office mortal kombat annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie shao khan has decided that he going to take over the earth anyways and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused being trite being silly and being just plain stupid one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought hey that last movie was such success that we can get more money and make real movie now too bad they didn simply stick with the formula from the first movie could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture but here are the high points the acting is truly bad sandra hess playing the sonya blade character is particularly execrable especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie in one of the worst pieces of mis casting think ve ever seen james remar plays raiden the god of thunder in the first movie christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke french actor playing japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics generally like it when actors are cast against type tim tiny lister jr being cast as the president of the in the fifth element for example and remar has always been one of my favorite utility actors but he so totally wrong for this part that he doesn even have the luxury of amused self awareness there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important but then never seen again there are number of completely meaningless story sidetracks including muddled scene where liu kang robin shou seeks out nightwolf litefoot has mystical hallucination and then wanders off with jade irina pantaeva for these reasons and many others can only give the movie unless you re huge fan of the games and or the first movie in that case the following critiques also apply sandra hess while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson who played sonya blade in the first movie is much more convincing as fighter wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts and puts together much more believable fight scene in the fights each of the characters does at least one thing they do in the game and often more sonya does her kiss of death jax does his earthquake liu kang does his animality and so on big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely there aren as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang more robust plot in between silly silly folks and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into mud wrestling match lame and so obviously sexist even politically incorrect for the most part noticed and remarked upon it the special effects are generally better except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their animalities motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games give this you ll probably like it but not nearly as much as you liked the first one
mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see great big gorilla his entrance however is grand one out from the trees he leaps gargantuan and imposing sporting hands big enough to crush volkswagen bug and pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have joe bellows at the poachers before him angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars during this scene turned to my friend and said wow that some ape joe is quite gorilla big digital gorilla he runs around the fields chasing cars and people he picks things up and stares at them pensively he breaks things on accident because he just too big to avoid clumsiness joe as special effect is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes as character he doesn quite register and the story he been put in is as limp as they come the words family entertainment have never been stamp of quality but might joe young is just silly special effects movie pretending to have heart the picture is remake of the 1949 film it mostly just about the big gorilla but strictly as formality the movie also has few human characters the main one is jill young poor charlize theron forced to waste her talent lover of gorillas as child she witnessed group of poachers murder her mother now she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife specifically she out to protect joe giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood soon zoologist gregg hara bill paxton discovers joe he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to big game hunter named strasser rade sherbedgia who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill mother so in an effort to save joe jill and gregg take the big gorilla to preserve where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers in addition the space is way too small for him after all he is really big gorilla and to add to the complications strasser shows up under benevolent pretext he tells jill that he has preserve big enough for joe and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill mother jill of course doesn recognize strasser even though he did kill her mother this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with special effects film the movie isn really offensive it has some competent actors few nifty sets and lot of scenes with big digitized gorilla but the story is really dumb there aren any characters and the film isn satisfying on any level beyond its visuals the movie also has bad dialogue if critic says that film has bad dialogue it only fair to quote some of it but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like joe isn happy and joe isn safe here we need to get joe out of here joe is way too big for that cage don know if these phrases are word for word but they re close as said the characters here are only present as formality they do little more than state the obvious of course joe is too big for that cage paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on script that provides characters for them sadly mighty joe young wastes them both there are few clever moments although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment and as said the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes it certainly not bad film for kids doubt joe will give them nightmares but adults in the audience aren likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla big gorilla is only interesting for little while after that something needs to be done with the big gorilla nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla
pseudo intellectual film about the pseudo intellectual world of art magazines high art is as wasted as its drug addled protagonists in the only notable part of the movie ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles not that lisa cholodenko script or direction makes you care much about either character living in world of heroin induced highs they float along until they fall in love with each other this uninviting picture full of pretentious minor characters has receptionist that reads dostoevski and woman in the restroom line who is certified genius having recently been awarded prestigious mcarthur grant 24 year old syd radha mitchell who has rather bland live in boyfriend was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine frame although the receptionist is impressed syd is mainly gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ally sheedy for her to do photos for frame lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her since lucy fancies her lucy lives with her current lover washed up german actress named greta played with frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson the two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope usually heroin this does not happen in single episode but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture syd who lives in the apartment below them joins in on the fun and becomes member of the zombie club lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs which apparently is funded by her mother lucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being pigeonholed and since her mother has money we can only assume that that how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses typical scene has the editors arguing about whether potential photographer work is transcendental or merely classical that no one has clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny your work has cultural currency that is important now is the artist speak that the frame manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine when the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd her idea of romantic line is want to get high with you in lucy world sex and drugs come hand in hand and the movie except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing shows drug usage as being hip and natural part of the art scene this vacuous picture throws in standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions in another movie it might have worked but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted high art runs 36 it is rated for explicit sex pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age
my giant is two movies for the price of one but neither is worth the cost of admission even if you get in free as lamely directed by michael lehmann the picture tries to be comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book without goliath david is just some punk throwing rocks languidly paced throughout the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer the omen meanders toward its sad ending since it rarely funny or convincingly dramatic what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains mystery other than few nice visuals there nothing to recommend the picture with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally to the original city slickers billy crystal has shown that he more than the world best oscar host he does however have propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year father day and this year my giant one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with project surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success or maybe he wants to be dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie somber tone the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day this one joke movie single idea is to place real life basketball player gheorghe muresan who stands seven and half feet tall into as many visually striking situations as possible sammy crystal an agent currently without clients is rescued after car accident by sweet romanian giant named max muresan after throwing out constant one liners either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car sammy decides to get serious seeing max as his meal ticket and although he doesn like it he willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like wrestling match with half dozen dwarfs the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever after series of missed opportunities the comedic part of the movie is over and it turns into cheap and maudlin disease movie we learn that max condition is terminal and he will soon die to be fair the movie does contain few good scenes all of which you can see in the trailers let hope billy gets himself pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie my giant runs too long even at just 37 it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up my son jeffrey and his friend matthew both gave the movie single star and had nothing good to say about it matthew pointed out that it is not as good as it could have been or should have been amen he went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was
movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good the bad and the despicable originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in 95 but wanted to re write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics we need to be warned about some truly awful films too this picture was so bad it inspired the description for my 10 rating see ratings chart below the only thing saving it from 10 rating is that being able to rent movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting porno so it does indeed have some plusses in fairness elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff and her ability to whine and irritate us even while nude was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone this character is not smart not interesting and deliberately far too annoying far too often like in 1998s bulworth when the movie was over didn care one little iota about the main character at least warren beatty tried to make statement with his dreary and overrated film though showgirls is too stupid to make statement some people claim that the story is based on the legendary all about eve of all things if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph mankiewicz was he be well he be good screenwriter instead this project may have sunk his career he wrote the ha ha script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed the same team who created good sex film in 1992 basic instinct struck out here with their occasional violence gratuitous rated sex scenes and numerous and quite unnecessary lesbian overtones the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as dancer after the supposed street smart young lady gets conned out of her suitcase by slack jawed yokel in the opening sequence she befriends tailor of the glamorous stage production at the stardust hotel nomi doesn take advantage of this contact to break into the big time of dirty dancing right away first she becomes lap dancer at scummy strip club she sells her hot little wares at the cheetah for short time turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience hey never said she wasn hot number maybe it that her body which gets her into the big time when the star of the stardust hotel crystal connors gina gershon stops into the strip club it certainly isn her brains or pleasant disposition crystal requests private lap dance for her boyfriend kyle maclachlan he also happens to be the pleasure seeking worm who runs the big show crystal gets nomi onto the stardust team and after an interminable amount of time nomi earns the role of crystal understudy the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she not whore that phrase we hear few different times and it completely ludicrous of course she is she sells her soul to make it big but in the end we re supposed to believe that she better person than that we re supposed to root for her no way she tramp and back stabber who deserved nothing least of all vindication in the ahem climax she is not good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is the sub plot with male dancer glenn plummer who claims to see talent in nomi is just gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked little bit more it sure ain character development plummer also appeared in speed in 94 in smaller yet better role this sub plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control kyle maclachlan must have been promised big pay day or his standards have dipped since appearing in mavi velvet that picture was weird but some critics claim it one of the best movies of the 80s now ol kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the 90s too his sleazy character is important to showgirls but we don learn anything about him he uses people to get what he wants but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie is he villain who cares ultimately this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit everyone must know by now about the soft core acts of copulation especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool what few reviewers take issue with is how mean spirited this movie is everyone either having sex exacting revenge or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge it just too hard to take especially for over two hours if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world why couldn verhoeven have also made point of highlighting the whispers grunts and other sounds during the dance numbers it hard to care about these people if we can even appreciate what they re capable of doing on stage berkley may have future in hollywood because she can dance and she has great body after all the world of porn is still an active dishonourable profession perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford oops they re bad actors too well at least they re not selfish and contemptable like good ol slutty nomi malone useless trivia ironically elizabeth berkley played virtuous and holier than thou jessie on the teeny bopper tv show saved by the bell before breaking onto the big screen
virus is the type of cliched vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it strangely enough on the same mid january weekend last year another film was released like this deep rising about an ugly monster on cruise liner prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989 leviathan 1989 deep star six and all four alien pictures virus in comparison is servicable thriller well made and produced but since it doesn include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on based on series of comic books virus concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat which becomes extremely damaged during violent typhoon after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking un lucky for them huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen once the team reaches the russian ship they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted after turning the power back on however there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself one survivor finally does turn up nadia joanna pacula who informs the suicidal and stern captain donald sutherland and one of the crew kit foster jamie lee curtis that mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out if virus sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies you re correct although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life the film itself doesn appear to have brain in its head the film sticks so close to the worn out conventions of the creature genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play in her second return to horror in the last year jamie lee curtis once again proves to be strong and resourceful heroine but that is about it although 1998 halloween h20 was also disappointment at least she was given few scenes to develop character unlike here donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films such as 1994 the puppet masters although just watched him in the superb 1978 sci fi classic invasion of the body snatchers where he was fabulous the last of the three top billers is william baldwin but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture since he has nothing to do basically virus is another one of those films where group of people walk around and investigate space ship ocean liner haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one by one it is not the worst of its type but it is far from one of the best and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this as long as some of them keep making money suspect the answer is never
don expect much from eddie murphy these days for the past four years the gods of cinema or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates have allowed him to make one bad movie after another such films as metro doctor dolittle holy man life and bowfinger have reduced once great comedic persona to living and breathing washed up hack performing as studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film nutty professor ii the klumps the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places sherman has just invented new youth drink that enables man or beast to become younger for short period of time janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for soul mate rather than excel at her career as university professor and for the most ridiculous reasons with love on his mind sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego buddy love from the first professor who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers with some convoluted mumbo jumbo about dna extraction sherman extracts the buddy love link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into handy dandy lab beaker but one night the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy then the klump family all played by eddie murphy step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex flabby breasts slew of fart and dick jokes and enough fat people jokes that lost count after the first thirty minutes and did mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster the movie finally dissolves into really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene pure and simple the klumps is failure its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process it more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade american pie have their names stamped to this trash hey guys quick note keep this movie off of your resumes the characterization of sherman family the klumps is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of siyah family have ever seen in cinema everyone member of the family is large person who wipes the bins clean at local buffet restaurant like pigs at trough the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts the father is gruff is fired from blue collar job is sexually inadequate and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct and you got the feeling that these crass people couldn act like this all the time the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic after while their conversations just become barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story its also damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such lame story line even the best effects can seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days now that think about it the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make people will be lined up around the block for it the studios will concoct the sequel for release in the summer of 2002 eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles but he ll play every character in the movie just can wait to see eddie murphy in love scene with himself
much ado about nothing ah how sweet the irony it accepted wisdom in some circles among english literature nuts mainly that whenever critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance he just doesn understand shakespeare you will hear them say the bard work is apparently beyond criticism what load of old cobblers if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh film of shakespeare comedy much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word it time to get life get monty python get woody allen get john waters whatever just get real taste of some clever witty risky comedy and banish this nonsense to where it belongs drama and tragedy was shakespeare strength to my sensibilities and no stick in the mud much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever no kidding this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours have ever spent in cinema in my 20 years of movie going the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend as this was our day out and hadn seen her in ages but boy does she owe me one won spend too much time on the plot basically we follow the trials and tribulations of two would be couples one young the other older there some dark treachery amongst all this but everyone is so awfully jolly that you hardly know it mind you there nothing wrong with the basic story good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound nothing wrong with most of the cast either branaugh emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers the problem is the script or more accurately shakespeare original text light comedy shouldn be complex yet wrapped in elizabethan english the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend for this alone it will be problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than good undemanding laugh the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves the actor once again miscast as jealous half brother or something but when dissected and understood what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold ho ho ho boy likes girl ho ho ho men are such klutzes ho ho ho she so awfully clumsy oh please there wit in here somewhere told call it pretentious something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay in the end it cringeworthy watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing very weird movie going experience comedy bah humbug
if there one thing just can stand it film that oozes with sentimentality here note to all film makers films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves swelling saddening music is not good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy and that the situation is hopeless alas my giant is film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that forgot as watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up what reminded me was that wasn choked up or even the slightest bit moved for that matter my giant is forced contrived and conspicuously un cute detest the word cute but ve chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create cute film here it takes premise that might have been interesting liked the preview and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience maybe it will work for some people it didn work for me billy crystal plays sam cayman an agent who at the beginning of the film is in romania he in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing film the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired get in car accident and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall his name is max gheorghe muresan and sam thinks he be great movie star because of his size subplots are as follows sam has son and wife kathleen quinlan and he never around for them so they move to chicago max is in love with woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money and so their various subplots can all be resolved sam is broke max is dying pass the kleenex my giant as comedy is only moderately funny it has its moments the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself in one great scene sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal of course his son doesn believe that he actually speaking to seagal and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is would quote the line like but it would probably lose its effect crystal is always entertaining and he has few good lines here some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely often however he countered by slew of jokes that aren funny and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes muresan is kind of fun to watch but he just can act very well quinlan on the other hand is great actress who needs to get role that shows off her talents she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff here the best thing she gets to do is fake romanian accent all of these disappointing ingredients create film that for much of its running time is simply mediocre as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion however director michael lehmann who did great job directing the underrated hudson hawk and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings sam multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed how about main character who has healthy relationship with his family later it turns out the entire story is supposed to be great big metaphor signifying sam reunion with his family and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is valiant thing but had few morality problems with it and apologize for being vague it icky it drips with gooey wannabe human emotions my giant could have been straightforward and funny family film more importantly it could have been moving on level far deeper than it is instead it complicated overlong and under engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears and since it left me feeling completely unmoved stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world
in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa the twilight murders another one from the series is dealing with the case of gordon kahl played by rod steiger old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend year in prison than pay taxes to the despised government after being released he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest when the marshals come to arrest him it turns out that kahl isn alone many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti government beliefs and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that that brings fbi on the scene and agent mayberly michael gross is supervising the manhunt however his efforts seem fruitless since kahl still has many supporters some of them even in the local law enforcement after betrayed 1988 thriller by costa gavras hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right wing extremism in the american northwest and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing when media hype brought right wingers back into spotlight until that time only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon unfortunately the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script sometimes like many american tv movies it creates drama where drama shouldn be on the other hand film is steadily directed by dick lowry and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl on the other hand michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible however film does deal with potentially thought provoking social and political issues so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldn be the total waste of time
about an hour or so into the jackal character wandered around as people were being shot at in big suspense sequence and one of the audience members in the theatre saw it in shouted out hope she gets killed now at that point it hit me didn care for any of the characters being played by actors didn really like when the sole reason you care about character being played by sidney poitier in suspense film is because he being played by sidney poitier you know something rotten in the state of denmark every year couple films like this are released you know the cheap action packed international espionnage film featuring semi promising premise some big name actors usually bruce willis and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago this was the third one of 97 following the very lackluster the saint which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe and the surprisingly fun the peacemaker featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain the jackal tries to mix both elements and you thought the saint was bad the jackal is loosely very loosely hope based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that ve yet to see the day of the jackal which featured apparently suave hitman called the jackal played by edward fox trying to assasinate charles degaule well welcome to the 90s where sorta suave hitman also called the jackal bruce willis trying to kill the head of the fbi or is he after being hired by russian mob lord as bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother killed in the opening scenes the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere from helsinki to virginia setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he ll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion and like the saint the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people the agent working on the case cater preston sidney poitier yes that sidney poitier working with russian agent valentina koslova diane venora lady capulet from romeo juliet gives up early on and meets with an ex ira man declan mulqueen richard gere putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of 97 who in massachusetts jail but who has apparently seen the jackal who has been eluding the law forever soon he out working with the two untrusting agents and trying to help them catch him there are numerous problems with the film and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put finger on the film is supposed to be big suspense thriller but save couple moments the film never achieves suspense or even sense of intrigue sure the big assasination attempt is bit cool looking and even slightly tense but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register the film never picks up enough to become thrilling experience or even an entertaining one it doesn help that the plot is designed to be complex but falls into so many problems like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances the script of the jackal is complete mess mostly because it can decide what it wants to focus on is this film about man trying to find redemption by catching nasty killer is it film about nasty amoral hitman who in everything for the money or is it combination of both the jackal aims for the latter but never focuses in on either character the connection between the two feels completely edited so much that in scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan you wonder how he recognized him so fast the worst part is the little past they try to give declan most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend isabella mathilda may given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then the supporting characters are worse sidney poitier is given completely unplayable role that of man who is just stern sometimes and other times more giving and likable what is poitier doing here he one of the best living actors does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this diane venora russian character is almost as bad with cigarette perpetually in her mouth and plastered on expressionless facade it not that anyone bad here it that they have nothing to do the plot is joke feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain there are several times where he in tight situation and makes things worse for himself the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in cheap thrill take scene where he being followed by some agents into parking garage he quickly sprays his car another color and adds solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it doesn killing someone attract more attention than it does distract and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in public place geez is there anything good here well couple things did like willis icy expressions he may not have been real suave or anything but some of his looks are worth chuckle richard gere has couple of good moments making his character as likable as he possibly could have and couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous completely inane but fun kinda way most notably sequence where he tests out new gun on an annoying gun builder jack siyah and bit where he seduces gay washington man which has its share of couple good jokes most particular kiss by willis but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go they re just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is the jackal director michael caton jones who directed the far superior rob roy has made film that is made very couple months one that is unentertaining unintriguing and pretty much cold but will nevertheless make money because hey the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro clancy kinda way every now and then the filmmakers get it right clear and present danger which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way but the jackal is an example of when they go completely wrong
dreamworks skg running time hours starring robert duvall tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year the second is the macho armageddon is actually dull affair elijah wood plays leo biederman who during astronomy class discovers that large asteroid is heading for earth tea leoni plays rather crap news reporter jenny lerner who soon discovers about this asteroid through very long winded and boring way and robert duvall plays the leader of space crew spurgeon tanner who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth also featuring is morgan freeman as the president and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny father and mother while many people will walk into the film expecting big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up as the trailers seem to promise the film is actually more of character study if very poor one the main problem is that there are too many characters in the film and not enough time to explore them all only the space crew are given any depth jenny lerner leo and the president are surprisingly 2d and we never get to know these characters and because couldn care for them didn really give crap if the asteroid killed them or not the script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple and never really makes any interesting statements mimi leder the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker 1996 again directs in ho hum style and never really gets any emotion out of scene which is shame the cast are seemingly on autopilot although tea leoni does gives rather good performance even if she acts bit too dorky for her own good she seems uncommonly stupid for journalist robert duvall is on autopilot with underwritten role he just seems to be in this film for the money elijah wood one of the best child actors working today is surprisingly average although his choice of roles lately haven exactly been brilliant flipper 1996 his role is also vastly underwritten morgan freeman again is utterly wasted with ridiculously underwritten role like duvall he just seems to be in the film for the money the supporting cast are all none making much of an impression ok so deep impact may have messed up character wise but surely the special effects are good well yes and no although the special effects should be impressive with massive tidal wave destroying new york the special effects look like well special effects sadly the waves looks like it been drawn on computer and doesn look too good at all surprising really when the effects are done by industrial light magic who did the effects for the lost world and twister in the end deep impact is wasted opportunity what could of been moving movie with good effects turns out to be dud in both characters and effects the hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect once again dreamworks has churned out another average movie let hope armageddon is bit better overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities
if snake eyes were dog you put it to sleep if it was couch you put it out on the sidewalk where it would sit for week if it were your child you be reading military school catalogs if it were ship no it wouldn be the titanic that would imply glamor and tragedy it would be the exxon valdez personal side note saw this movie on the road during houston business trip for whatever reason my hotel cable system wasn showing the astros braves game which featured randy johnson greg maddux matchup this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching perfectly good baseball game for free so the invective deserved as it is should be seen in that perspective snake eyes is supposed to be mystery movie and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater snake eyes is not good mystery movie but had some questions where the manager and how do get re admit pass if fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rent car can sue brian de palma is it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage oscar will someone please begging you give gary sinise role worthy of his talents and how exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer if you ve seen the trailer without seeing the movie consider yourself fortunate the trailer is work of sheer genius it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie the noteworthy steadicam work the exuberance of cage performance as thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman the essential elements of the marginal plot the expert craftsman who pieced together fairly good trailer out of snippets of wretched movie deserves praise and percentage of the gross is best trailer category at the oscars that far fetched after all but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie the trailer sets up what should have been promising plot detective ricky santoro cage must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay per view boxing match unfortunately there are multiple problems afoot the trailer gives away much too much of the story the shooter is killed instantly so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy the film secret is ho hum at best and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is without an interesting plot without interesting dialogue and without much of reason to care about the characters or the story snake eyes is failure on almost every possible level as much as hated this movie must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit de palma is maddeningly inconsistent he can on his day create amazingly well done movies the untouchables carlito way on off days he can be well just horrid the bonfire of the vanities raising cain snake eyes falls into the horrid category but there are couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film school degree of difficulty value the steadicam opening scene does good job of introducing the cage character and is virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor there is split screen chase scene that looks pretty good and it followed by god eye view of bank of hotel rooms that imaginitively done this is what called giving the devil his due but the technical skill doesn even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie placing plot holes to one side for moment snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps and perhaps the worst most overly drawn out ending in years snake eyes is criminal act an evil waste of time and talent cage sinise and yes even de palma deserve better the audience deserves better but no refund no re admit pass no free popcorn coupon can ever restore to us the time we ve spent or wash the awful images from our mind however we are left with one consolation that we were warned by the movie title because snake eyes is nothing more than roll of craps
jean claude van damme movies tend to be if nothing else lot of mindless fun his latest film knock off skips on the fun part leaving wildly incoherent exercise that is well simply mindless you can really blame van damme no one suspect has ever expected the muscles from brussels to contribute heartfelt performance brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray and even his sidekick co star saturday night live alumnus rob makin copies schneider does what expected of him although neither appear to want the role of straight man no the problem with the film is its direction the first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible and it goes downhill from there five hundred characters it seems are introduced within the first fifteen minutes van damme doesn land his first kick until after thirty too late for most action fans and by the time the hour mark has rolled around your jaw will be on your cup holder and you ll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars on this mess director hark tsui whose previous film was the van damme dennis rodman teamed double team films at such frenetic pace that it hard to know what going on who on whose side and what the point of all this is faster than you can yell fruit stand we re watching crazed rickshaw race with schneider being bounced along by an energetic van damme when schneider starts whacking van damme in the behind with four foot eel while enthusing move your beautiful big ass the movie takes an unprecedented turn to the bizarre every now and again knock off will deliver some truly ingenious directorial flourishes inventive camera shots and angles wild rides down gun silencers and from the tops of buildings to the sprawling street below revealing cut ins within the frame but they all happen too quickly and within such furious frame of reference that they re wasted if only hark could have slowed things down just for minute if you re interested in the plot you re better off reading capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from the on screen shenanigans jean claude van damme plays shady bluejeans manufacturer who uncovers russian mafia plot to terrorize the world with nanobombs hidden in cabbage patch knock offs maybe with paul sorvino more accurate summary would be jean claude van damme bums around hong kong failing to avoid large blatant coca cola product placements the fact that the film is staged during hong kong last days under british rule gets some lip service but doesn figure in at all perhaps knock off most intriguing credit is that ron and russell mael composed the frenzied music score some of you might remember the mael brothers as the 80s synth pop duo sparks their contributions here are as confused as the accompanying action kimono my house indeed like the cheap jeans and pumma sneakers manufactured in hong kong van damme latest is real phony
slight romantic comedy with feminist bent but one with no edge to it it turns out to be conventional film filled with the usual clich and stock characters of this genre though it well written and well acted fluff piece it still does not have too much to say that is surprising it made for the gentle art house set those who don want something too disturbing to think about it about critically successful writer husband alec pryce who is so self absorbed that he threatened by his department store floor walking model wife kate bouquet who wants to be writer she meets his crass publisher vanni corso walken another self absorbed man and predictable relationship occurs the fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet she now wants her own identity and her independence the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for tv movie the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax it set in london and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by wealthy american shopper vanni she later meets him as her hubby new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as publisher of quality and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel alec who is an obnoxious grouse someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book published which only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni the publisher is proud that he mamma boy who never married and is self made man who has earned millions he has recently acquired failing old london publishing house and plans to revitalize it as he proudly tells kate if my father could sell pizzas in harlem could sell culture in europe the only thing that couldn be sold is this stiff story and tired plot line the mystery to me is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy she soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soon to become beleaguered vanni when she writes second novel he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one as its story of ambition and lust winds down in whimper business affair was loosely based on the real life literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly in their celebrated 1950s love triangle
maybe this mission should have been scrubbed mission to mars film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman there world of difference between artists and technicians the artist has vision to create something new he may not do it well it might be sloppy but it something you ve never seen before good technician can make it look good but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else it going to be just xerox obviously successful films need both skills brian de palma is masterful technician he spent his career copying others most notably hitchcock he usually knows exactly what to do to make scene work but only because he has learned it by rote aside from rare flashes of originality his films are often soul dead in de palma latest he turns his attention to stanley kubrick to tell the truth enjoyed portions of this movie but liked it lot better over 30 years ago when it was called 2001 enjoyed it even more when it was titled close encounters nasa has set its sights for mars when the first crew meets with disaster rescue mission is sent to the kirmizi planet they don do so well either but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut gone rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe and it all so boring there are so many scenes that just don work it difficult to begin when the first crew is few feet away from raging massive upside down martian tornado which looks remarkably like sandworm from dune destroying everything in its path they just hang out watching error the most interesting character and that not saying much is killed off error the alien is laughable error the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable error there some nice eyecandy the face on mars which turns out to be giant metal thai buddha head looks cool three dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic but there so much more that feels as if we ve been there before from 2001 there the rotating space station the blinding beyaz room >from close encounters they solve sound puzzle and play it to the aliens the list goes on the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues even gary sinise and tim robbins can muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing no one seems to care about anything that happens you won either the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr pepper with 20 foot tall logo saves the day they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film
big house big director jan de bont of speed and twister fame big star catherine zeta jones hot of the heels of entrapment 10 and zorro big remake of the haunting and big special effects so what do they all amount to unfortunately for us big bore plot hotshot doctor brings three insomniacs to an old spooky mansion for controlled testing unbeknownst to the patients the good doctor is actually conducting his own cover project that has to do with the psychology of fear critique this movie just didn scare me one bit sure it creeped and spooked me out little here and there but on the whole it took waaaaay too long to get going provided very little meat in the plot went way past its own bedtime and basically relied on grunts the muttering of children voices and over the top special effects to scare us well this film didn do much for me and they might as well have called it the haunting of lily taylor since she basically the only character who had any real depth background or reason to be in the house in the first place don get me wrong catherine zeta was sweet window dressing despite my continued perception of her faint mustache see entrapment and owen wilson was good as the standard comic relief but come on people if you re going to have us sit through two hours in theater with these folks how bout giving them little more than one liners as dimension neeson was also wasted as the smart british guy it all too sad cause certainly the idea seemed like good one see the shining 10 for close to perfect example of creepy gone awry but the story was thin the conclusion was laughable be gone poof and the special effects well they sure were nice to look at but not for moment did one of them scare or even for split second have me believe that they were anything more than hollywood special gadgetry see it for zeta jones or if you like special effects and scary movies that take forever to get going and provide very little payback otherwise skip it and check out the original or the ultimate movie about spooky homes from the netherworld the shining little known facts about this film and its stars goofy actor owen wilson co scripted indie favorites rushmore 10 and bottle rocket with director wes anderson his brother luke wilson is also an actor who once dated drew barrymore for year or so brother andrew is also an actor singer lisa loeb is listed in the credits as having portrayed the character of olivia morice but personally did not notice her she is well known for her number one single stay missed you and goofy glasses the creaks and moans heard throughout the house were prerecorded and played during filming in order to get more natural expression of fear out of the actors catherine zeta jones is currently dating flabby ass actor michael sex is my life douglas she stands in 1998 actor michael rapaport pleaded guilty to the aggravated harassment of lily taylor he was ordered to stay away from her and undergo counseling for one year actor bruce dern who plays the throwaway role of the gatekeeper in this film was once nominated for an oscar for best supporting actor for his role in coming home director jan de bont was born in holland and began his lengthy career as cinematographer on films as die hard hunt for kirmizi october and basic instinct directed by another dutchman paul verhoeven actor todd field also played small but pivotal role in stanley kubrick last film eyes wide shut he was nick nightingale the pianist this film was originally titled the haunting of hill house
the animal is marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling it clunky and slow like watching an 18 wheeler trying to accelerate up hill there are certainly better things you can do with your time actually if you ve seen the trailer then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments the story centers on bland marvin rob schneider who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be real officer but he afflicted with loser itis dogs attack him neighbors torment him children bully him and his co workers ignore him truthfully with his bad haircut seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic little richard and giant poodles and his unenthusiastic demeanor we probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun this is actually bad because you can like character if you can develop sympathy for him we never do and it may be just as well that he drives off cliff and plummets to the canyon floor however marvin is found by an eccentric doctor michael caton who uses radical and experimental procedure to save him implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs as result marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on body swim with the speed of dolphin and can run as fast as cheetah imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation with his enhanced abilities he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him however the spirit of the film takes raunchy turn and instead marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic sexual urges goats beware he also chases cats urinates to mark his territory or growls at his enemies what he should ve done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich equally tenuous is its other running joke which involves one of his friends guy torry who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he siyah it reverse racism he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything this element doesn work the first time it mentioned and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence you don have to be as wise as an owl to realize that the animal is tame if there any reason to see this film it to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut remember her she was voted off in week 11 of the 13 week program survivor here she plays marvin sunny love interest while her role required very little actual acting she seemed very comfortable even when marvin licks the side of her face like lapping dog yuck with her adorable disposition radiant smile and playful innocence she could be meg ryan in the making it too bad that she in such mediocre offering
gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has change of heart by the film end and becomes believer in god instead of skeptic going through an amazing transformation by having christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes someone who can now beat the devil by his faith alone this is after two hours of throwing people out windows and shooting more people than your average serial killer nobody can save this bomb from it own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is positive religious type of film it just pile of dreck an ill conceived exploitive project pyrotechnical film end of days aims to be an apocalyptic thriller it features an idiotic script hack director and one dimensional star who is past his prime which makes this film dumber than dumb plus it not funny not campy or is it in the least bit entertaining it just dreary and unwatchable big budget slasher film arnold plays an alcoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stop satan occupying gabriel byrne body and possessing wall st bank account from destroying the world the film opens in vatican city roma 1979 where the pope is alerted by young visionary priest tomaso looking out at the night sky and seeing comet whiz by who proclaims after looking at his scrolls that the sign for the eye of god which reveals that child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satan baby the anti christ in the hour before the new century begins when satan will fuck her and open up the gates to hell on earth tomaso has some twenty years to find this woman and save her and the world from doom but some in the pope circle want to kill her if found even though the pope insists on having faith and letting her live as he lectures them even in the world darkest days doing evil doesn stop evil but brings on more evil we saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979 which seems to be the logical place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries the chosen woman is christine york robin it is now few days before the new year celebration for 2000 and arnold and his wise cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard wall street turd and when he is fired upon by renograde priest thomas aquinas arnold saves him and through ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot he nevertheless can speak and tells arnold an end of days is coming as prophesized in revelations but satan gets to him in his hospital room and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of the end of the world on his body it is now up to arnold to save the world and find the chosen woman he quickly finds christine and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues people jumping out of windows satan taking piss and dropping match to kill arnold partner as the piss explodes like gasoline satan being fired at resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain and sometimes nothing as if the director forgot which way he wants to have it there is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs including the subway churches and luxury buildings the only trouble with all these high budget action sequences was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value the story was so terrible and inaccurate that it did not have an iota of value or credibility mercifully the movie drags to final confrontation in times square trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000 why is the end of 1999 considered to be the devil number 666 well satan numeral is actually 999 which is upside down of 666 accordingly you just put in front of it and bingo you get 1999 with logic like that this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewer eyes and got away with such febrile explanation of the occult this film should become classic used by film schools in how not to make horror film highly recommend seeing it for that purpose

it probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre the matrix existenz would collide with the even more popular serial killer genre kiss the girls se7en the result should have been more interesting than the cell as the movie opens therapist catharine deane jennifer lopez treats catatonic boy colton james by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that never fully explained after months of therapy sessions in surreal desert catharine has no success to report meanwhile killer carl stargher vincent onofrio has claimed another victim his particular hobby is to kidnap young women keep them in glass cell overnight and drown them he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching video tape of the drowning although carl been doing this for awhile he recently become sloppy and fbi agent peter novak vince vaughn is closing in fast not fast enough though to keep carl from sticking another woman tara subkoff in the cell or to catch him before he suffers schizophrenic attack that leaves him in coma from the videos in carl house peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction to save the kidnapped girl peter has to find the cell before the end of the day and comatose carl not talking so off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl mind and find out where the cell is in time the focus of the cell in on the ornate interior of carl mind but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality for the most part it style without substance in his own mind carl is decadent emperor in flowing robes ming the merciless as well as frightened boy jake thomas abused by his father all in all the mind of psycho killer turns out to be strangely dull place and kept wishing could fast forward to the next development singh is best known for directing music videos particularly rem losing my religion and the cell seems very much like really long really slow mtv video with the sound deleted singer lopez seems to think she in video as well she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting the premise had great promise the computer generated world within carl mind could have been bizarre surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic the first room catharine enters in carl head shows this promise she finds horse standing in center of the room suddenly sheets of sharp edged glass fall into the horse dividing it into segments the panes of glass separate pulling apart the pieces of the still living horse this scene is twisted disturbing and thought provoking because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder another element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of psychopath their minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharine own psyche like sidney lumet the offence or michael mann manhunter the cell could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out repressed darkness in the investigator however catharine character is hardly developed at all and lopez has no depth to offer the role bottom line don get trapped in this one
plot rich guy who doesn believe in love orders mail order bride for himself that very evening the couple is married and fall madly in love soon thereafter but what this one of them might not be the person they are pretending to be wow sin indeed critique easily one of the worst movies that ve seen all year too long too boring too predictable and too ridiculous for anyone interested in watching good movie what the hell were they thinking when they made this thing it no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about year this felt like really bad tv movie of the week with some nudity stuffed in from time to time just to wake up the audience have you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies one that you just couldn help but switch back to from time to time just to make sure that it wasn part of some sick joke well this movie is exactly like that only it isn joke it isn on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it say again what the shite were they thinking okay so where do start first of all the trailer of this film gives away the movie main plot twist the betrayal so for the first half hour of the film you re basically just sitting there watching these two lovers go through the motions until the betrayal occurs whoopee big surprise second of all angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part why well it like this not for one second do you ever believe that she is not nasty backstabbing woman mean it like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining well the same goes here every look in jolie eyes screams psycho then of course you have the case of the patsy husband man who just can seem to figure out anything in time mean how boring is that for the audience you re watching this guy screw up time after time after time and somehow we re supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude no thanks and if we don care about him and we really don care about her she beeyatch and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film well ll tell you the only thing that was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled no suspense no chemistry between the leads no real love or passion no sense of surprise plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending so why am even giving this film rating of three points well it actually pretty simple liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of jolie boobies that two points right there and another one for antonio ass hairless just for the record everything else in this movie was pointless boring and just plain stupid try imagining soft porn movie but without the plot that pretty much what you ve got here low point in the careers of both stars oops almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue god oh mighty make it stop where joblo coming from american psycho 10 cruel intentions 10 eyes wide shut 10 fatal attraction 10 playing by heart 10 under suspicion 10 what lies beneath 10 what women want 10 whipped 10
according to popular film opinion film greatness is determined by time take for example casablanca great film even today it still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic another example would be star wars which had very very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about billion times before but as rewatched independence day when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 kinda felt like it wasn as cool as when had first seen it had liked it when saw it the first time was my original view and basically saw it as good escape film but when rewatched it felt cheated thus the curse of the event film independence day is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once except for couple kids the critics in this situation but after while this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one well this kid is the event film in my little analogy and when rewatched independence day not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen but felt insulted the whole time there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren sure if it comedy or hokey drama one scene you ll see hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch the next you ll see bunch of military uptight guys walking around saying corny lines the worst is scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of glen or glenda now this annoying kid problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once he shows he has no balls and independence day has no balls it plays it safe everywhere it throws in ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of star wars mean isn that devil den and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore breasts in striptease they re these octopus men boring freaking octopus men mean come on the aliens in 2001 were more interesting and you didn even see them basically the plot is straight from movie from the 50s aliens come to earth and we wonder if they re hostile or peaceful okay it an interesting topic but it not handled greatly now they aren and somehow computer geek jeff goldblum figure out they re using our satellites as countdown to destruction yep these aliens are not only heavily armed they re stupid too they also use the same kind of computer as we do but that comes about later the president bill pullman who under attack for being wimp decides this would be nice time to be belligerent and he decides he ll stay in the beyaz house which the aliens have covered don care if it bob freaking dole in the beyaz house get him out of there don care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol just get him out of there later on he stupid and wants to fly in the attack on big alien ship think it time for impeachment for this guy he more senile than reagan on pot then there cocky pilot will smith who is the only person to survive the counter attack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51 the film only sign of being brave his girlfriend stripper sharing subplot with striptease in that she has to do it for her son come on she has fighter pilot boyfriend soon to be fiance think she can quit that job and get more respectable job at long john silvers she also the few the proud the lucky to survive the igniting of as well as her dog who narrowly survives there are some bright spots they tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing the best one is when jeff goldblum nicely named david turns on his computer and picture of hal comes up and says good morning dave and they even played it the end of the world as we know it and feel fine at the beginning and judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great he stereotype but just loved the man anyway but there are no real subtle comic moments will gets way too many one liners and he has no one to play off of execept jeff towards the end and the two do great as said this film has no balls it is just aiming for crowd pleaser and that what it is but after couple months we all move on to the next event film while intaking little films and couple indy ones for good measure but at least the indy ones last for lifetime this one short on batteries
shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen it is both humorous and romantic in very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly and and half hours that it occupies that is however not to say it is good film quality production or anything of the sort shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work the finest sign of this may be the plot in looking back there seems to be little more than thin predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books philip henslowe geoffrey rush owns of the theatres in london it is at the peak of the royal theatre era and queen elizabeth the recently damed judi dench by appropriately enough queen elizabeth ii is very much fan however to directly quote the film he has cash flow problems through long set of events it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts so mr henslowe employs the young playwright william shakespeare joseph fiennes to pen comedic production however the young writer has severe case of writer block and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well he has the title in mind romeo and ethel the pirate daughter even that joke loses steam after while but can seem to put words to paper then as only hollywood could have it through long set of twisted events he meets viola de lesseps gwyneth paltrow and falls madly in love thus curing his writer block there are many other little issues that mr henslowe encounters but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing the first realization that reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that show should not always be credited to it author ironically that couldn be truer here the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner but rather young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love so it is that am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond character name in the credits the acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth theatres joseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though he is tragically unbelievable and comically bad gwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well however the supporting cast does almost save the day geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking they both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links you will also find very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting no armageddon doesn qualify as real acting and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well but not even they could save this sad excuse for film so it remains plagued by poor performances when all is said and done shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained however as the film so kindly pointed out entertainment may be fun but it isn necessarily quality and this certainly isn quality perhaps this may be best compared to john grisham novel as dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work simply put it is far fetched poorly crafted but very entertaining
there is scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been the scene is set in jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944 where one time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets fists stuffed into coat pockets to one side of him residents scavenge for food in the street to the other side german troops beat group of jews jakob however never stops moving it an efficient effective set up for the character who is clearly nobody idea of hero at the outset he is man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them excising his moral peripheral vision the set up is critical because fate will turn jakob into reluctant savior after visit to german commandant office and moment alone with turned on radio jakob learns that russian troops are quite near when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews they become convinced that he must have radio which is punishable offense in the ghetto the good news brings hope to the ghetto the everyday specter of suicide vanishes private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting the ordinary person in question jakob heym is played by robin williams am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his serious roles with every passing year compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams and see how much more mannered he has become or at the very least how much less sensible at choosing material jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions but williams always looks like he struggling _not_ to craft them when he improvises radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10 year old orphan lina hannah taylor gordon he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky oh yes and then there that little girl some viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero fanciful stories for young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful but those scenes aren problematic because they re familiar they re problematic because they re jarring and distracting introducing cutesy relationship into film that shouldn have been about cutesy relationships jakob character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others but there are plenty of others without poor little lina every scene with her feels contrived pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to previously hopeless people it is pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is much grittier production than you might expect from hollywood ized holocaust combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways director peter kassovitz working from jurek becker novel crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople and draws solid performances from armin mueller stahl as once revered doctor and bob balaban as barber drifting into depression there are just too many things going on that prove distracting whether it the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter or williams incongrous presence or sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl jakob the liar deals with too delicate subject for such fumbling and has too compelling central character to waste and after one wonderful early scene you can see the film wasted and fumbled away
an intimate character driven drama about troubled youth at crossroads in his life read the press notes for _reach_the_rock_ not really sure what film that statement is describing because those words bear little resemblance to the slow completely uninvolving bore saw at least it certainly does not describe what goes on for most of the film alessandro nivola plays robin fleming troubled directionless 21 year old who has penchant for breaking storefront windows in small town police sergeant phil quinn william sadler takes him in and what ensues for the first 70 minutes is tedious series of sneak outs and sneak ins where robin slips out of his jail cell breaks window then returns all without quinn ever noticing also added to the pointless proceedings is some would be humorous shenanigans involving quinn dimwitted deputy ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex with his girlfriend donna karen sillas with half hour if even that long remaining director william ryan and writer john hughes yes john hughes of 80s youth films and _home_alone_ finally approach something close to point turns out robin still pines for his high school sweetheart lise brooke langton who has long gone on with her life and hughes main concern at long last reveals itself as tired live in the present and for the future message most moviegoers however will likely be asleep by that time wide awake however is the cast who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy and skill thus revealing the _real_ purpose behind this listless enterprise to serve as series of acting exercises such glorified workshop may have its rewards for the actors but it leaves audiences with booby prize opens october 16
the spy game is up you can thank charlie angels the movie for that when did banality and pandering become okay just steal from hong kong the matrix and kitschy tv show from the mid 1970s and that movie charlie angels is one of the worst examples of action film homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film ve seen in ages charlie angels is dumb just plain dumb as we all know three of the hottest females on the planet drew barrymore cameron diaz and lucy liu are three super agents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie they all drive fast cars look oh so fabulous even in the morning and don seem to get scratch even when fighting armed men having buildings explode ten feet in front of them or flying through the air in matrix slow motion and while the entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavage busting wetsuits cleavage busting waitress uniforms and cleavage busting wet shirts they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as group of annoying drunk sorority girls the kind who hit on everybody at party the actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of millionaire computer engineer the great sam rockwell who gets kidnapped by mysterious rival computer company of course the rival wants control of his new personal identification system which involves such latter day buzzwords as gps cellular tracking and even mainframe the amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to the angels like battling each of them in many round robin matrix rip off again fight sequences and harboring strange attraction to sliced off locks of the angels hair the coup de grace is bill murray as bosley serving as charlie manservant or more to the point the angels pimp the rest of the movie comprises revenge arc enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables carbon copy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to jackie chan and the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft and the strange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourke long lost brother charlie angels starts off with bang and ends up being soggy burrito left out overnight nothing is difficult plausible or believable in any of the angels actions it feels like the matrix mission impossible and cleopatra jones and the casino of altin all rolled into one diaz is knucklehead barrymore is the dangerous one mean and tough and about as believable as katie holmes in the role liu is just lucy liu looking good in skin tight siyah leather suit the list of movies from which charlie angels is directly lifted is equally astonishing the writers apparently ran the copier all night stealing scenes from armageddon lethal weapon ii all of jackie chan movies the great escape saturday night fever revenge of the nerds payback darkman dr no the matrix as mentioned and even tv friends it shame too because one of the many screenwriters john august was at the helm of last year favorite go then again what can you expect from director known solely as mcg there is no camp value in the film no interesting main characters no invigorating action scenes no reason at all to waste your time except to ogle the hot chicks and enjoy the performances of few supporting players note to hollywood next time let leave the tv shows on the tv
the tagline for this film is some houses are just born bad so didn expect too much from this but had preserved little spark of ope as entered the theatre thought liam neeson cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont thought mabe it will be fun and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing but by the end of it thought why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones jan de bont these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality here is the story in the monstrously over decorated mansion known as hill house visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor liam neeson into being guinea pigs in fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation among them is sophisticated bisexual cathrine zeta jones cynical dope owen wilson and gentle and emotional lady lily taylor actually the doctor is researching the primordial fear reaction and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens but he gets unexpected help from the house itself it rumbles hums and belches forth remarkable sights portals become veiny stained glass eyeballs fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like sinister mouth filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real placing an emotional wall between audience and screen the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture is that exciting or what the worst thing about it is that it didn have to be bad it based on great book ``the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience the blair witch project that cost less than an old car managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses and with $70 mill budget de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of perfectly lovely piece of terror de bont has style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is in itself frightening he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush but why give him more serious material in the end haunting will only haunt its fledgling studio dream works skg and de bont career as director yet it wouldn be fair to say that everything is bad the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated beautiful mysterious magical and spooky but this is where the good things end the music is blaring the floors moving the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming and all of this every second every moment of screen time is absolutely without life it nothing more than special effects extravaganza visually impressive but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn engage at first you do not know what going on is this part of the experiment are these hallucinations projections of the subconscience paranoia but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening the house is actually possessed it is at that point when all your hopes for good entertainment disappears out of the window for ever sat in anticipation for decent climax and that what got believe hichock once said that it better to wait for climax than to see one this may be true and it might actually work but there is only one problem jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary only stupid they are impossible to take seriously any paralells that you might have heard before linking this picture to kubrick the shining are absolutely baseless shining had class style story acting but most of all talent and originality haunting has only special effects and art direction to boast of and those elements alone are not enough to make it good film casting good actors for small pale parts only makes things worse but guess that no matter what or other critics say or write most of you will see this film anyway even if the tagline would say some films are just born stupid
tv buffy finds herself on the other side of the supernatural spectrum in simply irresistible sarah michelle gellar that never ceasing crusader against never ending evil every tuesday night on the wb network here plays down on her luck chef suspected of dabbling in witchcraft after her flailing restaurant receives help in the form of magically scrumptious meals taste test results some vampire slaying though out of place would have really livened this excruciating movie up simply irresistible is actually quite easy to deny disaster of culinary and other proportions pretty much from the opening on gellar amanda finds herself falling for harried henri bendel exec tom sean patrick flannery of powder around the same time she discovers an uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking secret ingredient that arouses both his interest in her and the public in her tiny tribeca eatery all this love and sorcery have lot to do with the telekinetic crab that also figures into the story tale that at times plays like an american spin on 1993 mexican classic like water for chocolate several differences one like water didn have telekinetic crab and two like water was good film simply irresistible on the other hand is about as challenging as an easy bake oven amateurishly staged scenes cancel each other out in their badness from an embarrassing seduction in literal vanilla fog to an impromptu dance sequence where tom and amanda do their best fred and ginger though fred and ginger never took part in anything this garish the intrusive musical score distracts from the flat dialogue at regular intervals but it not like you re were going to miss much in fact take away the few instances of salty language and this has made for disney channel written all over it but majority of simply irresistible resistibility factor has less to do with the afore mentioned overkill than the bland leads tom and amanda are so thin and ambiguously defined that there just no fun rooting for their inevitable happily ever after nor do the otherworldly powers that serve to bring them together make sense so we re left with ho hum relationship based on enchanted eclairs it not going to last long people perhaps sensing this the filmmakers have piled on weird supporting characters for acting vets like betty buckley dylan baker and patricia clarkson but they don go anywhere either in fact nothing in simply irresistible goes anywhere save for gellar and she doesn go somewhere so much as you wish she go _somewhere_ like to better movie already proving major talent with relatively few big and small screen roles she the sole reason this overcooked souffle isn completely fit for the garbage disposal looking smashing in her todd oldham designed duds and investing much more in her perfunctory part than she ever gets in return it certainly dish best not served in it current condition but one can only guess that without gellar simply irresistible would be strictly unwatchable
the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of traveler as anywhere but here there isn one thing about this mother daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest it relies on contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives as for some reason they couldn figure it out for themselves if the film looks familiar that is because the slums of beverly hills 98 went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances in which they were fortunate to have much sharper script to work with alvin sargent script was weak and annoyingly claustral wayne wang the joy luck club inept direction made weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn convey pushy mother adele august susan sarandon forces her 14 year old daughter ann natalie portman to leave small midwestern burg to go cross country with her to beverly hills the daughter resents her twice divorced unstable but exotic schoolteacher mother bullying her to be an actress as means of escaping humdrum life the daqughter doesn even like the used altin mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio so it becomes question of who knows best as the ladies fight it out between them until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner adele dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn look that good as she lands job in slum school has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids and settles into job she hates in order to financially survive daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there during one of many arguments with her free spirited mom they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed she runs away only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop michael milhoan who offers her wise counsel with the cop zen wisdom passed onto the daughter she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla during their stay in beverly hills she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even high school rich boy admirer eliot corbin allred reader but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality as everything seemed staged and unemotional when she learns her cousin benny shawn hatosy who happens to be her best friend dies in traffic accident back in wisconsin she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasn clearly shown why she wants to stay there and for that matter it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams guess what the filmmaker is trying to say is that mom is bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one able to recognize mother faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself mother has series of setbacks like being dumped by her dream boat dentist bochner she met on the beach and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part but mother learns that her daughter has grown up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do this of course results in the corny ending showing that mom heart was always in the right place only she went about it in the wrong way this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing
capsule wild jungle woman and an 11 story gorilla are discovered in tibet and taken to hong kong where the gorilla escapes and causes havoc this is laughable 1977 rip off of king kong 1976 itself rip off production values are low and audiences seem to like the film mostly for derisive laughter high to +4 directed by ho meng hua this film is provided to be sort of laughing stock to finish the festival an earthquake uncovers an 11 story tall gorilla in the himalayas hunter chosen because he just broke up with his girl and is at loose ends gets sent to find the ape and finds sort of female tarzan who controls the ape evelyne kraft is the jungle girl in leather bikini that she is pasted into so she always looks on the verge of bouncing out of gorilla actor has no idea how gorillas move and suit is terrible nice miniature effects however has almost music video inside it of jungle girl playing with animals like chi chi the leopard several places there is narrative that is nearly incoherent as if there are missing scenes and the viewer has to guess what happened in the interim actual location shooting in mysore ape shown badly matted behind temple combining of images usually pretty bad incompetent matching of film stocks stock footage frequently used gorilla brought to hong kong by greedy entrepreneur who really abuses the ape before it escapes and tears things up real good
adam sandler vehicles are never anything special but continue to make load of money which really goes to show the sad state of cinema today while good comedies like rushmore to choose recent example gets limited release and doesn make lot of money big daddy got huge release and has made lot of cash it also nothing special and doesn deserve the money it making but digress sandler plays sonny koufax unemployed new yorker with seemingly low mental age his girlfriend makes ultimatum to him either wise up and get responsible or she leaving him by strange set of events koufax ends up with julian played by twins cole and dylan sprouse five year old kid after failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with the child koufax decides he wants to keep the child however social worker mr brooks mostel finds out that koufax isn the real father and wants to take julian back koufax along with his new girlfriend layla lauren adams fight to keep the child big daddy really isn that good many of the jokes revolve around toilet humour and supposedly we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against wall to be funny there the occasional good one liner but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour the film after all these silly gags then suddenly turns sentimental and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous the court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable and not helped by the soppy overacting it poor attempt to win over the audience adam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films except the wedding singer joey lauren adams is much much better and deserves far better film than this trash steve buscemi pops up in funny cameo and his scenes are pretty funny rob schneider is also funny as crazy delivery man the two twins who play julian are they start out rather well but then becoming annoying and brattish halfway through and finally turn all american wholesome goodness at the end of the film where the tear juice is turned up high big daddy is really nothing special and is not even worth it for few chuckles although it is actually well put together with nice direction good production design and even some montages this professionalism can help the fact that the script and characters are trash big daddy is for die hard fans of sandler and that about it
there scene early on in jawbreaker where character utters the unintentionally prophetic line that is so not funny how right she was this pathetic tale of three high schoolers who accidentally kill their best friend in birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry is never even remotely funny or fun or original not content with the too obvious heathers heisting the filmmakers proceed to lift freely from staggering variety of sources including carrie bride of frankenstein mavi velvet and even shaw pygmalion itself recently remade as she all that jawbreaker is pastiche and not even an enjoyable one find it extremely telling that the most engaging part of the film is the credit sequence jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by veruca salt volcano girls serving as blueprint for the rest of the film the song has absolutely nothing to do with the footage we re watching just close your eyes and pretend you re listening to an alt rock station you won be missing anything the blame for mess this big has to be spread around among the principals rebecca gayheart following roles in scream and urban legend should have known better than to take yet another role in yet another teen body count movie pam grier has totally wasted any credibility she might have gotten from her role in quentin tarantino jackie brown and rose mcgowan should just quit acting she has no charisma no presence and no acting skills other than rolling her eyes and looking disaffected mcgowan manages to be upstaged by her real life boyfriend rocker marilyn manson whose fifteen second role here is far more interesting than anything any of the real actors are doing manson sans trademark makeup contact lenses and with an obviously fake moustache looks eerily like nicholas cage who woulda thunk it that crack about direction by committee wasn merely pithy sound bite stylistically thematically narratively jawbreaker is all over the map varying wildly in tone content from scene to scene though credited solely to writer director darren stein one gets the feeling that no two scenes here were actually guided by the same hands if stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this atrocity someone needs to get the man some drugs pronto prozac lithium kava ritalin something anything he quite obviously in desperate need of chemical help jawbreaker is monumental waste of effort and resources and quite likely one of the single worst films ve ever seen to call jawbreaker garbage would be to insult garbage bad flicks for the rest of the year are safe ve already got my pick for worst film of 99 jawbreaker runs approximately 90 minutes though it feels longer than titanic and is rated for language sexual situations and graphic violence not recommended for kids teens or anyone else
want to be involved in show business one day and refuse to do any sequels to any movie may make because believe they only get worse this movie proves it for me was little worried about the last batman film as thought joel schumaccer taking over from tim burton would screw it up also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne they didn kilmer did good job and the cast was left to carry the movie which they did even jim carrey as the riddler and can stand jim carrey because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles this film is different the cast is still impressive but here not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction he one of those directors who good with actors terrible with camera angles but writer akiva goldsmith doesn really give an impressive cast anything to do the cast is impressive clooney is surprisingly good wayne batman donnell is crafty robin as usual they could ve casted somebody better as batgirl my friend likes neve campbell but silverstone is not bad and thurman is good poison ivy the major problem is schwarzenegger who is terrible freeze his accent is so heavy you can understand what he says and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act and they know it but they figure that if they flex their muscles say limited amount of stuff and kill bunch of guys then they figure nobody ll notice that the trouble with me notice schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney or as much money as he got for this but hollywood thinks he does patrick stewart was the person heard that was considered to play freeze and he would ve been so much better or sean connery but not arnold not an actor but play one in real life schwarzenegger realize that you must be star to play major role in batman film but it would ve been nice if they casted star that had talent for the role akiva goldsmith screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in normal batman film in regular batman film they concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend little more but elle macpherson julie madison is so limited here that we never get real sense of who she is there is talk of fifth batman movie my interest to see it is low but hope it better than this if you don want to waste your time rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster any other
surrounded by hype high hopes and the promise of an over the top performance by clueless brittany murphy don say word looked full of promise hell when hear that ll never tell whisper on the tv commercial goose bumps run up my spine alas word is filled with little but disappointment kooky mix of girl interrupted and ransom with michael douglas and company collecting paycheck to plod through vapid and dull kidnapping thriller douglas stars as nathan conrad renowned new york psychologist devoted father of jessie conrad skye mccole bartusiak and loving husband to aggie conrad famke janssen after gang of jewel thieves headed by sean bean koster kidnaps his daughter nathan is forced to extract from his new patient the catatonic and violent elisabeth burrows murphy the location of some hidden bank job booty that her father hid from the koster gang decade ago but with hard nosed detective sandra cassidy jennifer esposito doing her best lo impression tracking down koster and his gang of hoodlums the stakes are raised as nathan races against the clock to crack the mystery of elisabeth head in order to get the goods inside the catch nathan only has until five clock to solve the puzzle whoa the suspense is almost too much don say word loses the audience inside of 15 minutes murphy looks and acts like linda blair from the exorcist during the first part of the movie then turns around and reprises like her role from girl interrupted and the only real crazy to be found in the film is director gary fleder things to do in denver when you re dead staggering use of flashback sequences oliver platt famke janssen and even sean bean are decent actors but the stuff they are given here such as bedridden wife fighting off the token siyah guy with her crutch is insulting and demeaning additionally the use of the surveillance cameras and laptops to track nathan every move is downright unbelievable how do ex cons fresh out of the big house afford all this equipment despite its flaws don say word is surprisingly some of the best mainstream film you ll find this month and audiences will lap it up americans love lukewarm half baked thrillers starring big names and accompanied by cheap thrills someone get me my lithium
some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning live action version of mr magoo being prime example the cartoon figure mr magoo the bumbling blind man can be quite funny but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls you are right but there is an even more astonishing selection for director they tapped hong kong stanley tong whose resume consists mainly of handful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan the story such that there is one is about large stolen ruby which looks woolworth reject mr magoo gets it and of course does not realize he has it mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased like home alone but without any class mr magoo can only be described as painfully bad fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity the movie humor is pathetically lame and the pacing is way off when one is stuck in theater for an hour and half watching what claims to be motion picture one looks for some solace mr magoo provides only three such moments the movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character who exudes his usual charm the only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus the sweet little bulldog angus demonstrates more genuine emotions and wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture finally the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked rather than attempt to adapt mr magoo to non cartoon movie nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be human version of the cartoon he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie but was not so lucky hopefully this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not mr magoo runs 37 it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages my son jeffrey age said he thought the movie was good and really funny but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie he said he liked home alone much more his friend maxim age said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense his other friend nickolas age said he give the movie but that it was really silly
not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing disturbing behavior with scream maybe it because they re both horror films kinda both have hot young stars both have an annoying alternative soundtrack and both are aimed at the teenage crowd which guess includes me but this is not the next in line with the scream flicks as well as the know what you did last summer soon to be flicks it owes less to halloween and more to kafka and orwell which in my book makes for more interesting feature and it should have been this is basically rehash of the stepford wives the great 70s film never saw starring katherine ross and dealing as ve been told with bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives or something like that behavior starring katie holmes of dawson creek deals with bunch of teenagers deep in angst who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers suck ups preppies it actually at least to me sounds like it would work and with scott rosenberg that witty penmen who has written stuff like beautiful girls and things to do in denver when you re dead as well as con air it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit alas it not and it plumets into that little group of movies known as the movies with potential that blow it remember film called beyaz man burden which dealt with reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with it potentially brilliant premise here another one it could be brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves it stage and this film does in fact realize that it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly now it just needs to work as film which it doesn it too sloppy and too contrived it paints bleak portrait of high school life then lets it lie it brings us bunch of scary monsters who are all bunch of disgustingly icky kiss ups who do food drives and hang out at 50s diner drinking milk shakes then gives it cheap twist when they get horny they become homicidal isn it scary enough that they re like this and can the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them not that you could be next to die the film introduces us two three different characters who in the beginning are considered outsiders because they re not yet part of this clique the new kid steve james marsden dull dull dull dull who having trouble at home because he hasn gotten over his brother ethan embry in quick flashes so you don recognize him did suicide the renegade girl rachel katie holmes from dawson creek who chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring and by far the most interesting kid gavin nick stahl the kid from the man without face who the most interesting because he the only character who given some dimension in the film best scene he introduces steve to every single clique nailing each one fetishes and hang ups and it the best scene in the movie because it witty satirical and interesting something the rest of this film isn gavin suspects there something awry with the preppie kids known as the mavi ribbons and in the tradition of all conspirators and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve he only treated as typical raving conspiracy buff here we have another case of the idiot plot where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him but he may have saved this film from being the dreary dull film that it is without gavin who gives it life and humor the only other half interesting character is the school janitor played by william sadler as retarded scary guy who may not be what he seems to be but really we don care anyway probably shouldn mention that this was directed by david nutter who works for the files because that would probably tarnish his reputation like the show he good at setting up weird conspiracies and creating general creepy feel most of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect and some of it works but what this film is not so good at is coming out with good payoff he keeps too much inside so much that when the characters journey to mental institution in the third act you wonder why they just don get the hell out of there think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there something rotten in the state of teen angstdom what this film needs to be is lot longer lot more colorful and lot creepier if the best villain they can come up with is guidance counselor played by bruce greenwood an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed then they need to come up with tougher smarter villain if he so villainous then why could two dense teenagers who couldn figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in couple minutes the film which runs about 80 or so minutes just needs to work on these things and become lot less sloppy at such short running time and with such lame boring characters as these it pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves horribly unsatisfied taste in one mouth especially mine
can horror movie truly be called horror movie if it has no scares suspense or even eerie elements think not but that what children of the corn 666 issac return wants us to believe the sixth installment in the horrible worn out series is by far the worst to date unlike the other five chapters children of the corn 666 is confusing brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror but either way none of these movies are the least bit scary the film follows hannah natalie ramsey teen looking for her mother in gatlin nebraska on the eve of her 21st birthday what starts out as daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn who roam the cornfields looking for adults to murder that about all that understandable in the film as after we learn this much issac john franklin who led the children of the corn in previous chapter now an older strange man is looking for hannah to fulfill his prophecy and this is supposed to make sense really from the start the film is unclear of where its going not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality and sub plots that have nothing to do with what seems to the main focus of the film the film runs at short 78 minutes but it seems to be more in the vicinity of two hours as the bleak slow pacing makes children of the corn 666 issac return excruciatingly boring plot holes are everywhere in tim sulka and john franklin unbelievably horrible script as nothing is accomplished or clear when the film reaches its conclusion everyone and everything involved with children of the corn 666 issac return namely writers john franklin and tim sulka along with director kari skogland should crawl under rock and hope no one sees their horrible work of trash the bottom line horrible horrible horrible another attempt to revive this worn out genre falls flat and what with that title the devil has nothing to do whatsoever with this film let pray that this is the finale in one of the worst current film series one of the worst horror films in years
when arrived in paris in june 1992 was surprised to find france plastered with posters twin peaks fire walk with me since the movie wasn scheduled to open in the until late august happily the film the prequel to david lynch cult television series was playing in fancy thx theater unfortunately the theater was far more impressive than the movie which absolutely stinks much like french lavatory worse actually fire walk with me directed by lynch will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv series or read laura palmer secret diary for twin peaks junkies like me the movie is only marginally improved the plot is jumbled and illogical not to mention excruciatingly sluggish the first 30 minutes which have almost nothing to do with the main story line feature chris isaak and kiefer sutherland as fbi agents investigating murder in portland oregon the movie then stops in philadelphia for nonsensical cameo by david bowie and brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper lynch then drops this plot strand altogether and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks washington one year later ah twin peaks familiar territory you think to yourself as angelo badalamenti distinctive musical score chimes in wrong the movie proves that you really can go home again or at least lynch can only about quarter of the characters from the tv series appear in the movie leland palmer bobby briggs james shelly leo the log lady and few others mostly in meaningless cameos the rest of the twin peaks cast is nowhere to be seen and consequently lynch fails to recreate the spirit and flavor of tv most enigmatic town cast members michael ontkean sherilyn fenn piper laurie and richard beymer are sorely missed not to mention lara flynn boyle who has been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in the crucial role of donna the movie concentrates solely on laura palmer sheryl lee as she suffers through drug abuse prostitution and incest during her miserable last seven days on earth the night of laura death which is truly terrifying is the film only remotely effective sequence we finally get to see exactly what happened to laura after she jumped off james motorcycle and ran into the woods at that lonely traffic light in the middle of nowhere her murder unfolds just as agent cooper reconstructed it in the tv series which is gratifying for faithful twin peaks viewers but it an awfully small reward for sitting through painfully awful movie
it time to take cover after hiatus of about fifteen years the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest in early 1997 there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone one on television and two in the theaters with dante peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar of the two had heard that dante peak was the better film so decided to check it out when it was released on video the film begins with slow motion scene of people in third world country trying to evacuate their little town the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is volcanic eruption flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky crushing homes and people we see people panicking people crying and even horses rearing it is disaster of biblical proportions signified to us by one person dragging cross down road symbolism doesn get much more blatant than that we learn that harry dalton pierce brosnan volcanologist with the geological survey was there with his wife when the eruption occurred harry survived but his wife did not few years later harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante peak washington which we are told has been voted second most desirable place to live under 20 000 by the readers of money magazine there harry meets rachel wando single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante peak and proprietor of small coffee shop although the mayor doesn seem to be alarmed by the presence of man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up few members of the city council are they are afraid that harry presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante peak they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug however when an amorous young couple takes skinny dip in the local hot springs they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from small fissure underneath thus begins chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption this film contains number of cliches the amorous couple is one as soon as they doff their clothes you know they re going to die the town busybody and the abrasive mother in law make appearances as does the death defying dog countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable watching the movie was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements but some of the dialogue as well unfortunate since much of the dialog is terrible for example harry boss paul charles hallahan and team from the geological survey join harry to assess the situation paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry eruption predictions aren cause for alarm this causes harry to leave in fit of rage only to turn up the next day ready for work when paul asks harry why he stayed he says with grim determination cause this town in trouble and the best man you ve got even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving he likens the situation to how frog will jump out if dropped into pot of boiling water if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up however the frog won move and will allow itself to be cooked is that your recipe for frog soup asks one of the team members it my recipe for disaster responds harry dante peak has singular talent for pointing out the obvious our heroes are in boat in the middle of lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming in very grave tone acid eats metal thanks for the tip when we first see the geological survey building there caption labeling it as such this wouldn have been so bad if it weren for the fact that the caption is right above sign on the building which reads in large letters geological survey suppose the caption is for people who can read signs although harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film the viewer has no idea why there is severe lack of chemistry between the two characters and the relationship seems rushed because of this when they get close to kissing was asking myself why do they want to kiss were they even attracted to each other if were the mayor would sure think twice about kissing guy who doesn even crack smile through the whole movie trying to pull off the rough yet debonair act who does he think he is james bond the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed there are several warning signs prior to the eruption itself but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don feel as if they are leading up to anything for example one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve remote controlled robot tremor occurs does he plunge headlong to his death is he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below no couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg the sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene which suppose was intended to be dramatic as well it wasn one plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante peak in disaster movie there usually one guy who greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption fire earthquake explosion tsunami tornado meteorite and usually gets killed by the disaster it okay of course because we all think he got what he deserved if you re going to be unoriginal you might as well go all the way in dante peak the city councilmembers are concerned but they don really try hard enough maybe the mayor abrasive mother in law should have been the one for no apparent reason she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate there are couple of good things about this movie the first is the scenery there are panoramic shots of forests lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful the second is the special effects they are the closest ve ever seen to real pyroclastic eruption but when elements which don speak are going to be the best parts of your movie you probably better rewrite the script
capsule ham handed and over underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment so muddled it doesn even know what it really advocating if anything time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations and it easy to see why it presents strong almost rancorously so story it is full of good actors samuel jackson matthew mcconaughey sandra bullock kevin spacey charles dutton and it ostensibly about some important social issue that we re all tangling with it is not however good movie and all of the reasons ve listed above have something to do with why right from the beginning the movie is dead set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible pair of redneck whites boozed and drugged out of their minds kidnap young siyah girl abuse and rape her horribly and leave her for dead after their arrest their father jackson takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial mcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics the acting is not quite what it should be given the cast we have sandra bullock who is good actress but not serious one looks clueless spacey accent switches itself on and off at random and he given totally thankless role to play as well role without an iota of depth and mcconaughey role is stamped from the cardboard back of cereal box the most memorable role is donald sutherland and his is bit part always consider it an index of movie desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact there is one scene riot outside the courtroom that should have created incredible tension but winds up playing out like textbook exercise on how not to deploy scene like this because the movie doesn know what it really about it can generate any genuine tension and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting one of the ways it does this is by throwing in whole subplot about bunch of vicious kkk cross burners which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic was reminded of the despicable betrayed which tried to tart up fundamentally empty story by injecting vile graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention getter the movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making few critical mistakes first of all the jackson character is not hard to judge there no tension in his dilemma he self admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail no matter how moral his crusade the old saw about how no court in the land would convict him if he was beyaz is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie but it never developed into an organic component of the story it just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics another mistake is in motivational logic by not having the two beyaz thugs arraigned first or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence say we have that much less empathy for jackson character probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped we are automatically supposed to feel empathy for him but that precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible see the virgin spring for more on that note is jackson character then simply insane that prospect isn given terribly serious treatment either one of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works or how lawyers get their information mcconaughey character makes an important slipup late in the movie when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of capital offense how did the prosecution get this information how come he didn get it the whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam bang fashion this is the biggest problem the movie isn about jackson character or his dilemma or this case or any of its frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction characters it not ultimately about anything at all except its stupid geared down plot which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards totally contrived ending at two and half hours the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten there endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing and no writing about the material that should really matter it all handwaving the closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair it not easy to make movie about something the other day saw kurosawa phenomenal rashomon movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality or don time to kill is as empty and ponderous movie as ve seen in long time
the catch phrase for disney rocket man is one spoken by fred randall harland williams the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes it wasn me he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is williams can take all the blame but he sure can justify himself with his own simple tag line either fred has dreamed of space travel since he was young boy turning the clothes dryer into mock space shuttle and staring out wide eyed at poster of the earth as 30 year old fred hasn grown up much but at least he somewhat closer to his goal now designing astronaut software for nasa when an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void fred yes although he an obviously klutzy moron nasa doesn think twice about throwing him into rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program and time itself has ever known for the first part of the film we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park he laughs he screams but he never once breaks sweat or views the preparation as anything more than child play his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many record breaking feats much to the dismay of cocky counterpart mission commander captain overbeck william sadler who once held the records overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the kirmizi planet one being astronaut julie ford the stupids jessica lundy and the other being chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist from here on out we are subjected to one lame gag after another dealing with snot laxatives and flatulence you know standard kid movie material almost sounding like poor james stewart impressionist williams is awful in his first starring role we get the feeling that if jerry lewis and pee wee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring williams would be it while he not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany stupid comedy he just as unlikeable to say it more understandably jim carrey might annoy you more but this guy is even less funny why because while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such role his performance is too understated and boring classic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy stan laurel for example was so innocent in all his trouble making that we were immediately fond of him peter sellers as inspector clouseau was so self assured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip it was humor at it best williams on the other hand can garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his anti glory as for the rest of the cast including some bigger names in smaller roles beau bridges and shelley duvall nobody is worth watching whatsoever this is just another example of the fast food equivalent of cinema mass produced less than mediocre over priced and hard to stomach giving it one and half stars is extremely generous but even ll admit to laughing few times the amazing thing is that even in theater packed with little kids laughter was something rarely heard even from the children must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didn crack up over every little thing then again maybe they were asleep some people might think critics are harsh on kid movies claiming adults aren the targeted audience and therefore aren meant to and won enjoy them sadly it also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if it presented right two hour still shot of dog with cartoonish voice over could entertain lot of toddlers out there but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast which could easily do the same thing and saying that parent perspective isn important is quite poor theory to have when they re the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place
couple of criminals mario van peebles and loretta devine move into rich family house in hopes of conning them out of their jewels however someone else steals the jewels before they are able to get to them writer mario van peebles delivers clever script with several unexpected plot twists but director mario van peebles undermines his own high points with haphazard camera work editing and pacing it felt as though the film should have been wrapping up at the hour mark but alas there was still 35 more minutes to go daniel baldwin can believe about to type this gives the best performance in the film outshining the other talented members of the cast [r]
synopsis melissa mentally disturbed woman who likes to smoke seduces doug minor league baseball player who likes to study anatomy work on motorcycles and make out with his girlfriend in public library when doug decides to stop seeing her melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him including his girlfriend his mother and his cat comments malicious suppose is an acceptable moview for what it is cheap movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurned psycho lover who wants revenge films like fatal attraction hand that rocks the cradle etc etc that have come before it malicious however really doesn provide very many particularly suspenseful moments the plot starts off energetically enough the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film it starts to drag unfortunately after this melissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug as always seems to happen in movies like these but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other better thrillers before she drugs someone she kills family pet and leaves it in the girlfriend apartment and of course she stalks so we see number of shots which are supposed to be suspenseful where she spying on doug and his girlfriend won reveal the ludicrous ending to this turkey but warn you that it both painfully obvious and real yawner john vernon does remarkably good job at playing the not so bright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa one of the script faults is to try to pass off character like this as pre med student the same cannot be said though for molly ringwald at times she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine especially during her silent going to stare you down scenes at other times however she just seems somehow goofy and out of place in one particular scene which guess was supposed to be suspenseful she screeches you you and throws phone she delivers the line so ridiculously that one can help but laugh malicious certainly isn the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there but it isn all that good or original either feel free to treat this film maliciously watch something else
backdrop of new year eve in 1981 would seem to lend itself to great party movie the decor possibilities are endless disco balls had yet to migrate into the dark corners of the attic big hair was worth its weight in aquanet and the louder the fashion the better the look but despite this setting these details and soundtrack that includes some 40 plus irresistible hits from the early days of the me decade something is inherently wrong with 200 cigarettes better title for this nostalgic mess would be 50 missed opportunities what is it that makes this retro comedy such downer it certainly not the cast which includes enough hot young talent for several movies there courtney love cementing her reputation as serious actress christina ricci hot off her shoulda been nominated turn in the opposite of sex paul rudd who gets even more appealing with every role kate hudson inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn and affleck brothers ben and casey two of the best things about good will hunting perhaps the question is this what drew these and other immensely talented actors to such dreary project maybe it looked good on paper 200 cigarettes is composed of series of vignettes as various characters make their way through new york festively decorated east village to holiday bash thrown by jittery bundle of nerves named monica martha plimpton all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper among the potential guests are likeable cad kevin rudd and his best friend lucy love busy bickering over his recent break up and clumsy but seemingly charming bartender ben affleck who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pick up lines more subplots _many_ more dot the big picture but those listed above are the only ones worth noting in positive light all the other story tangents are as frazzled as cokehead trying to solve rubick cube ricci and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants out to have high time in the big city infamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to several scene cameo hudson as pretty in pink klutz recently devirginized by reprehensible ladies man jay mohr trips pukes and gets smeared with dog poop are we laughing yet the film boils down to mixture of the good the bad and the gaudy with the latter two overtaking the former game performances especially by love rudd and plimpton are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts and constantly roving focus here combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle too many sidetracks rate as uninteresting and have little payoff until lengthy final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one night stands for each other if this is 200 cigarettes then get me 200 nicotine patches
there is scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of courtroom surrounded by people who are giving him lively standing ovation because of his strong worded attack on group of stoic doctors when noticed that the audience with whom saw this film was reacting the same way realized that was going to have hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture you see patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries hated this movie for every second that sat watching it and actively hate it now days later with the simpering superficial nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories hate every element of the film beginning with tom shadyac shameless direction and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey the badness of patch adams is stupefying it confounding can believe film can be this bad and yet it based on real man who probably has good point to make in the film patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams in performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that wonder now if he is even human in the beginning of the film patch commits himself to mental institution because he doesn want to kill himself while there he notices that the doctors don care about the patients and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings so patch goes on crusade to be great doctor who actually talks to his patients he goes to medical school where he meets truman daniel london and convinces him that it good to help people he also meets carin fischer monica potters the anti male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be successful doctor naturally the dean of the medical school bob gunton hates patch and wants to thwart his plans even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams so patch decides that he going to build free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have and that my friends is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 on superficial level the film is not particularly bad wouldn say the cinematography bothered me and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for actually liked potter performance even if she is wasted but the film fails fundamentally in execution every scene swells with grand emotional music played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard take for instance the first scene which shows patch sitting on bus we don know patch yet but there sad music and it supposed to make us really sad that he sad later on patch makes lot of progress he helps dying patient peter coyote to enjoy the last days of his life and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively and when that patient finally dies spoiler alert the music is very very sad but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions real drama is character based you grow to like someone and then something bad happens and you feel it we don ever grow to know the dying patient he simply vehicle for patch greatness real drama doesn seem forced or present just to make the audience cry that why patch adams is not real drama it goes for every cheap tear imaginable wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman sickening musical score sentimentality like this is indeed bad but it not as bad as half baked simplistic themes you see patch is really great student he aces his tests without studying and does it so effectively that people think he cheating but patch doesn think that memorizing facts is the way to become good doctor why don we see patients until the third year he bursts out every three seconds well patch that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort most of us have to study and doctor who really wants to help but doesn know toe from finger probably won be too successful in preventing death oh wait almost forgot the point of doctors is not just to prevent death but to improve the quality of life yes that is true and you can not do that without studying you can not do that without going to medical school what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe just maybe it is good idea to study first and talk to patients later follow the rules bah who needs the rules only uptight doctors follow the rules the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big kirmizi spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants and then there the free clinic issue which find shockingly frighteningly idealistic free clinic in the middle of the forest where patients can be taken to be helped for free how will patients be transported to the free clinic will it have an emergency room or is it just for mental patients and who may ask will pay for it the film does give some token attempts to question patch motives think another character asks him how he going to pay for it in addition to little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance but they certainly don explore or challenge patch ideas to any meaningful extent reader please understand this am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams know nothing about him if his beliefs mirror those of this film character then might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them but regardless of what the real patch adams believes the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony and in the last scene the big obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus patch does lot of shouting actually robin williams does lot of shouting he shouts lot about helping people and lot of people cry because they are moved by his words won tell you that you can be moved by his words because too was moved by his words was moved in such profoundly negative way that was reminded of how cheap and phony cinematic experience can be patch adams is the cheapest of them all
staring george clooney arnold schwarzenegger chris donnell and uma thurman with alicia silverstone well to start this off just like to say couple things first is miss michael keaton miss tim burton and would much prefer to think that these last two batman films are all like dallas dream sequence not even from the first film was batman really the star though he was damn close in the first couple anyway in batman forever and now in batman robin he almost pushed to being bit player can really say if clooney who regardless was better than kilmer was very good batman or not he given next to nothing to do at all he might as well not have been there and it wouldn have made much difference now joel schumacher has said that he refuses to bend to the masses that have hated his films and cheered for the return of buton that he wont make batman brooding and dark fine mean granted batman returns while being an awsome film was bit to dark sometimes yet his bright neon campy style is just killing anything this series meant to me usually very easy on films loved con air and other films some critics have slammed granted that film really was paper thin cliche ridden except for one thing it was fun there is virtually no fun in this film at all couldn have cared less it ll thrill the little ones as theres no violence really none everyone comes out fine in the end like those old tv shows where it ends with everyone laughing schwarzenegger is awful mean really really bad and this is coming from regular fan of his work love his movies most of the time and the basic reason is he never says much in any of them he talks all to often in this movie would have much prefered to have seen patric stewart in the roll believe to truely like film you have to care about at least someone in film liked alfred but the reason behind it is cheap shot
this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard the rock and roller is asked to carry the film as the action antihero of australian legend ned kelly the so called robin hood of the aussies but he fails to be convincing in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly the film opens to prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution then it goes to technicolor and ned is seen in what goes for flashback coming home from jail after year sentence to see his mom and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family this scene is set in 1871 in the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings as he sings shel silverstein lyrics which tells of ned hatred for the british rule and hope for ireland to be republic ned says debt must be paid as he hears voices from his dead father his class divided country and his conscience all telling him to get revenge so begins ned romp through australia outback seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered he begins by stealing horses after complaining about the unfair tax law on horses that stray which favors the rich landowners when he only 20 he forms gang causing him to hide the rest of his life from the police who put price on his head of two thousand pounds when ned mother clarissa kaye is jailed on false charge of abetting criminals and sentenced to years ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mother freedom when the authorities refuse the kelly brothers go on robbing rampage burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults and murdering some soldiers rampaging through the outback they gather sympathy among the poor and lower classes who don trust the traps police spoiler to follow in the next paragraph in the climax kelly and his gang plan to ambush train with british police but someone kelly trusted tips the police on the train and kelly is trapped in saloon and captured ned brothers commit suicide rather than be taken alive but kelly gang escapes as ned heroically has the police go after only him and his brothers as they become decoys this was flat presentation hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kelly call for justice jagger didn have prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson the story failed to focus on australia seemingly more british film than australian under richardson lackluster direction all jagger seemed to do was proclaim his innocence and vow revenge which soon became shrill cry if you want to see better film about ned kelly catch mad dog morgan 76 much truer and more daring version with dennis hopper giving much better characterization of ned kelly madness something this film could only do in ho hum manner
michael crichton has had long career of writing novels many of which are science fiction the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of michael crichton science fiction novel so in the logic of the film industry good way to make profitable film would be to make big budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel congo failed and am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare whole lot better it little better than just okay novel and it makes film that is not even that good the film is expensive over one hundred million dollars is long 133 minutes has terrific cast including dustin hoffman samuel jackson and sharon stone but has little that is really original and less that is exciting several years ago dr norman goodman played by dustin hoffman was asked to write up set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered the plan he wrote was only semi serious but did explicitly define team of experts who should investigate the alien now that team has been assembled by mysterious team leader named barnes peter coyote to study spacecraft almost half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s suddenly norman less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with real alien spacecraft included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams samuel jackson biologist beth halperin sharon stone and astrophysicist ted fielding liev schreiber together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship what is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects the problem here is he is making big budget science fiction film it has some effects but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on radar screen the technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewer imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting that could be reasonable approach in low budget film but that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster it requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put they don hoffman acting seems muted jackson seems to laid back we do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads levinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance and why we have queen latifah as minor functionary on the expedition is anybody guess cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at fraction of the price look how much more powerful film like alien was with only moderate actors most science fiction spectaculars these days have second tier actors and first tier special effects levinson tries second tier effects and first tier actors but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer perhaps sci fi spectaculars are just not an actor medium the result gets on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale
these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes but only few years ago before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south the way to regain popularity and prestige they thought was the use the same formulas characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place one of such celebrity was eddie murphy siyah comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade in order to return to the spotlight he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film beverly hills cop 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987 seven years later for the third instalment he used the directorial service of john landis another fading star with whom he successfully collaborated twice in trading places and coming to america this time however third time wasn the charm and beverly hills iii was failure eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback eddie murphy here plays axel foley fast talking streetwise detroit policeman who raids illegal chop shop the routine police action ends in tragedy when the criminals kill foley boss determined to bring the killers to justice foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald timothy carhart when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles foley goes back to los angeles there with the help of his old friend local policeman rosewood judge rheinhold foley would clash with money counterfeit ring ten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different in this decade the contrast between mavi collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills which provided lot of gags in 1984 film simply doesn work screenwriter steven de souza provides another conflict this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business like professionalism of the bad guys since foley belongs to the former his character had to watch his language and the tone of the film in general is more infantile unfortunately this film still belongs to action movie genre and there is too much violence for little children nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath unlike donner with the lethal weapon series landis simply can balance the comedy with regular action and the result is film that fails in both aspects action scenes are sometimes interesting but not too spectacular at the end scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself humour on the other hand falls flat to make even worse some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure especially art expert turned into arms dealer played by bronson pinchot in the end although the film provided some entertainment viewers at least critical ones would probably be happy to know that there aren any plans for beverly hills iv
although had not been viewer of the rugrats television series went into their first animated feature film the rugrats movie with positive attitude the trailer looked cute enough after all after seeing it think the words in my recent antz review in which stated that it was the worst film of its type since 1995 the pebble and the penguin were bit premature the rugrats movie is bottom of the barrel children fare at its worst and starts to make antz look good in comparison as in the show the rugrats movie is about group of very little friends ranging from babies to three year old the head of the group tommy pickles daily becomes distraught when his mother has newborn baby named dill get it dill pickles hardee har har and is informed by his three year old cousin anjelica cheryl chase that the new babies always take all of the attention away from the other children when the other children chuckie and twins lil and phil suggest taking dill back to the hospital tommy goes along with it but on their way there they crash in the forest and become lost running into wolves and circus monkeys among other things the rugrats movie judging from the idea of being lost in the woods could have been potentially fun family film and there were many different things that could have been done with the story so what did the writers choose to do why they set up protracted cliched scene where the children almost go over waterfall of course for the youngest of children ages the rugrats movie may very well entertain them judging from the audience saw this with of course if you looked around at all of the older kids and their parents they were all desperately struggling to stay awake and that included me for an adult the rugrats movie is piece of garbage the plotline is unoriginal and the writing has absolutely no wit or charm there isn one laugh to be had in the film nor is there any excitement if anything is even marginally good in the picture it is the bright animation style so it is especially unfortunate that it wasn to service more quality film the rugrats movie is doa from the start am all for worthwhile family movie but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful as said before young children may like it but even they deserve better than this for adults it is nearly unbearable excruciating chore to sit through as for me the rugrats movie is not the worst of the year nor is it the most deeply hated but it is the most boring parents do yourselves favor and take your kids to see the rerelease of the wizard of oz that is picture that contains great deal of magic and wonder two things of which the rugrats movie is completely missing
plunkett macleane is period piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions have nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking used properly it can save movie see stigmata but it ruins this one making muddled incoherent mess out of potentially interesting premise there are certain genres that just don go together the film opens with sequence that still don understand it involves some sort of prison outbreak robbery and gem that keeps being eaten in any case the caper whatever it may be brings together plunkett and macleane robert carlyle and johnny lee miller respectively two happy go lucky brits with no way to make living they make pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves until they earn enough money to buy ticket to america their first heist involves young debutante named lady rebecca liv tyler woman macleane was especially friendly with at party just earlier his decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks the name gentleman highwaymen lady rebecca also happens to be the niece of the lord chief justice glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career he demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately leaving the job in the hands of the devious chance ken stott who has few more things on his mind than catching criminals meanwhile macleane falls in love with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett who doesn want his plans to be foiled by his partner mindless romantic travails director jake scott son of ridley scott alien blade runner has his father knack for setting up atmospheric shots but none of his skill in actually moving the camera most of the action scenes are filmed in such rapid jerky way that it impossible to comprehend what going on the camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity instead of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events scott uses attention deficit disorder edits he barely ever holds shot for more than ten seconds and during the faster scenes it seems more like couple frames between each cut the weird almost defiant lack of dialogue there are no no conversations lasting over say 20 seconds undermines character definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters the love affair between macleane and rebecca is no different emotionless and unrealistic when the script calls for macleane to decide between going to america and going to meet his lover there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for him to abandon his goal he and rebecca barely even speak to each other throughout the film plunkett and macleane wants desperately to be triumph of style over substance but since its style quite frankly blows the film has no hope of succeeding on any level wanted to appreciate this movie on the basis of its admittedly kinetic pace but couldn it was so kinetic it gave me headache
my giant begins with monologue that more funny than not and distinctive `princess bride medieval fairy tale in the 90s feel was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was with very funny scenes occurring on movie set in romania where talent agent sammy billy crystal is visiting client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into stream and when sammy meets max his giant mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan there is magic in the air albeit it bit goofy loved every minute of it the film of course plays on the size difference between the two and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects particularly enjoyed shot of sammy dangling his legs from max sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons also liked jere burns from tv `something so right performance as the director of the film in romania at this point the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand particularly during his fast paced first scene it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate as did understand him more as the film continued and became accustomed to his speech however about the time muresan becomes coherent the characters head to new york and the film takes dive off the high board suddenly we are expected to believe sammy is do whatever it takes slime ball up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure but he didn come off as desperate jerk if he had the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical but now in new york we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son and his character is desperate enough to involve max in disturbing giant vs midgets wrestling match which found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film indeed many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal when sammy gets max role in big hollywood movie filming in las vegas while enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation rather than because the film demanded it and the audience is required to take huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare at this point found myself thinking `we re supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in film then realized he was and was watching it in the final third the film undergoes another transformation this time to unbridled sentimentality note major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love lillianna who hasn seen him since he was normal sized kid her refusal to see max unbeknownst to him leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means scene as sammy wife serena played nicely by kathleen quinlan poses as lillianna found this scene offensive not only did it rely on deception to induce warm fuzzy feelings from the audience it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle which thought was quite undeserved think max could have handled the truth gratuitous illness and all late in the film we learn max and in fact all giants have heart condition which shortens their lives considerably this could be an enlightening revelation but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy transformation into caring sensitive guy and hey great dad and husband too `my giant suffers from poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy struggles to get money and become better person in this scenario max illness could have been integral part of the film not story motivator sentiment and emotion would have followed naturally instead we re apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end but we re not allowed to focus on max crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances but in the end `my giant left me feeling like been fed gruel from giant spoon
filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up dull dreary and overused idea doug liman swingers director of the ultra hip and severely dark comedy go is an example of just such filmmaker in his latest he gives the viewers raucous neon lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down drug infested path of misadventure as director but he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi tiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same his movie is produced anthology style telling the same story from multiple three points of view much as an author might write serial novel consistent with this ethic liman and screenwriter john august provide bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives the thread that laces the three stories together is drug deal and the events thereafter in story we have checkout clerk ronna sarah polley looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it in story we have regular drug dealer simon desmond askew gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity and in story we have gay soap actors zack jay mohr and adam scott wolf working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal neither of the three stories have much substance and the movie has the feel of campfire story albeit rather strange one that could be told in five to ten minutes in fact the movie was originally short film entitled expanded to feature length the early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie christmas setting and the los angeles las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater goers to attach themselves to the characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite and performances from little known players like polley askew and taye diggs don help or hurt the roles in fact even bigger names like mohr wolf and katie holmes don have enough time to make substantial success although that almost expected for lack of continuous screen time the success in the picture should come from thread that binds the stories go doesn have this and it suffers because of it as far as teen movies are concerned go represents the absolute bottom for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme the following do not count as common themes drug deals people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them at times the humor in go is sickly funny and on low night almost watchable but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on saturday night
joe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made in very recent memory the strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it it has solid cast with tom hanks meg ryan as the lead roles but you can never judge movie by its cast if there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano it is that the plot is original unfortunately it is also incredibly stupid the movie begins with joe tom hanks going to work this opening sequence is very boring and slow it shows joe walking to his office but on the way he has to wait in long line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting sequence like this should take minutes here it takes over it is obvious that joe hates his job at his office one of his co workers is meg ryan oddly enough she plays different roles in this movie joe leaves to go to doctor appointment his doctor informs him that he has brain cloud this means that in few months he will die so what does joe do quit his job of course when he arrives home joe meets an old man named graynamore lloyd bridges graynamore tells joe that in order to get some important mineral for his company from an island the natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcano to please their fire god by startling coincidence the boat trip to the island takes few months by the time he reaches the island he will almost be dead from the brain cloud anyway so joe agrees graynamore gives joe credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this great adventure joe goes on date with meg ryan his co worker the day before the boat trip joe meets one of graynamore daughters she is also surprise meg ryan except she looks more hippyish they both have dinner and the next day joe gets driven over to his boat the lady that sails the boat is another one of graynamore daughters and wonder of wonders she is also played by meg ryan as they sail to the island meg ryan tells joe that the natives of the island have craving for orange soda after some stupid talking scenes they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went to and that the brain cloud thing was made up they do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage joe goes fishing and catches hammerhead shark this is cheap gag that has been pulled off many times but to top it off the shark is obviously rubber and fake one night there is storm cheap looking lightning bolt strikes the boat and everything is cast overboard fortunately joe and meg ryan manage to find some of the luggage that joe brought to sail by pure luck they get to the island since the natives like orange soda they wear soda cans as attire stupid or what before joe leaps in the volcano he gets fed right before he jumps meg ryan pleads him not to when joe decides to she goes in with him because she loves him now this is where the movie should end but unfortunately the cheesy ending bug comes in the volcano blows the couple out and into the ocean where they land on joe luggage they float to another part of the island as they watch lava pouring out of the volcano towards the villagers give this movie see it only if you re film buff that enjoys bad movie every now and then or if you really like tom hanks or meg ryan
flubber is the second best example of how to take all the life out of film remake an adaptation and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney it the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids but anyone else will feel left out as it boring slow and incredibly lifeless what could be film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water and it shame because it could have been great film hypothetically mean flubber as you probably know is remake of the disney classic never saw the absent minded professor where well absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as flubber you know flying rubber the new one keeps the basic plot but appears to have added lot else like more absent mindedness on the part of the proffessor some more villains and several show stopping moments like big rumba with the flubber and some more elaborate setups none which really make it any better but instead make it worse the basic plot revolves around college professor philip brainerd robin williams who creates lots and lots of inventions but is sadly absent minded in fact he forgotten his wedding to the college president sara jean reynolds indie actress marcia gay harden two times before he forgets it again at the beginning doesn this warrant some kind of mental treatment anyway on his wedding day the third one he invents the flubber which not only bounces off of everything like super ball on speed but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in the abyss philip believes that this invention once fully realized will save his college which is in threat of being shut down by millionaire tycoon villain chester hoenicker raymond barry which is ironically enough the same college his brat son will wheaton thought he was dead goes to through plot twist hoenicker goons named smith and wesson ha ha what great sense of humor this film has who are played by clancy brown and ted levine both who needed the pay check discover it the hard way and try to steal for hoenicker who wants it just cause he evil enough sub plot involves philip attempts to win back sara who angry at him and with good reason but who is being seduced by who is basically philip belloq wilson croft christopher mcdonald playing the hysterically suave yet unsuave asswhole once again and in another subplot philip day timer robot weebo voiced by the one and only jodi benson falls in love with him yuckity yuck what most pathetic about this film is how dull it is you don need to be cynical college student to be able to see right through this film which is another in long line of cheap attempts at making quick buck by disney who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry half assedly re mixing classics or non classics for distribution to the general public who sadly eats it all up earlier in 97 they released jungle jungle an adaptation of really awful french film un indien dans la ville which yeah improved over the original but not by much disney in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now only creatively in the rush to ship out film for distribution disney has forgotten to give this film little thing called magic such scenes as dancing flubber flying car basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze delight or even cause people to laugh sat there the entire film stone faced chuckling perhaps twice and shaking my head at all the bad jokes who could really laugh at scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry didn think so it doesn help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable philip is not lovable absent minded professory just really dumb man being played by robin williams williams is brilliant comic actor okay brilliant actor in general but here he given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something and other times act sad those times he not bad but what are we supposed to think of man who forgotten his wedding thrice maybe it was funny and or respectable in the 60s like disney and usually enjoy their films not only animated but live action and their recent films save for hercules which was good but not great have been worse than lackluster they ve been pathetic jungle jungle is probably the worst film saw last year flubber probably second what do they need to do perhaps create something new get writers who can write something that universally entertaining films like the parent trap and mary poppins are films that are live action or in the latter case mix of both but even can still watch them because they re not only written to be magical to children but to be fun to adults what more torturous that taking child to film that insults you and annoys you at every turn and my god couldn they have done something else with edie mcclurg
tina fetch me the axe favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 paramount soon realised they had problem on their hands it wasn just the film disappointing box office performance indeed in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two three even six times no the main problem was that what was intended as serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year in desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming mommie dearest the biggest mommie of them all executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn but it was all too late mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history unfortunately faye dunaway energetic at times ridiculously over the top performance is about the film only redeeming feature based on daughter christina crawford trashy biography mommie dearest chronicles series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother if you believe this movie it was life was racked by obsession lonliness child abuse and rampant egomania the film begins with crawford adopting two children and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother will joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves you see but that about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film end the script laboured over by four writers bad sign in itself is poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum frank perry direction is no more than competent and dunaway bitchy lines aside the dialogue is flat and uninvolving in fairness the film second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop degree empathy for its characters when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling joan visits and keeps in touch not helping her financially but encouraging christina own acting and career ambitions crawford does seem to care about her daughter but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers ah but there is dunaway performance and what delicious piece of campery it often is having just been sacked by her studio after run of box office duds crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she making spotting young tree she doesn like the look of she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line tina fetch me the axe with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling in the film most outrageous scene joan realises that some of her daughter clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers oh dear sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum doesn it this time she gives her daughter horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst no wire hangers ever and later when the board of her late husband company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship she displays superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring don fuck with me fellas oh joy something of camp classic then but if that not you re cup of tea then mommie dearest doesn have too much to recommend it better you see the real crawford in the women 1939 mildred pierce 1945 or whatever happened to baby jane 1962 great films distinguished by great performances and far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perry shrieking piece of tabloid froth
didn come into city of angels expecting greatness ve never seen wim wenders wings of desire the classic movie upon which city is loosely based then again have seen enough stories which are based upon similar plot device with the little mermaid both the disney version and the original folktale being among them that had some high expectations about the possible power such story of impossible love can hold unfortunately city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them the plot for those that couldn tell from the previews revolves around the angel seth played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage who in the midst of his angelic duties falls in love with heart surgeon named maggie meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally of course his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her watch her buy groceries only to disappear in the blink of an eye their love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human using this framework as jumping off point the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire the joys of being human and the definition of perfection the first half of the movie succeeds on most points cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn know feelings so can really express preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hang dog expressions unfortunately cage takes the intensity too far sometimes and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive as maggie ryan manages to be convincing as heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost patient on the operating table despite having done everything right her beauty unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss is mature intelligent and winning likewise some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film when the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen the audience experiences little of what it must be like to be an angel the beautiful camera work shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels also gives us sense of the unique wonder angels feel the film begins to lose its way though when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie the grand angelic perspective gets lost except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angel eyes the movie devolves into an examination of how seth can feel the world or more importantly he can feel maggie he can smell her hair feel her touch or taste the pears she eats this change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seth intense longing but in doing so the conflict disappears if he wants maggie so badly then why doesn her just make the leap and become human after all what so great about being an angel sure you get to sit on marlboro signs but what that compared to getting to be with meg ryan and from there once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur it all downhill the philosophy becomes heavy handed the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep and the plot twists simply attempt to yank few more tears into the audience hankie it the last thirty minutes of the movie then that wrecks the film feel like the writer by pulling out all the melodramatic stops has robbed me of what could have been genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level came out feeling robbed seeing so much possibility in film becoming nothing could go on longer but don want to ruin the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on city of angels then is paradox it well acted particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type casting as happy go lucky fallen angel well filmed and based on wonderful idea all these possibilities though are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up
ll be the first to admit it when you mention the book great expectations immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class where was confronted with torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch yes it classic of literature but it was rather dry one shoved down my young throat like spoonful of bitter medicine certainly the experience wasn truly that bad but to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book not going to tell the story the way it happened ll gonna tell it the way remember it anyway to return from nostalgia lane and get back to the present hollywood in it trendy attempt to modernize the classics now presents an updated film version of great expectations instead of pip this time the central character is named finn played as boy by jeremy kissner and by ethan hawke as an adult finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie or should that be mrs joe kim dickens and her boorish fisherman husband joe chris cooper the setting is the florida coast during the mid 70s finn is blooming artist and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish one of his two favorite subjects during one of these escapades he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal robert deniro borrowing page from the superhuman max cady deniro criminal has seemingly limitless lung capacity and favors hiding on the ocean floor ok maybe that an exaggeration but he certainly beats any of houdini records in the opening scenes of the film and that nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn motorboat but digress anyway finn does the convict good deed just to show that he really swell guy and then the plot moves on enter miss havisham or ms dinsmoor here anne bancroft abandoned at the altar some 26 years ago ms dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid with bizarre clothing eccentric mannerisms and few pounds of makeup anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role although she ends up nowhere near believable character she does add some humor to the film joe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner but the insane ms dinsmoor soon hires finn to be plaything for her niece estella raquel beaudene as young girl gwyneth paltrow as an adult for no apparent reason other than to provide the main plot of the film finn is instantly stricken for the estella perhaps it her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person or maybe finn has simply never met girl before in any case neither as children nor adults chemistry simply doesn exist between the two and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her even when as an adult finn arrives in new york at the behest of mysterious benefactor reacquaints himself with estella and draws her portrait in the nude there nothing in fact there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnear gay artist during similar scene in as good as it gets at this point the audience has grown as cold and detached as estella character and couldn care less about the two characters the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow she fails to imbue estella remote character in the book with even the vaguest traces of humanity there obviously something wrong when watching the film you re more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character without strong estella finn obsession seems baseless you wish he would just stop whining let estella marry his rival walter plane an oddly subdued hank azaria and just get on with his life in fact the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot finn relationship with his brother in law joe is interesting if bit stereotypical what more fascinating are his interactions with deniro although it only bit part it goes to show how much vitality strong actor can create it is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put lot of work in creating the imagery of the film some of the shots work but others are too obviously staged for example both of the water fountain scenes to have any impact finn art actually the creations of italian painter francesco clemente is used throughout the film but it mostly fails to have the intended effect we never see why finn would generate this style of art which is simultaneously crude and insightful as result it ends up as distant as the rest of the film modernizing the classics is currently in vogue just see william shakespeare romeo+juliet simply update the action to modern setting and apply plenty of modern rock but such adornments do little to perk up great expectations as much as dreaded the novel when first read it you probably be better off suffering though reading than watching this romanceless film
new address same old attitude don forget to recommend film read the journal or send me some of that nasty hate mail starring bruce willis billy bob thornton liv tyler ben affleck written by jonathan hensleigh and abrams directed by michael bay it rocks actually lots of rocks fly at us or from us in slow or fast motion at several points in the film they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward and when they land once in while when we need break from the space sequences they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like nary mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon steroid user answer to deep impact bruce willis stars as harry stamper famed oil driller commissioned by the beyaz house and nasa to stop giant asteroid before it travels beyond zero barrier and destroys our planet why an oil driller they require someone experienced with deep core mining to plant nuclear missile into said asteroid in one unintentionally hilarious sequence nasa asks harry to inspect deep core driller they built based on his own blueprints it is poorly constructed harry criticizes almost every aspect of it we trust nasa to build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids harry assembles the obligatory ragtag bunch of cowboys including blond guy fat guy siyah guy wiseass and the man who is sleeping with his daughter affleck once they reach space we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong perhaps the fact that they sent bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes whether or not they save the day will not reveal nor will you care will say this you know you re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope willis has barely chance to come alive ditto for affleck their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act in last minute and futile attempt to inject warmth into the material steve buscemi character the wiseass is exceptionally problematic rockhound as he called is sarcastic and foolish so they tape him to chair where he spends most of the film so why did they bring him up there to begin with rather why write him into the film give his almost witty one liners to serious willis who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel at least in my world where the sky is mavi liv tyler is pretty and humourless as always suspiciously four of her father band aerosmith songs grace the soundtrack director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick like ketchup eventually drowning the movie on screen the middle hour is non sensical pyrotechnic assault on the average primate brain whenever someone dies in this movie crew member inevitably yells out we lost insert dead person last name here must admit that not once could distinguish dead oil guy cum astronaut from live one and close ups of the corpses faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance as their skin was often covered in fake blood armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla it looks nicer and has fewer plot holes within its equally ludicrous framework it has vivid soundmix but at almost two and half hours could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story the love story has been played up in the ads perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic fever bollocks the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in moon crawler remember little film called jaws in this film three independent minded men suddenly found themselves on fishing boat in pursuit of deadly shark they didn much like each other at first eventually they started to respect one another one of jaws great scenes involved the would be ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories this is the sort of male bonding foreign to bay or his producer jerry bruckheimer who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before action was called male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps cannot relate to bunch of men who don bare their souls who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and kind of chest beating bravery to this will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic nor brave nor smart even this team couldn build birdhouse and if get no respect for disliking movie with all the synthetic feeling of trailer trailer for movie written by team of body builders and greeting card authors ve never been prouder wimp my whole life
plot two sister witches have to live with curse placed upon their family which prevents them from ever enjoying full life with lover the hex invokes the eventual demise of their loved one when one of their past loves comes back to haunt them they have to figure way out of their eternal dilemma critique ve been waiting for good witch movie for while now but hold on to your brooms and incantations cause this puppy is far from being it for film that has the word magic in its title this movie contains very few moments of magic or humor for that matter drama suspense or romance well actually there is some manufactured romance within plot that is so muddled it never lets you in on whether it comedy drama horror show or murder mystery or maybe it romance eh it doesn really matter cause the characters in the film are so boring and uninteresting that you have absolutely no basis on which to care for them or the film as whole if only the filmmakers had spent as much time on the plot as they did the sinfully obvious soundtrack this film might ve had chance to be more than what it is now which is an unentertaining crappy film that uses the witch angle as diversionary tactic to weave us away from its grab bag of stupid voice overs overdone songs melodramatic romance undeveloped story and uneven acting only wish that could make that one hour and forty five minutes of my life re appear but alas it is lost in the spiritual world of interesting ideas gone wildly awry little known facts about this film and its stars this film is based on the novel written by alice hoffman co screenwriter akiva goldsman also wrote the screenplay for 1997 batman robin director griffin dunne is known mainly as an actor in such films as an american werewolf in london and after hours
there nothing new under the sun is phrase often used when the speaker actually means let find something to copy of course there are very few completely original ideas even earth shattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience there is after all no need to re invent the wheel time after time recently it seems that hollywood doesn feel the need to even re write the script my understanding of the word sequel is continuation of the story the film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of brian depalma adaptation of the steven king novel this is your dream come true rachel emily bergl high school outcast is beginning to notice weird things happening around her doors slam shut by themselves glass globes blow up her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent popular boy unexpectedly asks her out the in crowd conspires to embarrass her at public event any of this sound familiar once the audience catches on that this is the same story as carrie there little to do but wait for the inevitable ending the effects are bit better this time around but the film doesn work nearly as well there are couple of minor plot differences rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest and uh there must be other story changes but none stand out one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie now high school counselor she befriends rachel but her character potential is squandered there too much about sue that doesn make sense after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachel mother is in still living in the same small town the woman with well known history of mental problems is hired as high school counselor sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is genetic disease this may be the one original idea in the film but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as disease is never explained sue eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldn figure out what to do with her blink and you ll miss it some of the events are filmed in siyah and beyaz but the rationale for this is unknown it doesn add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random the rage retains some of the trappings of carrie without the meaning in the first film the color kirmizi was motif connected to carrie onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating here there an abundance of kirmizi but for no apparent purpose the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin one might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds the biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film and the flaws in this one

ready to rumble is not masterpiece in film have problem even regarding it as film it more of show big commercial for ted turner world championship wrestling wcw the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page goldberg and sting the story is very minimal and basic there are these two guys gordy david arquette and sean scott caan they are two twenty something wrestling fans from wyoming when they go to live event for the big match up there favorite wrestler jimmy king oliver platt is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus joe pantoliano gordy and sean decide to go on quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus plans on the way they meet some people have some fun and clean up some port potties sounds great huh well it not the movie makes many attempts at humor only few of them work the jokes that make you laugh however do not outnumber the film many duds there is funny repertoire between arquette and convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back especially enjoyed one version in which they have wrestling match and arquette tag team partner is macho man randy savage they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl the cheerleaders of the wcw she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face now what didn work in this movie that would be the rest of it the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets the two lead characters work for port potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck the excrements spill all over the road it not funny it pathetic and brainless the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way watch it for entertainment and would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle like that would happen to any fan especially to that stalk wrestler and sneak him back onto set also wondered how they got into the backstage so easily they just walked right in like wrestling watch it at home and laugh it continuously funny and has great characters otherwise wouldn watch it this movie wasn even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv the only fun had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers knew the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently the movie was too dim witted to be funny it is possibly the most useless and under developed film ever recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film detroit rock city that movie was interesting well done and continuously funny unlike this film the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh now that the scream trilogy is over arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be spokesman in those dumb 800 call att ads at least he has hot wife in courtney cox he in the funny parts of the film but there aren enough to make him look good the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock bawitdaba and cowboy martin landau has great cameo as classic hard nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne script is important to film but this piece of crap could have been made with couple of scribblings on napkin fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real the wrestlers form alliances go to people houses and beat them up it utterly ridiculous the whole film was wasteful dumfounding experience the movie was made to pay homage to the fans telling them things that made wrestling not the wrestlers the wrestlers are making more money to make movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying dollars to see potty humor movie the wcw sucks and this movie is just pathetic two hour commercial to watch it if you re going to watch wrestling watch wwf it actually entertaining the wrestling is betters they re funnier more diverse and have better entrance themes oh and the girls are hotter is this what movies have become hour long commercials that you have to pay to see don waste your money
wyatt earp details thirty five years in the life of same from around 1865 to 1900 after seeing the movie speed twice recently kept thinking that was seeing wyatt life pass before my eyes in real time this movie was boring slow boring and slow there were few scenes that tried to be great scenes that tried too hard and just fell flat the script happily woman bashes but also tries to sound like an 80s movie they cannot have it both ways now pronounce you husband and wife sure they said that in the 1800s entrepreneur sure every bit of male ego stroking dialogue that wyatt third wife speaks to him made me sick to listen to it oh the script was written by two men no kidding the movie is torture to sit through the scenery is boring the fades were either awkward or cliche or to self important can you say poor editing everyone looks ugly in this movie when you shoot people from under their chins they look like they have double chins kevin costner has never looked worse he should sue he looks like he gained the 43 pounds that dennis quaid lost dennis quaid is marvelous if you have to see this movie just for his performance go into the theatre at the movie halfway mark doc holliday quaid character shows up at about the 90 minute mark gene hackman is very good is he in the credits don remember seeing his name mare winningham makes the best of small role as wyatt second wife annabeth gish is good as wyatt first wife though that jamie gertz played wyatt third wife but later heard that her name is joanna going she looks great but her dialogue sucks she also seems way to young for costner costner seems way to old for 90% of this movie in his first scene he is supposed to be about 19 years old yeah right catherine hara and jobeth williams are always good and totally wasted here this is the worst movie that have seen in years the last action hero was better that this go see maverick if you want to see western bullets for dennis quaid performance only
steve martin is one of the funniest men alive if you can take that as true statement then your disappointment at this film will equal mine martin can be hilarious creating some of the best laugh out loud experiences that have ever taken place in movie theaters you won find any of them here the old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and wit bilko and the name isn an accident is the head of an army motor pool group but his passion is his schemes every episode involves the sergeant and his men in one or another hair brained plan to get rich quick while outwitting the officers of the base mchale navy granddaddy that the idea behind this movie too but the difference is that as far fetched and usually goofy as the television series was it was funny there is not one laugh in the film the re make retains the goofiness but not the entertainment everything is just too clean it was obviously made on hollywood back lot and looks every bit like it it all looks brand new even the old beat up stuff martin is remarkably small in what should have been bigger than life role in the original phil silvers played the huckster with heart of altin and more than touch of sleaziness martin bilko is pale imitation the only semi bright spot is phil hartman as bilko arch enemy it not saying much considering martin lackluster character but hartman leaves him in the dust
he doesn have hard to decipher accent he doesn always speak in monotone and his face doesn always wear the same impassive expression in short the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad but too bad to be good unfortunately the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle firestorm which is just plain awful one of the most glaring problems with long who made his acting debut in john woo broken arrow is that he so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery as ace firefighter jesse graves long is supposed to be playing bigger than life action hero the kind of he man who will crash through flaming door to save child or parachute into burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers unfortunately despite the best efforts of first time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner work in the postman look stark jesse turns out to be pretty boring good guy to put it kindly this is not well written motion picture firestorm is collection of howlingly bad lines set against backdrop of disaster movie clich which taken together form something that requires level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as plot the only reason this film is getting one star instead of something lower is that most of the fire sequences are realistic and was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively we re introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of forest fire to save group of people during this sequence our big burly hero proves that he also sensitive guy by risking his life to save little girl and her dog yes the dog lives from being broiled alive flash forward year now our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins real actor scott glenn but this day our big burly hero first in charge isn going to be business as usual group of nasty escaped criminals have set wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom led by randy earl shaye william forsythe the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border along the way they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress suzy amis eventually our big burly hero is placed in position where he has to fight the fire rescue the damsel in distress defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die and restore order to the galaxy firestorm director dean semler is former cinematographer he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves so it no surprise that the film looks good unfortunately that firestorm lone asset and it falters near the end when computer generated special effects fill up the screen these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on nintendo 64 video game the action sequences which include variety of chases are occasionally interesting but never invigorating everyone including long appears to be going through the motions there isn memorable performance to be found from beginning to end unless you count the forest fire which generates some heat as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die william forsythe lacks panache he worse than generic bad guy he boring generic bad guy who doesn have any snappy one liners to hurl at our big burly hero my advice to scott glenn absolute power and suzy amis titanic is to accidentally forget this film the next time they re making out resume there some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that already have one entry for my bottom 10 list at least hope there aren 10 worse films than this and know wasn the only one who really disliked this movie as the audience was filing out of the screening loitered in the theater lobby to catch few comments the general consensus seemed to be that although the movie sucked the promotional key ring was cool the problem is that fox won be giving out key rings to regular movie goers so that nixes any reason to see firestorm
in the first death wish movie mild mannered new york architect paul kersey played by charles bronson was avenging the death of his wife in the second he was avenging his daughter in the third he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend fourth movie on the other hand begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen played by kay lenz however since this is death wish movie we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for this time karen teenage daughter dies of crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways kersey new targets unlike the previous movies aren the ordinary street punks but rich heavily armed and well connected drug dealers even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support and it comes from the publisher nathan beyaz john ryan determined to avenge the drug related death of his own daughter white plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them the plan begins to take shape but kersey actions bring attention of two police detectives reiner george dickerson and nozaki soon teck oh fourth and unfortunately not the final installment in the death wish series will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade however although some critics might argue death wish the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish paul kersey one of the most intriguing and potentially controversial characters of the 1970s is still being dumbed down by mediocre script and charles bronson really doesn feel the need to put much effort in his acting however the hand of veteran director lee thompson seems more capable of michael winner and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring there are some attempts for the movie to have plot between the numerous scenes of violence and one of such attempts is potentially interesting plot twist at the end the script even tries to fake some social conscience through criminally underused kay lenz character and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years there are even some half hearted attempts of humour both intentional and unintentional like in scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by wine bottle but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronson 1970s classics special note to philes mith pilleggi the actor who plays ad skinner in the files could be seen in small role of cannery lab foreman

back in 1980s chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films he couldn of course top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot em up and beat em up genre aficionados that quantity was mostly provided by cannon group prolific production company that dominated the movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap formulaic and more often than not unwatchable genre products the hitman 1991 action thriller directed by chuck brother aaron is one of the last among them chuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed shot and left for dead by his partner which shouldn surprise anyone considering the fact that the partner is being played by michael parks specialised for roles of usually very mean characters surviving the shooting cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent he infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations italians french canadians and iranians since it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris at least not in this kind of movie the biggest attraction of this film should have been action well the action in this film falls flat it is boring repetitive and not at all exciting it is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films we know very little about norris character while on the other hand gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension in the end we almost feel sorry for them since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade during the film somebody obviously became aware of that problem so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the siyah boy who gets adopted by norris that caused another problem any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation the photography in this film is dark setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in watching it
as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding especially three times but alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber it amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything the whole point here is how could man be so blatantly forgetful this is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is professor well this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded along the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber thankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience the flubber is supposed to be flying rubber but it seems to have life of its own this is there strictly for the kids the properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs although amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone the poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at get his fiancee back finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire and do all this in the funniest way possible admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original the absent minded professor the whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable the basketball players stereotypically unqualified for the sport somehow manage to bounce fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning this just sounds too bad to be true the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film chance as for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie giving life to the flubber which is so poorly executed that it best forgotten and prof brainard flying robot weebo giving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasn for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in bit of music and extend the length of the movie the life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well but it wasn and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good now weebo is totally different story it robot that prof brainard created but forgot how and gave something of life too this is really original idea well maybe not but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie yes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters the film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all the acting by robin williams prof brainard seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced most of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to 12 people when stood up at the altar don usually give third chances or for that matter talk to the fiancee afterwards but what can be expected this is children movie flubber as movie does little original and is nothing special in any respect with the best character in the movie being something of prop doubt that many people will find it all that great it does have its amusing moments and it is good story in the end but it does not wash up to the original kids should find this movie amusing and fun and they ll probably enjoy the whole movie as movie it just kids movie and not the best of ones at that
well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you because thats all that there really is found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot for one thing beyaz leading actor who has siyah daughter does leave some curiosity am not saying that this isn possible but it does leave one to wonder know did another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out and certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations there was one scene that should have been short but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it found myself thinking ok enough already get on with it there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort another thing that noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning this movie is also very predictable you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at given moment granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you also some of the things that happen are little too predictable and several cliques are repeated it gets boring at times to tell you the truth even though there is still action going on another little point might add is that the main character is supposed to be quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero some of the characters are not proper for their roles the acting is fine but the characters just don seem to add up if was to base my review totally on the plot then wouldn rate this movie too highly but that just the thing this movie isn just the plot its the whole package and this package is really well done the whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really movie the special effects are just amazing you can tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live in few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just wouldn be able to say that the creature wasn there during filming extinct or not another thing is the destruction scenes wow those were masterpieces well some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dino make this one of the reasons to see this movie this movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office unfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments go see it in matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me one little side note although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid there were 10 theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock think that some people really want money badly and think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have chance you know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made thought put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick its not that bad movie but its not that great either hope you people realize this
when film is produced on shoestring budget by couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of genuine tragedy the easy path for reviewer who hated the movie is to give it pass toss out your usual objectivity ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it forget how unbearable it was to sit through and find some meaningless way to compliment it this of course will be of no service to your readers but at least you ll avoid the hate mail from the movie fans thus it is with heavy heart that review the movie paulina not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about talking parrot directed by vicky funari as labor of intense love she spent the last one third of her life on film the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez paulina was maid in vicky household when vicky was young got to learn the film background when attended screening in which the two women who made it were present for those without such context the reaction to the film may be that it is parody of bad indie film the acting is amateurish the story is maudlin and it has all the visual appeal of bad home movie grainy and overexposed the movie shot on 16mm film and videotape has little to recommend it confusingly composed the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story quite bloody at times the story full of horrific images seems designed to shock and repulse us why else would you include scene with completely nude and bloody year old paulina another scene has teenage paulina being fondled on bus by the man sitting next to her in retaliation she bites off part of his finger this covers the both of them in bucket of blood the passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner one for example sees her as an aztec priestess holding out large heart that she had just cut from body the lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten certainly she had to endure miserable life but that does not guarantee that movie about her will necessarily being good felt trapped in the theater watching it only the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable paulina runs 28 the film is in spanish with english subtitles it is not rated but would be an for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers
in gia angelina jolie plays the titular character the first so called supermodel and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome in my eyes anyway just don see how the life of model is worthy of two hour film despite this kept an open mind when began watching the movie sadly though my fears were realized it just not possible to make an interesting full length film about person who spends their days wearing different clothes the movie follows the rise and fall of gia no last name tumultuous woman who doesn particularly enjoy the world of fashion she becomes famous more quickly than she can handle and finds herself hooked on drugs and on woman she cannot have the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high losing job and going into rehab this formula is repeated several times and really got tired of it in general tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use no because it offends me or anything like that it just bores me quite frankly don see the appeal so when director shows me point of view shot of junkie complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices am left somewhat unimpressed the first hour of the film though was actually quite engaging we see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend these early scenes were interesting we re shown the fashion world through newcomers eyes and it was perspective hadn seen before the movie begins to go downhill however once gia becomes an established model >from that point lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end it all seemed so excessive fine so gia had drug problem does this really need to dominate the film couldn the same effect have been had with five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs or perhaps this film is meant to be warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world quite possibly although since have no desire to become model this warning is lost on me as stated at the beginning of this review simply don see how the life of model is worthy of feature length motion picture what do they do that warrants movie strut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players for example but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life gia did not and by the end of the film all knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling was bi sexual and was heavily into drugs not exactly meaningful contribution to society as far as concerned
the following review encompasses two versions of dune dune the theatrical version 1984 runtime 137 minutes capsule review cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives the theatrical version of dune is spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book the film visual splendour mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative dune the extended version 1988 runtime 189 minutes capsule review bit of throw together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television it was disowned by director david lynch but it considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline quality dubs of this version from the out of print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web the review released in 1984 and made on then mammoth budget of $40 million the film of frank herbert cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci fi fans director david lynch mavi velvet eraserhead twin peaks was working on his biggest production to date mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico the screenplay was lynch own chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected dune is set in universe ruled by powerful families overseen by successive line of emperors the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis dune windswept desert planet that home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it most importantly it allows the navigators of the spacing guild once human but now hideously mutated to fold space and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish lynch film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story two main strands one is the long standing rivalry between two families houses atreides and house harkonnen and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long awaited by the natives of arrakis the fremen the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom unfortunately this epic story unfolds in confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended the thinking among universal oh so wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office with lynch initial cut running at closer to three or more hours the studio demanded that further cuts be made what great idea why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible the most glaring consequence of this one eyed stupidity is hopelessly jumpy narrative leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters thus their personalities are vague their motivations unclear and in the case of paul father duke leto their demise rather meaningless the end result is distinct chill we can warm to most of the cast and we don care much for them and it hardly helps that the voice over narration is sparse and that the dune esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book dune is also very serous film the constant self talk by various characters makes it so serious and self absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment the overall impression is world full of people so intense that no one is allowed joke lest the universe come crashing down around them humour or at least gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen mad sadistic kind is hard to find you may balk at the comparison but as writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus star wars trilogy the theatrical version is still some way from being complete disaster however it still possesses enough of lynch stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with taste for imaginative sci fi special effects whiz carlo rambaldi giant sandworms are an awesome sight both the production design anthony masters and costume design bob ringwood are striking and original and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis lush cinematography the film is at least feast for the senses see it in the widescreen format if you can and despite all the cuts several cast members still make strong impression most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam leader of the bene gesserit religious order who secret aim is to manipulate paul destiny for its own shadowy ends as paul atreides the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as credible leader of the fremen crusade the conclusion any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert original novel is complex piece of work and presents tough challenge for any filmmaker david lynch took brave stab at it and partly due to forces beyond his control ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects dune certainly confused and frustrated lot of people on its release many chose to stay away altogether as the film disastrous box office showing attests the extended version however is rather different beast in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition director cut of the film on home video clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres but alas he failed to do so choosing to move on to other projects in way then it is partly lynch own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa stung into action lynch successfully petitioned the director guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with allen smithee the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous judas booth certainly looking at the results of mca handiwork there at least half dozen instances that for sheer technical sloppiness are good enough reasons for the director to object but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration both of which fill many holes in the original version storyline paul relationship with his father and associates is more intimate with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously the political skulduggery involving the emperor the spacing guild the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained paul initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably and as further background new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us brief history of the dune universe as piece of storytelling then mca tv version of dune is clearly superior as piece of editing however it is at times surprisingly inept the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate there some sloppy cutting too and in few instances shots even appear out of order and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes eg ships coming and going soldiers coming and going is at times clearly out of context this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected and rightly so it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of television but the most notable omission is gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn even in herbert book the scene features baron harkonnen killing beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his heart plug its surreal and disturbing episode that very lynch esque but adds nothing to what we already know the baron is nasty piece of work despite its own peculiar flaws then the extended version of dune is generally superior film all up it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered fabricated or newly created sequences unless the idiosyncratic lynch has sudden change of heart the alan smithee version remains the closest we ll get to what the movie should have been on repeated viewings one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit still as one of this century great science fiction novels some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved better fate in its transfer to the screen with rumours circulating of new six hour mini series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga
battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 and guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close in fact ll be surprised if see anything this bad in the next ten years based on the novel by scientology guru ron hubbard battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information it the year 3000 and an alien race called the psychlos which sounds like tag team of mexican wrestlers conquered our planet in nine minutes ok we are all of 10 seconds in and have zillion questions racing through my mind when were we conquered the audience is led to believe that this happened about 000 years earlier and if that is the case then we re going to get into whole bunch of problems later trust me keep reading also why don we get to see earth get conquered how the hell do you make popcorn sci fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film humans now live as cavemen or slave labor and for the film first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver colorado they grunt and groan and babble about monsters so when the psychlos conquered earth were the only humans not captured herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered whenever that was this is definitely not the way to start an action sci fi film one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is monster and he begins to fight it the monster turns out to be dinosaur from an old miniature golf course he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course with some shrubs growing over them so in 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time with only few weeds growing over it anyway some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl john travolta smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing recently discovered altin deposit the cavemen led by barry pepper are forced to do their bidding or whatever but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet or something so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 000 years earlier and we re supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by group of buffoonish aliens who can even handle few cavemen one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos so jets left unattended for 000 years are still able to fly please if leave my car unattended for two weeks have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway shouldn they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us the psychlos refer to humans as man animals but yet dogs are still dogs why aren they dog animals the psychlos are after mining earth precious resources but for 000 years are unaware of fort knox why do even care at this point fan of travolta and glad to see he back on the list in hollywood despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon but how did he possibly think this was good movie and how did he think he was giving good performance here he more than capable of making menacing villain see broken arrow and face off but whenever his character came on screen couldn hold back my laughter now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have travolta just looks like travolta all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face but travolta just has goatee also travolta acts with sort of phony upper class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world ooooo scary villain as producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better you can make dumb but good sci fi film love independence day for example but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth did everything possibly could to stay awake during the screening cleaned my glasses walked around the theater made grocery list chose my lottery numbers for the week replayed super bowl xxv in my head with commercials and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids by the time we actually reach the year 3000 people should still be avoiding this film folks save your cash don go see it don rent it and don buy it you be more entertained by taking the money you use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind watching it sail away hell send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal we ll entertain you plenty with that kind of money unless of course you re just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running which is just about all you ll come away with from this movie that and headache [editor note for some reason though the day after my screening converted to scientology not sure why something just made me feel compelled make the choice
my friend here in film school just made two minute long film for one of his classes that includes staged anal rape scene done by two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident with banana being used as the instrument of penetration as sick as this all is watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments ve ever witnessed sure it may be in bad taste but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest then there caligula this film features incest necrophilia beastuality anal rape homosexual felatio of both sexes elaborate and lengthy orgies greased up fist forced up man rear wine poured down man who had his urinary tracts tied off penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs etc etc etc this could very well be respectable film and if could have been had the following not occurred the events were graphically shot in clear view the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to well show historical accuracy the film was 20 million dollar production with lavish sets rather impressive cast and whopping hour running time produced and funded by none other than bob guccione owner of penthouse magazine caligula comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since plan from outer space because underneath there sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified but also brilliantly entertaining after all it not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry no film should be discarded because its content because film is never about what it about it about how it about as the old cliche goes those who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with caligula and that that it nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish without second of credibility in its mammoth running time caligula allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as blessing or so guess even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons the film opens on the wrong note of course with quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen using the over used passage what shall it profit man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer fucking around with his own sister in field suppose if one has to lose their soul one has to have soul in the first place the plot is so incomprehensibly done that all or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell performance that does the opposite that his performance in clockwork orange did is next in line for the throne but can wait for the current emporer tiberius peter toole ditto only for his performance in lawrence of arabia his grandfather to die so he kills him and ascends to the throne then he abuses his position marries woman helen mirren who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting so he doesn just have to sleep with his sister dreadful teresa ann savoy there to be pretty naked and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with abuses his position little more little more and little more and then believe invades england then is killed off the filler instead of recounting his life is supposed to be as guccione claims the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome complete with orgies vicious deaths and lots of nudity but instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be it instead becomes guccione twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like oh isn it great that they just loved having sex and that they killed people so disgustingly and wouldn it be great if could make couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it so blatantly real bad porn that ve completely convinced myself that it not mean why not just show roman orgy when can spend good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up and it not just that it disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film it that in film where the entire feel it going for isn felt it also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time the sets are lavish but so blatantly innacurate that wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this but that doesn matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if light meter was used at all making this not only dark and ugly but just plain dark the camera operation is also the worst ve ever seen in my entire life not only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them then have them out of focus the editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow there is no writer to speak of what the hell does it mean that it adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal but nevertheless the dialogue is shit so laughably bad that can in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over could say them with straight face my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius he could go at any moment but with care he could last year or so the music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian they use his gorgeous adagio of spartacus and phrygia ad nauseum used in an attempt to give the film some emotion but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere the orgy scenes and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo are the result of reshoots by guccione himself which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment every five seconds or so the film cuts to random nudity as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated john gielgud represents the only voice of sanity walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra going to kill my agent going to kill my agent and so on and so on for over hours making caligula about as exciting and enriching as three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying guccione in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made film that is such painstaking arduous task to watch in its entirety that doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage throughout the entire film the presence of guccione is easily felt as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen pretentiously looking down upon us saying look what can get away with and if you don like this then you re prig and worse than that you know nothing about history uh huh there clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that artistically good film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last that would probably make for good film but using historical accuracy as licence to get away with any kind of disgusting for disgustingness sake acts is total total bullshit and all can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism and have developed pathetic and sadistic taste for both judging from this film there film that came out in 1989 called the cook the thief his wife and her lover magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway also starring helen mirren which deals with graphic sex heartstopping violence and gore and even little cannibalism for good measure that film not only never patronized its viewers but also handled them in way that was shocking yes but also in bizarre way entertaining and totally involving there were real characters there in real situation and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that it going to be offensive to many that film achieved everything it wanted to do and has since retained status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good and it everything caligula might have been but alas wasn
be warned the following review contains some harsh language the blair witch project quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy my colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more and this worked for him well sorry but nothing is nothing nothing is not more it nothiiiiiinggggggggggg do not pay dollars to see nothing nothing is free available all around the world at location near you am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary could just discount them and say well guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow but have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn hold water there must be some other reason then again maybe my first thought is correct think ll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction when hear people praising this film never hear them talking about what makes up about 97% of this movie three kids bickering with each other about being lost they only talk about what might make up possibly to minutes of screen time this being few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout josh over and over this film should not be called the blair witch project it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost and argue with each other oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting josh and if you thought that was scary wait till you see pile of rocks and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear oh yeah and some goo on one of their backpacks you ve never seen terror like this folks and you don want to the chevy chase goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film for current films highly recommend the sixth sense or stir of echoes for creepy filmgoing experience this film is an example of marketing with no substance the marketing was brilliant and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film they want this film to be good and think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don have anything else to praise that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along but this is not it this film could have been so much better just think if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff saw this movie with girl who was extremely pumped for it she was sold on this film and then at one point during it she turned to me and asked are we supposed to be scared by this ve heard one opinion that you have to use your imagination to create the fear in this movie well thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do use their imagination and create good movie mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay bucks for it but even if you like this idea then what are you imagining an entity called the blair witch some rednecks fucking with these kids are either of these things really scary when you think about it ve heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something well sure thats scary in real life but there are lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in movie nor even interesting you could sit in your house and see snake or spider and it could be scary but in film it wouldn be and no movie does not need big budget or cgi special effects to be scary or creepy actually the less the better see the equally awful remake of the haunting but you have to do something you cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary if it were real and by the way about the shakycam filming in blair witch aren these supposed to be filmmakers who should know how to point camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified that justified talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they can seem to shoot anything smoothly at all minor quibble there there is feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers that the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank and think there is good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves what was thinking but if they don then thats fine if it works for them then that okay guess just lament that by making this movie hit we are going to be subjected to more of the nothing is more approach pretty soon we re going to get some movies like this just still shot of prison jail cell for 90 minutes and we ll have to use our imagination and think to ourselves my god wouldn it be scary to spend life in prison this movie is the scariest movie of all time or shot of coffin with some funeral directors arguing with each other man do you know how scary it would be to die now this is the scariest movie of all time [r]
if you ve been following william fichtner career and there absolutely no reason why you should have you might have noticed that he played some rather similar roles over the years like sully in the perfect storm tough gruff and little bit scary or law in albino alligator tough gruff and little bit scarier or colonel william sharp in armageddon or dwayne engelman in strange days or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of pearl harbor as the abusive father of danny here is an actor who gravitates towards tough gruff hard hitting roles which is why his performance in what the worst that could happen is such shock such delight in the film fichtner plays blonde haired meticulously dressed overtly effeminate dog loving detective as alex tardio fichtner performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it it borders on offensive but doesn really manage it and it borders on clich stereotype but doesn quite succumb to that definition either in role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming fichtner isn perfect you can see him struggling little at times concentrating little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air or nuzzles coiffed canine up close and personal but he pretty damned good and silly and without question the best thing in the film in fact had it not been for fitchner sudden and bizarre appearance and his jarring screen presence thereafter would have walked out for what the worst that could happen is mesmerizing in its awfulness poorly written haphazardly edited and totally unfunny yes it stars martin lawrence and danny devito so how could that be possible moviegoing experience fichtner performance doesn exactly save the film and it not like recommending what the worst that could happen solely on the strength of the actor dramatic turnaround but his contributions do raise the film rating from no stars to one and half thumbs up to fichtner then and thumbs down way way down to everyone else involved in this sorry mess movie so dull and pedestrian and nonsensical it doesn even warrant discussion
for his directoral debut gary oldman chose highly personal family drama about violent alcoholic husband and father and the various lives he affects but while the characters places and events may have special meaning to the writer director the audience is left in the dark the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ray winstone and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars then he returns home to his pregnant wife valerie kathy burke and their five year old daughter raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies and his paranoid delusions early on when he accuses valerie brother billy charlie creed miles of stealing raymond then proceed to beat and bite him to bloody wreck but these are the least of billy problems billy is heroin addict on the downturn and it doesn seem that he ll last much longer billy and valerie mother janet laila morse is raymond nemesis she disapproves of him and he of her but is powerless to do anything about it she merely struggles on hoping her children will survive their respective torments if this description seems bleak haven told the half of it this is not cheery movie and most of the time it downright depressing while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him in the end it not quite worth it there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose take for example the extended sequence where one of billy scuzzy friends defends stray puppy the film is filled with these character moments that never really achieve anything granted there are few genuinely powerful and sickening moments in the film but their expression seems to be more of catharsis for the creator than us the actors do fine job particularly in the central roles the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into the bad thing about an actor turned director is that there no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience oldman got it about half right
pre review note seeing as the only concern of body shots is sex will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review because of this will try to vary word descriptions of sex meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms and or your name is jerry falwell you are kindly invited to hit the up on the left corner of your screen so if there happens to be word you come across and cannot comprehend fret not it most likely just another way of referring to sex think we all agree that any word used incessantly becomes bit monotonous so hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be very boring review though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what body shots is film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously in the way you normally expect to see violent attack it about people who think about screwing seek it out and talk about it these are things we all do sometimes the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts their lives center around the next sexual encounter but they seemed depressed it as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after busy workweek at its core body shots is message movie the kind of thing could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition michael cristoffer who directed gia another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil is moralist with nothing new to say his characters don communicate anything of interest to each other so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera they voice simplistic platitudes like like to come or sex without love equals violence huh and yes that is as complex as this movie observations get the characters are stupid and shallow with not one registering as anything more the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure then the after math the morning after of such events we meet the characters as they speak directly to us confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them giving you the pros and cons but for this film cannot not trying to be clever or witty but honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others with the exception of trent played by ron livingston as bargain basement patrick bateman the rest fade into each other patchwork of fake breasts defined abs pearly beyaz teeth and creamy flawless skin vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one only because his character gets the worst lines sex without love equals violence in between all the confessionals cristoffer films everything like headache commercial with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning the fact that this director at one point won pulitzer prize completely baffles me this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and obsessed fine don have any problem with film that tries to persuade me to think certain way but cristoffer only gives us one side additionally that one side isn even entertaining the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness or realism one sexual encounter takes place outside club on chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other alas if it could only be that easy kidding of course then not only isn it erotic it isn real it doesn feel like an authentic sexual encounter every scene in this film and there are many is treated in the same unsexy manner body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it and most of all it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it the resulting search for nookie and you can take that cookie over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow the main concern is much ado over rape that may or may not have occurred the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape one where it is consensual the other where it is not and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off this is topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently and if memory serves me can think of one film that has done so and yes saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80 next to wall street unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care not the writer the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of noxious 90210 spin off paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in manner similar to what cristoffer does here though boogie nights succeeded it was similarly moralistic but it gave us two different viewpoints it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters and it showed us the possible fall out of such decision the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here but anderson seemed to care about them he gave them heart cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones he preaches to us by using his characters to preach to us this is not the way to get any message across why not just direct public service announcement on the perils of hittin skins cristofer kind of does that though without an ounce of insight and with helping of leering exploitation
wonder if budget is at all criterion for whether or not movie can be considered an exploitation flick take the professional for example it boasts extremely glossy cinematography couple of recognizable name actors and couple of fairly impressive explosions it also basically about violence and cheap titilation and features central relationship between middle aged man and twelve year old girl with decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension the professional is all over the map and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant the professional of the title is new york hit man named leon jean reno brutally efficient but also very isolated one day he is forced to let someone into his life when girl from his apartment building knocks on his door her name is matilda natalie portman and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired agent norman stansfield gary oldman after matilda father tried to rip him off leon reluctantly takes matilda in then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother the two become closer which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much and sets out to eliminate them both writer director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita slick potboiler about female assassin there is no question that besson can make great looking film with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast he has created film chock full of moody close ups and evocative lighting but beneath the shiny wrapper there isn nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given character to develop leon is mostly collection of quirky traits all intended to show us that for hired killer he really not so bad guy he drinks lots of milk takes meticulous care of potted plant and enjoys gene kelly movies jean reno succeeds at giving leon haunted and desperate quality but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda natalie portman is all wrong for part that called for much grittier quality but she doesn have too much to work with either besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place as is scene where matilda shocks hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover character is thoroughly sacrificed for cheap gag gary oldman entire part is something of cheap gag wild eyed and way over the top but at least he is interesting to watch there isn real person to be found anywhere in the professional which isn always problem in an action thriller except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of twelve year old in really distasteful way there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda relationship confront it head on or ignore it entirely but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he going to show them forbidden love story while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching child to load 9mm pistol or the blood which is spilled aplenty great deal of the time the professional is just plain sleazy and all the soft filters in the world can disguise that fact
return to horror high wants to be couple different types of movies at once the film tells the story of low budget horror movie being filmed at the closed down crippen high school where group of serial murders took place five years before but what the cast and crew don know is that real killer maybe the same one that was never apprehended is going into action again on one level return to horror high is slasher movie and it is at this level that it works the best on watching the film which was made in 1987 couldn help but take notice that the killer costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in scream and scream on another level the film wants to be slapstick comedy and there are many hints of this throughout unfortunately most of these jokes fall flat and the last thing the film wants to be is behind the scenes look at an exploitation film being made the only problem is that while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made no cameras are shown filming it thus making it far more confusing than it had to be and to top it all off the twist ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous and plot holes you could drive winnebago through if you see the film or have seen it you ll know what mean the premise of return to horror high is admittedly pretty crafty and liked the atmosphere of the school which is where the whole thing takes place but director froehlich judging from this movie is an incompetent director except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene well come to think of it there is only one scene that is actually scary and it has to do with two actors being locked in room as the killer tries to break in but other than that two minute distraction return to horror high is certainly no great shake note look for george clooney in supporting role as one of the actors on the film and strangely enough he is the first character to get the ax literally

went to blair witch project book of shadows with the highest of hopes the original film released last summer was genuinely scary and terrifying hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor unfortunately my hopes were soon dashed as the movie opens the audience is shown pseudo documentary clips of burkittsville maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as result of the original blair witch project movie it mostly humorous self aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film during this segment we are introduced to the protagonist young man who sells blair witch related memorabilia from his website the movie then cuts to title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia but now he is confined in mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies we see him having some sort of disgusting beyaz goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while cigarette smoking doctor luridly leers above him we see him throwing himself wildly around padded room we see him cowering naked in shower stall as fire hose is turned on him no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution in fact these scenes are barely referred to again had sinking feeling during these opening scenes generally hospital scene that is set with poor lighting filthy interiors and evil doctors is sure sign that you are in the throes of truly horrible movie the movie cuts again this time to the present the young man whose name is jeffrey played by jeffrey donovan as in the first movie the character names are identical to the actors names although this movie admits up front that it is fictional so there no reason for the practice this time around is rounding up group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the blair witch hunt which is promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website we meet tristen and steven young couple who are writing book about the blair witch experience steven is skeptic believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria tristen on the other hand believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence she is wan and soft spoken she complains that the radio is playing too loudly she also complains that she feels nauseated knew immediately that the character was pregnant and my intuition was confirmed few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out how did know because in bad movies nauseated women are always pregnant the fourth member of their party is erica wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was good witch not evil they pick up the fifth and final team member in cemetery kim is dressed completely in siyah has extreme goth style makeup on and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect it never explained the party of five heads off into the woods as promised they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr house and set up camp complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night events there is brief encounter with rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well but after few words are exchanged the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere the movie veers off at this point to spend many long long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down sexual innuendoes are tossed around much hard liquor beer and pot is consumed and nothing much else happens this would be great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary the next day the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed and that steven and tristen manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds like snow the videotapes are missing but thanks to psychic intuition from kim they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house right where the original blair witch tapes were found ooh spooky the team goes back to jeffrey house creepy old civil war era warehouse in the heart of the woods to regroup and review the tapes they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night wacky hijinks ensue tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch everybody starts finding these weird rune like burn marks on their bodies steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations and everything pretty much goes to hell in handbasket throughout the entire ordeal jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps eventually tristen wanders in mutters something about reverse and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards when they do this they discover what really happened during the five lost hours one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes okay if the videotapes were being buried then how were they recording themselves oh nevermind this movie was awful simply awful the characters are broadly drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development erica is the nature loving wiccan tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman steven is the overbearing asshole kim is the antisocial goth girl old tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic because she pregnant how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl because she wears lot of eye makeup how do we know the local sheriff is bad guy because he has jagged teeth and talks like he straight out of deliverance this is weak storytelling at its worst rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic the writer chose to give each one few stereotypical characteristics in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action it didn work on top of being poorly developed most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid honey you just had miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at hospital that looks like it belongs in bad slasher movie let get on plane home no am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and want to find out what going on ok frankly by the end of the movie was rooting for the witch also felt that there was simply too much blood gore in this film the first movie worked by never showing us the horror the witch was palpable presence in that movie but we never saw it we never saw anything in fact the horror was all off screen and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be this is the hallmark of truly creepy and disturbing horror movie blair witch dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross out this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing beyaz goo down jeffrey throat and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be ritual massacre of some sort knives plunge into flesh bloody fingers trail off into the darkness and none of it is explained until the very end when it was too late for me to care this movie didn stop with showing us the gore either it went for broke and showed us everything by the end of the movie there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours it is all explained in fact it is all shown on screen in loving detail confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster or see only brief glimpses mere suggestions of what the monster is it is not because find the monster so terrifying but because find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no monster that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind found this to be miserably poor explanation if it was in fact the director intent then he needs to have some words with the writer because it was not made clear at all know lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds none of them has ever gone on murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with group of other people for the next week or so and if there was no witch then what about the vanishing tree the snowfall of manuscript paper hm blair witch book of shadows was horrible movie from the poorly written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross out shots it was bad effort through and through
okay okay maybe wasn in the mood to watch mindless action movie am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii even while admitting that it wasn as good as the others howewer the latest segal picture didn look that bad and since none of my friends would go see woody allen movie even if paid them went to see it expecting mild die hard rehash boy was wrong in the first half of the movie we are already assaulted with segal acting he is not simply wooden he is like wall gratuitous violence an incredible plot sexist and even more gratuitous nudity and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes by the end it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense of course in movies like these there must be sidekick and love interest in these one we are given two for one package in the form of playboy model in the movie which only functions as supposed comic relief by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie oh of course she appears naked from the waist up and of course segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship they did not even seem to be interested in each other have never seen so little chemistry between two people in movie often the villain saves the movie unfortunately the villains here are cartoonish stupid and unfunny unmenacing how many movies have psycho ex special forces bad guys too many was able to predict the action all throughout the movie including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him the scene where we are shown the hero superiors are stupid the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand etc simply said this is movie making by the numbers boring and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience my recommendation if you go see it bring watch you ll be looking at it for most of the movie my rent die hard read book stare at the sky do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid the real sad thing is that there are lot of movies out that would rather have seen once again dragged in by my friends which by the way liked the movie halfheartedly they probably like wrestling too
there may not be critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as do delighted in the sneaky smart entertainment of ron underwood big underground worm yarn tremors even giggled at last year critically savaged big underwater snake yarn anaconda something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth spent in the company of ghidrah the creature from the siyah lagoon and the blob deep rising big undersea serpent yarn doesn quite pass the test sure enough all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place conspicuously multi ethnic multi national collection of bait excuse me characters an isolated location here derelict cruise ship in the south china sea some comic relief few cgi enhanced gross outs and at least one big explosion there are too cheesy to be accidental elements like sleazy shipping magnate anthony heald who also appears to have doctorate in marine biology or slinky international jewel thief famke janssen whose beyaz cotton tank top hides heart of altin as it happens deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients terrorist crew led by squinty eyed mercenary hanover wes studi and piloted by squinty eyed boat captain finnegan treat williams shows up to loot the cruise ship the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew few survivors make it to the closing credits and up go the lights it hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film making especially when monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream here the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin connor generally amusing as the crew fraidy cat mechanic writer director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating tone of action horror menace something over populated with gore drenched skeletons something where the gunfire and special effects are taken bit too seriously deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we re expected to have ridiculous good time not hide our eyes case it point comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda in deep rising one of the creature victims is regurgitated back into view partially digested and still alive he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain in moment bit too disturbing to be laughable in anaconda we also see regurgitated victim partially digested and still alive he looks at another character and winks make no mistake deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing it also gloomy uninspired and not nearly enough fun don ask much of my monster movies but do ask that they act like monster movies you don have to show me fantastically impressive massive beast with tentacles flailing just show me the massive beast burping and ll figure you get the point
teenagers have lot of power in hollywood every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights wallets in hand the formula is very simple you make film with big name young actor or actress with sex appeal you add high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds and then very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes the typical teenage attention span the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any film set in an environment they can relate to and most importantly they don92t care to judge films=92 quality so any piece of trash will due that is just what never been kissed the latest film from director raja gosnell is trash josie geller drew barrymore is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times she has her own personal assistant unlimited supplies and her own office but she is very much dismayed with her position in life there is nothing she wants more than to be reporter and go out into the field where she can play more active role in the chicago media so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere she jumps at it with elation constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita molly shannon and her amicable superior gus john reilly the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment as they both deem her to be an office worker and not reporter however since this film is aimed at teenage audience with little patience for character conflict this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes and josie is headed for the field obviously the field assignment involves high school specifically she is to become an undercover reporter at high school by enrolling in the senior class and becoming one of them don92t think that need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring so won92t the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of dork she truly was and she appears to be heading down that road again fortunately for this lame production other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting they include the predictable love stories between both student jeremy jordan and teacher michael vartan to show that josie is really two people in one body also her younger brother and opposite rob david arquette comes into her new found life and even causes rare scene that is mildly provocative the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing typical for teenage films it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor one scene in particular features certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy but those still don92t recover for the total lack of quality in this movie following this trend of high school movie rules comes the general acting it is even worse than the trend of overplaying scenario from film to film in this case drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch she is required to play her character on two levels having some very siyah and beyaz transitions and although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on ferris wheel and is expected to him on an adult level since he is one her teacher but she never seems to get out of the gray area and in doing so she makes mockery out of his otherwise good performance following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon saturday night live she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic it is these qualities that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film david arquette scream takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic and not have his brilliant acting ruined and as central character he gets to take on his own mini plot which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed in dazzling cherry on the sundae type piece of work he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit risky business never been kissed is mediocre film at best the predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood that it is sickening to watch time and again and this film is no exception the acting is just as bad but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light unfortunately the bottom line is that the movie will be success because teenagers will pay to see any trash

susan granger review of the musketeer universal pictures hollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this $50 million adaptation of alexandre dumas novel that strong on action but weak on drama fusing hong kong martial arts with 17th century swordplay the story chronicles the adventures of the dashing artagnan justin chambers as he leaves his village of gascogne headed for paris to join king louis xiii elite guard the royal musketeers and to search for the man who killed his parents 14 years earlier this puts him in conflict with the formidable febre tim roth vicious henchman for conniving cardinal richelieu stephen rea the traditional musketeer trio aramis nick moran athos jan gregor kremp and porthos steve speirs don offer much help so he turns to the feisty francesca mena suvari chambermaid to the queen of france catherine deneuve scripter gene quintano and director cinematographer peter hyams are primarily interested in the derring do as evidenced by choreographer xin xin xiong elaborate but not original stunts including fast paced stagecoach chase tavern brawl on rolling barrels high wire acrobatics with the combatants dangling from ropes and ladder fight sequence filmed in southern france the scenery sets and costumes are spectacular but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy restless mtv ish cuts as the swashbuckling artagnan bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing totally lacking on screen charisma not to mention acting skill mena suvari so impressive in american beauty seems like contemporary interloper in the royal court on the granger movie gauge of to 10 the musketeer is cinematic but shallow all for one and one for all not this time round
_soldier_ is hands down one of the worst movies person could ever have to sit through that doesn have jean claude van damme in it could liken it to the sci fi cheese that was the hollywood product of choice back in the early 80s but that would be too much of compliment if there is movie theater in hell this film is playing there 24 hours day the story such that there is revolves around todd kurt russell an automaton of man who has been raised from birth to be merciless soldier in not too distant ultra conservative future is there any other kind after years of desensitization at military academy full of other boys just like him todd becomes ground fighter in series of wars all over the galaxy who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesn matter because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash yes folks there more we see todd as buff scarred adult now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break sweat there new wrinkle though todd and his brethren are declared obsolete and new batch of soldiers takes their place after losing sanctioned battle with _dragon_ jason scott lee the seemingly dead todd is dumped by flying ice cube tray well that what is looked like on remote garbage planet if you predict that todd meets bunch of outcast settlers on this planet and that they band together to fight bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them you re way ahead of the game the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half expect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute it surprising that _soldier_ is the brain child of _blade runner_ co writer david webb peoples unlike that mind twisting classic this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three double spaced pages add into the mix the _mortal kombat_ paul anderson inept direction and it easy to see how _soldier_ turned out so bad and the special effects remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars gary busey is in this movie nuff said _soldier_ is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all now if you ll excuse me have to go weep for the future
this movie stinks although it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss knew was in for trouble when during the opening establishment shots we see detailed close up of warrant officer paul brenner john travolta military identification card and it is the wrong color this might seem like minor detail but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow and what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is recruit on his first day of training or what about when brenner tells suspect that because he is in the military he doesn have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision how hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts now details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through for example at the beginning of the film paul brenner an undercover army investigator gets into gun and knife battle at his off post houseboat and winds up killing an arms dealer he had been investigating the local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing but instead of arresting him or at least take him into custody for further questioning they release him duh ultimately brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding general daughter young captain also assigned to the post when brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the general daughter does he use them to generate suspect list and begin grilling suspects no his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing eventually brenner discovers that this murder is related to violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier won even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the army suppression of this horrendous crime will just mention one final flaw brenner is investigating crime that occurred in georgia the rape occurred in west point which is in new york he is under very tight and totally implausible 36 hour deadline to solve this case he needs to discuss the rape with psychiatrist at west point does he phone the doctor no he travels via some unexplained very fast transport to new york to question the psychiatrist in person and then he returns to georgia again by the miracle transport without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline you have been warned stay away from this one
`bats is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan to pull something like this off you need to have sense of wit and style with heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines something like the underground worm thriller `tremors had just the perfect mixture of these elements and in return the film was tremendous fun with the notable exception of wisecracking supporting player `bats mainly plays it premise for straight arrow horror judging by the ridiculous premise this was not exactly wise move the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock `the birds but fails miserably done right it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema unfortunately `bats is prime example of formula movie done terribly terribly wrong the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be will recite the following paragraph in manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats is aimed toward those guys in hollywood have made movie about bats these bats are not very nice because they eat lot of people boy are these bats ugly they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super duper smart they ve got big claws and kirmizi eyes and they are not very friendly at all whole bunch of people in texas get killed so sheriff guy and scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with but the bats are pretty smart so it sorta hard to do the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good but no `bats is probably too violent for pre schoolers the film directed by louis morneau should have ventured straight into video stores on the small screen perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward although at few moments it becomes guilty pleasure the film is poorly written poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude even the bats themselves are cheesy and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey lou diamond phillips who embodies every pathetic stereotype small town authority figure usually portrays he chomps on cigar struts contentedly in his boots etc the scientist is dr sheila casper dina meyer who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her field meyer uses lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable but everything about dr casper is recycled beyond recognition her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `jaws everything revolving around `bats is tired drivel which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw with voices dubbed in later in fact that may have worked out better in the end take one glance at casper bat loathing sidekick jimmy leon and you ll have immediate deja vu he the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie constructed specifically for timed comic relief unfortunately none of his comic interludes are funny in the role of deranged mad scientist dr mccabe the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch mccabe `accidentally released two experimental test subjects and the virus spread to other bats the entire town of gallup texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else something like `when is the damn movie going to be over just want my money the bats are ugly must say there the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing but mainly the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been but by the absurdly stupid climax it way too late in the game for decent recovery characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire let explore the logic there is this really very efficient way to decrease the bat population you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one and after that there are only 18 000 more of them this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind `bats
capsule combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark dash of jackie chan movie sans jackie two teaspoons of gun and swordplay and dollop of cgi simmer for 100 minutes yields zilch the phantom is depressing and tired retread of so many earlier better movies that after the fifteen minute mark started cataloguing them out loud it hard to make good action adventure movie that doesn simply recycle its predecessors and ve seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully the phantom allegedly based on the long running comic of the same name doesn even bother to be graceful it stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list but ll try the film opens up with prelude sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given heavy voice over to compensate for whatever got thrown out we go from there to jungle sequence that swear to god recycles the truck chase scene from raiders of the lost ark note for note possibly even shot for shot right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush and then goes on to rip off the rope bridge scene from sorcerer as well sorcerer as you may well remember was remake of french movie the wages of fear in which bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain both versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick but ve got my job to do so back to the salt mines we go anyway the cinematic theft doesn stop there or at least the lack of inspiration there isn single thing here we haven seen and it not given to us in way that remotely evokes our interest we have where my list bad girl tough good girl secret cave hideaway which seems inspired more by dr no than anything else boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality magical artifacts of terrible power and cary hiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear fu manchu mustache and sneer lot and generally humiliate himself what else is there the plot is waste of time the sets alternate between big but hokey and tiny and still hokey there are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked and sure once mike and the bots get the cash they ll stick it on their sked the only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane he good actor and he tries very hard even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of scene after another all can say is that pray this isn the beginning of the end for him although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comic book super hero movie
in the continuation of warner brother franchise joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow what makes this film such grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film avika goldsman screenplay is such cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another this coming on the heals of such marvelously written project as the client is such shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was fluke situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone batgirl who just happens to be alfred niece the story of dr victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought while working on cure for tragic decease contracted by his wife dr freeze is injured during cryogenic procedure and becomes man who can only survive in sub zero environment now of course he has become terrorist intent on turning the world into frozen planet where only he can live now the logic of that little sub plot escapes me if mr freeze wanted to find cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death why would he want to have her live in world with no warmth this is indeed cold hearted man the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory she wants to breed form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal she joins with mr freeze in his plan to start new ice age destroying all animal life therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them the characters have no logic batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward robin bruce wayne is trying to be father figure constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships while at the same time not really having any george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him to say that his performance is workman like is to be generous his best performances are still on bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend played by elle macpherson that it brings into question bruce latent homosexuality there is no spark and no passion as there was for nicole kidman psychologist in batman forever between bruce and anyone other than alfred and even that relationship is very reserved robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series now he just spoiled kid in batman forever burt ward wanted to be batman partner and friend now robin is suffering from ego deficiency robin attraction for poison ivy is not believable except for boy around the age of 15 his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest even though they are not related in traditional sense chris donnell once considered rising star successfully burns up on reentry with this performance his robin needs nothing more than good spanking the less said about alicia silverstone performance the better this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of dubbing actor for godzilla film she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it this brings us to the villains arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday the most rediculous scene is during mr freeze imprisonment the guards are at least foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film it almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as gang member umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part showing growing discomfort with her sex symbol status her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in sextette 1978 the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film without going through the intricacies of the plot there is one question that always comes to mind with this series except for the first batman and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel mr freeze is introduced with team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video every villain even the minor ones have to have look no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume with this film warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to it tv incarnation the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows gwaaaa and clang associated with the old series you almost wonder if william dozier producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film the special effects by john dykstra and production design by barbara ling are the primary stars of this film and it is case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing every set from ivy lair the batcave to freeze hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film everything is set for maximum exposure the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on the time machine the growing plant scene but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series master shots pepper the action scenes destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had mr schumacher is good director one just has to look back on the films the lost boys cousins an underrated film and the client to know that but batman and robin comes off as mated made for tv movie the film has no style of individuality it is the cinematic equivalent to jell pretty to look at but empty it is unfortunate that this film even with it surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warner thought tim burton would do with the franchise kill it joel schumacher batman robin is loud colorful action packed and ultimately boring stars
director luis mandoki last film was the superb serious 1994 drama when man loves woman but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture message in bottle which is the worst type of romance movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before and much better so there an absence of suspense and the film ultimately moves at such very very deliberate pace as if it is trying to make great meaningful statements and plot developments that it just becomes tedious bore to sit through message in bottle begins with theresa osborne robin wright penn single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune whom finds bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to mystery woman named catherine and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and to her objection finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper soon heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and ship logo on the top of the typed message and after it is traced to man named garrett blake theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks boating town in north carolina to find out the specifics of the message of course garrett turns out to be handsome rugged man around theresa age and played by kevin costner she is immediately charmed by him but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there and finds that catherine was garrett late wife who died few years earlier do you think you know where this is headed most likely you do and wouldn call it giving away anything to say that by the picture end the movie has fallen into deep artificial melodrama that didn buy for second if there are any positive things to say about message in bottle it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman as garrett stubborn but loving father are far above par to be in such wasteful shaggy dog love story and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast and paints chicago as an equally alluring city meanwhile costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less than stellar films that he has made recently it seems that with such bad luck he wouldn want to make another movie set near water but here he is again with one of the main and most ridiculous centerpieces set on storm swept sea the other actors are all sadly wasted including illeana douglas an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the friend roles here playing penn confidante and co worker at the tribune the first half of message in bottle plays like hum drum trite television movie for the lifetime channel as theresa spends great deal of time getting to know garrett with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining usually am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships but here it all rang with resounding falseness since the dialogue felt written and not as if people were really talking when the main characters of film have very little of interest to say to each other and are not particularly interesting themselves you know immediately that you are in trouble swear that while watching message in bottle felt as if had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater heck in actuality not even familiar to the novel this is based on by nicholas sparks always one step ahead of the characters the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried and true hollywood melodrama the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa secret and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after this same exact problem occurred in last year very very similar watch this and you will realize just how similar mean meg ryan nicolas cage romantic drama city of angels although theresa is deeply touched by the heartfelt letter that she finds in the bottle perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding message in bottle of their own preferably before filming began it should have read memo to screenwriters use you brain
the king and warner brothers animated musical feature recycles the classic story of woman who challenges the heart of king with obvious results when anna miranda richardson british schoolteacher travels to saim to educate the king martin vidnovic children she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly and must say something to the greedy ruler meanwhile the king prime minister ian richardson the stereotypical villain plots to overthrow the king taking the throne the last and most predictable main subplot deals with the king son allen hong and his love for servant tuptim armi arabe and how he conflicts with his feelings and the ancient laws of saim not even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent as the king and problems could fill the blank pages of journal will only note the major difficulties for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail the screenplay written by arthur rankin peter bakalian jacqeline feather and david seidler which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein has some of the worst dialogue written in film within recent memory as every time the obnoxious king would shout etc etc etc would cringe literally speaking of cringing did quite bit of this during the rather short film which is classic display of terrible filmmaking besides the repetitive dialogue from the king on the whole the songs seem out of place and unlike the lyrics are unmagical the sole song which is used cleverly is getting to know you which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors which they have never been exposed to unlike disney animated features the king and songs don add to the film and are as uneffective as could be take the following scenario as an example as the sheer horror of the king and music is at its worst you re being hunted by dragon what do you do sing happy song martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion you hear the saying two negatives don make positive believe it with the terrible dialogue that the king has along with his awful voice track the king is completely unbelievable only shows mild signs of any personality and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says etc etc etc more and more as the film progresses no personality at the beginning of the movie none at the end and where does this character personality change hey thought anna was supposed to change him isn that the whole plot the prime minister hideous sidekick darrell hammond brings his share of cringes as well oh no another one of his teeth fell out hardy har har he is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets but even at age five would have cringed while watching him by the way this review is going you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films hence why hate this movie because the king and is disgrace to animation animated films such as 1994 the lion king and 1998 the prince of egypt are among my favorite movies of all time the animation team does design their share of well animated settings so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king until realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds have not read the play or seen the oscar winning 1956 film adaption but from what can tell the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play for the king and is never magical nor interesting if it wasn for miranda richardson who voices anna with feeling the king and could earn the title worst movie of the decade instead the king and will just go down as among the year worst the bottom line avoid this movie at all costs not even young children the target audience in this film will enjoy it not the slightest bit
john boorman zardoz is goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on bizarre enjoyment quality all its own not since the rampant bumblings of one edward wood jr has movie been so silly and so serious at the same time of course wood career can be explained by two things he had no money and he had no talent boorman on the other hand cannot court such excuses to explain zardoz or his follow up film the equally awful exorcist ii the heretic boorman obviously had sizable budget matinee idol movie star sean connery in the lead role and although you wouldn know it from this film boorman does indeed have talent this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece deliverance 1972 as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama hope and glory 1987 the slightly over conceived arthurian epic excalibur 1981 and the father son jungle adventure the emerald forest 1985 his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste if boorman is anything he ambitious and when he succeeds it in grand fashion unfortunately the bigger they are the harder they fall and when boorman falls the resounding impact can be heard for miles around zardoz is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies an obsession of boorman his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even the wizard of oz book which figures into the movie plot but despite all this reaching the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling the events take place in the distant year 2293 but there is little of the typical futuristic movie ness to be found in fact things seems to have moved backwards with people riding horses shooting old style guns and living in large victorian mansions it more middle ages than space age the world of zardoz is divided into two distinct hemispheres the outlands where all the poor pathetic people live and the vortex where select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life these immortals never grow old they never engage in sexual activity they possess psychological powers and they live in sort of quasi utopian marxist society where everyone is equal and everyone contributes equally to the society however if one breaks the rules that person is punished by being aged so many years if someone breaks the rules enough he or she is aged to the point of senility and imprisoned to an eternal existence in geriatric home with others aged criminals one of the immortals arthur frayn niall buggy squirmy man with mustache and goatee tattooed on his face is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed like the wizard of oz he adopts god like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in giant stone carved like menacing head this flying head is one of the movie opening images and it dead giveaway of the lunacy to come calling himself zardoz frayn gathers bunch of outlanders and makes them into group called the exterminators whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can procreate and take up more resources from inside his giant stone head zardoz bellows seriously laugh inducting statements like the gun is good the penis is evil that line alone is worth the movie cult following one day an exterminator named zed sean connery sneaks into zardoz flying stone pushes frayn out and goes back to the vortex once there the immortals label him brutal and study him like lab rat taking great perverse care in exploring his sexuality which is mystery to them they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection and there is one downright hilarious sequence where bunch of scantily clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up say hilarious because that is exactly what zardoz is it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so he made this film with the straightest of faces although have hard time believing that as production moved forward he didn get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles he spends most of the film running around in kirmizi loin cloth that resembles diaper mane of hair braided halfway down his back wyatt earp style handlebar mustache and pair of thigh high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on cheap hollywood hooker boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of deliverance which is the only reason can imagine studio would green light this effort he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth 2001 whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in zardoz besides the inadvertent humor sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 and perhaps he was looking for change in pace he got exactly that in zardoz and it wonder it didn end his career sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements is it treatise about the infallibility of eternal life is it condemnation of those who consider growing old to be bad thing or is it social statement something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary come to think of it maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip people high on illicit substances are the only ones can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than completely unintentional comedy
there was time when john carpenter was great horror director of course his best film was 1978 masterpiece halloween but he also made 1980 the fog and 1987 underrated prince of darkness heck he even made good film in 1995 with in the mouth of madness but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 with the terrible comedy memoirs of an invisible man somehow carpenter has lost his touch with junk like his failed 1995 remake of village of the damned to his uninspired 1996 sequel escape from those movies however look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film john carpenter vampires if was him definately wouldn want to put my own name in the title it is sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as vampires the story is simple jack crow james woods is vampire hunter who along with one of his partners montoya daniel baldwin and prostitute katrina sheryl lee survives an attack from the master vampire valek thomas ian griffith since katrina was previously bitten by him crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires couple days later and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her it seems valek mission is to steal siyah wooden cross from roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him my question is how many time have we seen this same story played out well the answer is just about as many times as better version of the story has been made john carpenter vampires sadly enough is one of the most unscary horror films ve ever seen in fact there isn even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105 minute running time the non stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed without any interesting camera work which is usually trademark of carpenter and then we come to the screenplay which as far as can tell is nearly non existent there is no story development and there isn even an attempt to flesh out the characters james woods can be good actor but he has nothing to do here but to say couple of pseudo clever lines of dialogue daniel baldwin has some potential but his character comes off as being very dense and sheryl lee faring much better as laura palmer in twin peaks like all of the female characters plays an offensive stereotypical whore there is not an ounce of intelligence or excitement in john carpenter vamires which is very disheartening coming from an ex fan of carpenter he has said that he turned down directing halloween h20 because he couldn work up any excitement for it and yet when asked about vampires sequel he said he would be happy to do it think that definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent not to mention significant number of iq points
