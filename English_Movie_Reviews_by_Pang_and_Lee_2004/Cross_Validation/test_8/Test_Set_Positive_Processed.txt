synopsis bobby garfield yelchin lives in small town with his mirthless widowed mother hope davis bobby world revolves around his friends especially the spritely carol boorem then one day new boarder arrives at bobby house ted brautigan hopkins is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking as the bond between bobby and ted deepens bobby becomes privy to ted great secret an event which will change both of their lives forever review small but enchanting movie hearts in atlantis easily recalls another king inspired coming of age film stand by me both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys hearts is tribute to the magic of childhood to those summers when the days seem neverending and nothing means more than your closest friends unlike stand by me there is supernatural element to hearts but although it is key to the plot it is not prominent like stand by me this is mostly character driven film and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting yelchin is very good as bobby finding good mix of innocence and resignation more splendid still is boorem whom praised highly for her work in along came spider and who is simply radiant here as carol and then there is hopkins who despite playing such quiet introspective character as ted nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen less successful is davis whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish also found it odd that bobby and carol other friend sully whose death as an adult sets up the movie flashback framing device is paid virtually no attention but hicks direction is lovely without being cloying and despite the movie general lack of incident it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience
carry on matron is the last great carry on film in my opinion made in 1972 it still features most of the regulars of this genre sid james plays the head of gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make profit kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting head of the hospital but also hypochondriac hattie jacques re takes her role as matron and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr goode the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard this time williams is after matron jacques when he needs to prove himself that he is man after visiting dr goode the doctor hawtrey is sworn to secrecy assure you that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other bernard thinks he is having sex change and needs to prove himself there are great cameos from joan sims an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he at work at the railway station sid james gang including cyril his son kenneth cope try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as nurse and live in at the nurses home he has to share room with nurse ball barbara windsor and she soon sees through him the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital pills with panic ensuing there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron however her character seems little more subdued and quieter than her previous matron williams is as usual on top form but sid james isn given very good part in this movie and would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all the same does not go for charles hawtrey for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time he seems to steal every scene he is in by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor talent to full effect the film seems to flounder but it certainly makes up for it with it good storyline and it other appealing characters this film is genuinely funny and could watch it again and again and not get bored
by phil curtolo mel gibson braveheart gave gripping performance as the father of young kidnapped boy in ron howard ransom gibson plays tom mullen wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as deranged psychopath played by gary sinise forrest gump and his band of low life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million tom and his wife kate played by rene russo tin cup were instructed not to inform the police but they contacted the fbi minutes later an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo broken arrow are in tom house and wiring every phone the plot sounds average just like most other kidnap movies that you ve already seen and it was nothing more than that that is until about half way through the movie suddenly tom goes to the fox news room and makes live broadcast saying this is your ransom but this is as close as you will ever get to it instead am offering this money as reward on your head dead or alive at this point the plot thickened and the unusually slow start of the film turned into suspense filled action film with great stunts the last half of the film is very well done another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise as they collide in game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones before this movie sinise played mostly good guys first in of mice men then in forrest gump and most recently in apollo 13 but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of cop gone bad gibson of course was just being gibson in an oscar worthy performance although most of the scenes were quite predictable ransom is very entertaining and suspenseful film
you ve heard all the hype you ve seen all their faces natalie portman the professional as queen amidala liam neeson schindler list as qui gon jinn ewan mcgregor trainspotting as obi wan kenobi and jake lloyd jingle all the way as young anakin skywalker if you ve read any reviews you ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy you also may have heard that this one too kiddie friendly and doesn have enough content for adults believe the hype the effects are stunning the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic the lightsaber duels are amazing and queen amidala sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth but there something missing here and it isn budget or effects it everything money can buy the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad stroked and flat characters the most successful at this is liam neeson who as qui gon jinn jedi master to young obi wan kenobi has quiet dignity and wise commanding presence he is the anchor to this movie as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out portman queen amidala and mcgregor obi wan kenobi don fare nearly so well amidala the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation comes off as stoic stilted and caricatured it appears as though she was vulcan geisha in former life and obi wan although mcgregor makes him very endearing has so little screen time that he nothing but robin to qui gon jinn batman however mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with spark of genuine insight and humanity and he does good job he also absolutely nails alec guiness obi wan in episode scottish accent and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise in fact lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite bit and that one of the problems with this film would never call myself star wars fan especially not considering what it means to be fanatic these days but ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america however if you are the one person in america who hasn seen the films at all or even recently or who doesn bother to brush up on the names of obscure characters you may be hopelessly lost for example one of the film main nefarious characters is senator palpatine for those of you not recently steeped in star wars trivia emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader master in return of the jedi and empire strikes back so obviously his appearance in phantom menace is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series thus making his role here more meaningful lot of the movie is like that r2 d2 and 3po make token appearances and it obvious that lucas is banking on the audience pre existing fondness for them because he doesn do much to add to it in any way same goes for jabba the hutt who doesn look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy even planets make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film tatooine the desert world where luke grew up coruscant the cloud city from empire strikes back and alderaan leia home planet which we never actually see that gets blown up in star wars show up or are mentioned briefly in passing what the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty there no meat no substance that makes you want to love the characters as they are not as they will be another problem is that there are actually too many alien characters in the film was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters had mouths that barely moved making them look more like muppets than actual characters and jar jar binks silly roger rabbitish amphibious character is intended as comic relief but what he really becomes is annoying and fast unlike chewbacca and 3po who got their humanity if you ll pardon the expression from their interactions with the human characters jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind at times making the movie seem like nothing more than very expensive teenage mutant ninja turtles furthermore the dialogue is often stilted and corny and sometimes downright infantile thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot oddly this isn just my judgment lucas has said that he designed this film for kids well he done good job the hero of this film of course is young anakin but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight year old boy that not jake lloyd fault though he does good job of being cute kid which is apparently all lucas asked of him that another mistake of course because the cute tyke becomes darth vader warning spoilers ahead in my opinion there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin future evil in the film the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks and there nothing more than spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie he has doting mother pernilla august making her first english language film and is slave to gross flying gnome on tatooine but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn all hearts and roses is yoda hesitation in allowing him to train as jedi under qui gon jinn his explanation his future is clouded warning major spoiler ahead enter at your own risk of course the noble qui gon dies at the hand of darth maul scary looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts but has turned to the dark side this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double sided lightsaber and his scary facial makeup because qui gon never gets chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force obi wan qui gon young padawan apprentice one level below knightdom must take over the training himself so at the end of the movie we end where the saga actually begins with obi wan kenobi and his young apprentice anakin darth vader skywalker did this story need to be told would say no but is it worthwhile movie to see absolutely if you don enter the theater with jedi size expectations and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle then this is your movie the tatooine pod races are triumph of effects and computer animation the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight and yoda and young obi wan are worth seeing for their origins in simpler happier time above all this is fun movie not deep not meaningful and not profound but fun maybe next time lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co write the script and the guy who directed empire will direct because if lucas does the next one himself it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most potential
sometimes movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest some people call it original or artsy or abstract some people simply call it trash life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings definitely generation aimed movie life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to karaoke based musical dream sequence whew anyone in their 30 or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film it somewhat silly it somewhat outrageous and it definitely not your typical romance story but for the right audience it works lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting well sorry folks but haven seen trainspotting so can really compare whether that works in this film favor or not is beyond me but do know this ewan mcgregor whom had never had the pleasure of watching definitely charmed me he was great cameron diaz character was uneven and bit hard to grasp the audience may find it difficult to care about her thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him misguided you bet loveable you bet life less ordinary was delight and even had bonus for me when realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city utah this was just one more thing didn know about this movie when sat down with five dollar order of nachos and three dollar coke maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for pleasant surprise but think even if had known would have been just as happy life less ordinary is quirky eccentric and downright charming not for everyone but definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies
national lampoon animal house made in 1978 and set in 1962 remains one of the no fuck that noise the funniest movie ever made and this isn just my opinion either everybody knows this and that why about gazillion inferior rip offs have been made trying to duplicate its success pcu anyone and the first person to bring up glory daze gets decked animal house takes place at the fictional faber college circa 1962 where the omega frat calls the shots these guys are wholesome clean cut model citizens bunch of assholes greg their leader is going out with mandy pepperidge but since the silly bastard doesn believe in pre marital sex their relationship never goes further than quick jack off under the stars neidermeyer is the supreme bozo of the bunch walking around with his dick out kicking freshman ass and trying to impress the muff also hanging around these losers is babs future universal studios employee and serious bitch now let just take peak next door at the delta house over here anything goes you wanna throw shit out the window okay you wanna crush bunch of beer cans on your forehead and pour honey mustard all over your chest go right ahead the frat leaders are otter and boon tim matheson and peter riegert otter is the ladies man going out with another girl every night and boon is the comedian he got steady date katy karen allen but she sick of playing second fiddle to bottle of then there are the others pinto wimp flounder blimp day biker stork who may or may not have brain damage and last but not least bluto bluto played by the late great john belushi is the man he the kind of guy who slugs back entire fifths of whiskey then proclaim needed that the kind of guy who puts cream filled snowball into his mouth puffs up his cheeks and spits it out and then says zit get it the story is as follows the omegas are getting the deltas kicked off campus the deltas knowing that fighting the omegas is stupid decide to go out with style throwing wild toga party and ruining the homecoming parade this is the fucnniest movie int he history of the world do yourself favor and go see it
roman emperor marcus aurelius richard harris chooses his trusted general maximus russell crowe as his successor however the emperor evil son commodus joaquin phoenix murders his father before the announcement can be made and maximus as well as his family is sentenced to be executed maximus is able to escape his executioners but is later captured and sold as slave to proximo oliver reed proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money he being former gladiator himself and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself powerful gladiator when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus gladiator begins with great battle sequence between the roman army and germania and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required 40 minutes of exposition after kick ass opening sequence style of moviemaking the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used it choppy slow motion which is unsettling and distracting it similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan but nowhere near as effective the actual gladiator battles are thrilling but also bit disjointed many times it unclear as to exactly what going on all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled we re not sure who blood or by who hand though there an instance of this earlier in the film too that disappointing it comes when maximus escapes his executioners some flashes and few quick cuts later and maximus is free but still don know exactly how he did it russell crowe should have become major star after his gleefully over the top role as computer generated serial killer in 1995 virtuosity for whatever reason his stardom never arrived but he should have it now from here on moviegoers should now be able to say let go see the new russell crowe movie he gets the best scene in the film and one of the best moments of all recent movies when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum it both rousing and chilling joaquin phoenix does very effective job of making commodus person and not just cartoon character which could have easily happened commodus is conniving sneaky and whiny but phoenix never lets the character get silly it very good and very creepy performance oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator and it huge loss to the acting world ve always been fascinated with reed he one of those very talented performers who once had fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years it ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again as he gives fun and sincere performance the film is dedicated to him and he will surely be missed reed death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem as he still had scenes to be completed rather than recast the role and end up reshooting great deal of footage digital version of oliver reed was created at reported cost of million dollars ironically that was probably more money than reed ever earned for single film anyway this digital effect is only used in one scene that am aware of for about twenty seconds and if you aren looking for it you won even be able to tell some of the other digital effects are less convincing however and like always say noticable digital effects take me out of movie immediately it sad that such good film has these distractions movies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects keep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events but is entirely work of fiction however it work of fiction that great entertainment and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2000

zero effect gets its title from the main character daryl zero bill pullman although we don understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film zero is private investigator perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived at least he like to think so however he socially inept being and eccentric in every possible way this fact certainly makes his talents as private eye even more bewildering than they already are zero accomplice is steve arlo ben stiller normal guy who does the business side of the job he the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero greatness as an investigator the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero talents to soon to be client gregory stark ryan neal it turns out that stark has lost key to safe deposit box and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about zero takes the case and the plot thickens his path leads to young pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan kim dickens despite her luminous and seemingly harmless presence she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark through his investigations zero learns why but not without developing feelings for gloria feelings that because of his reclusive behavior are new and confusing to him have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film can idly enjoy movies about private investigators and every once in while film like chinatown comes long that blows me away actually no private eye film has ever reached chinatown greatness zero effect which is jake kasdan first effort as writer director is film about private investigator that succeeds in all attempts it an original funny and completely involving motion picture with so many cliches available to this genre find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them but he didn just successfully avoid flaws he has created great film here one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment take for starters the great cast of characters pullman is terrific as zero showing comic flair that really haven seen from him since spaceballs zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here the fact that he an almost exaggeratedly twisted emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe pullman performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance and the occasional voice over as he going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious ben stiller is also very funny individual he the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny ll shoot you he says to stark at one point have gun and everything his character is also well drawn with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend angela featherstone who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job neal also gives his character bit of depth and kim dickens last seen and underused in mercury rising gets chance to show us her talent here giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film kasdan humor is of the best kind soft spoken and mostly dialogue driven though there are some great visual jokes it the kind of humor that funny even after you ve seen it five or six times there one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is an how that makes him such great detective what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on bed or standing motionlessly with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face his eyes pointing to something off camera but obviously to nothing in particular can convey to you how funny this is but what makes it great film making is that it has point scenes like this are frequent and they provide solid characterization of zero as side note don consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy not to sound elitist find things funny that many do not and vice versa there was clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it have feeling the humor here won appeal to everyone but there certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone interest jake kasdan son of writer director lawrence kasdan is only 22 years old found this out after seeing the film and can remember ever being so impressed with film maker his direction is stylish without being pretentious and his writing is mature full and developed zero effect is the kind of film that ll buy for my collection smart original films like this are rare as it is but this one actually has heart and soul at the end of the film was involved in the characters and was satisfied with the outcome and with kasdan undeniable talent at such young age all can do is hope to see lot more from him in the future
accepting his oscar as producer of this year best picture winner saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over one could almost say the same about his much prized film rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery symbolism ideas and metaphors complex and literate storytelling all possessed of an intelligence that invites even demands constant scrutiny an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth in short the antithesis of all things hollywood yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as desert wind ralph fiennes is the title character an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory and particularly the memory of love is the ostensible focus of the film but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld the same can easily be said for every other character in the film of which there are too many juliette binoche nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of mysterious disfigured dying stranger even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion however that it verges on the comical with so many characters enjoying so little screen time the film 160 minutes can be taxing yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that couldn help but feel that greatness was in the air hints of it were everywhere in man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by modern day swimmer in the sahara in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than world war there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years but ultimately the emotional truths writer director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed in the end was left with the impression that had witnessed quite an oxymoron haunting bore bore is perhaps too strong word but after drinking in the rich production values the cup remains only slightly over half full
while watching wes anderson rushmore it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer the film anti hero was not written with jason schwartzman in mind the young actor making his film debut as 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman schwartzman plays max student who is more interested in his extra curricular activities such as writing edgy plays like serpico and being president of the rushmore beekeepers but sees his grades suffer as result on the brink of being thrown out he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross olivia williams and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume the great bill murray to build an aquarium on rushmore baseball field in her honour unfortunately for everyone involved blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well which gets in the way of max plans to woo her max is one of the best written characters we ve yet seen in the 90s and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age as everyone else has probably already pointed out he is reminiscent of young dustin hoffman although was reminded more of paul from the wonder years from visual standpoint at least hopefully if he avoids typecasting as weird quirky loner types he should earn himself good career bill murray is his equal as blume displaying depth we haven yet seen from him while this isn his best performance that honour goes to groundhog day he is still terrific here williams isn given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray but still does fine work rushmore seems to go just little too long but while it isn perfect film it is definate must see for anyone who wants to see that rarity an american coming of age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality anderson has created modern classic with star who should with any luck rise to even greater success
it is hard to imagine that movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive so delicate so insightful and yes even so enjoyable somehow the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows substantial amount of heart to shine through set in the 1940 the film tells the story of unique young man named homer wells tobey maguire ride with the devil an orphan twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr wilbur larch michael caine little voice father figure to the orphans of st cloud obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage he might as well be of use dr larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics soon homer is delivering babies like professional he refuses to perform abortions instead wondering why the couples just didn behave more responsibly larch too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals marvels that homer continues to have such high expectations of people such is the result of an insulated upbringing though skilled in certain medical procedures homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world he must go out into it befriending young couple who had come to see dr larch he hitches ride with them and parlays that into landing job as an apple picker with group of siyah migrant workers at the orchard where they lived thus homer begins his worldly instruction with new friend candy kendall charlize theron the astronaut wife willing tutor tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life questions many of which he was unaware needed to be asked he demonstrates quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing michael caine is in word brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans many of whom he helped to bring into the world calling them princes of maine kings of new england in his ritualistic goodnight mr caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine delroy lindo life less ordinary has many powerful moments as mr rose the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins director lasse hallstrom what eating gilbert grape and screenwriter novelist john irving the world according to garp who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter regardless of one personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers the title is reference to list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers figuring the rules didn apply to them since they didn have hand in writing them they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along dr larch in his own way acts similarly there is danger in that line of reasoning god has also given us set of rules unlike the list posted in the cider house god rules if followed promise us benefits beyond our imagination and yet many continue to ignore his rules preferring to make up their own as they go through life trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding proverbs [kjv] just as builder follows designer blueprint or conductor follows composer score why shouldn we follow the rules of life given to us by life architect for our own blessing
this remake of la cage aux folles features gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son future in laws the couple robin williams and nathan lane are about as archetypal or as the less kind might put it stereotypical gays possible williams owns nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as heterosexual abode williams is excellent as should be no surprise gene hackman as right wing potential father in law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles the real star is lane his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight shooting uncle is hilarious perhaps it is personal failing on my part but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it luckily for me at least it doesn last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men their son and the deception the question of stereotypes is touchy one these guys personify the homophobic gay image you can almost hear the swishing if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world you ll be outraged but if you can accept the view is that this is movie about gay individuals you ll love it your choice
the story of us rob reiner film is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in way they are rarely touched by film as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in year films well 1999 has two of them the other being the instant classic about very dysfunctional family american beauty the story of us film about the highs and lows of marriage and family is well written heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience including myself cry the story of us tells the story of ben bruce willis and katie michelle pfeiffer jordan and asks the question can marriage survive 15 years of marriage the film is about two individuals who have come together spent good chunk of their lives together and shows when our main characters are him and her during the bad times and when they are us during the good times the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer or at least say they don love each other anymore ben cartoonist and katie crossword puzzle writer have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage as they have grown to follow different views on life family and marriage katie is the more organized sophisticated type who wants to plan everything out while ben is spontaneous adventurous individual who doesn mind doing things differently than they were planned the story of us plays out nicely as the film opens with ben sharing his story with therapist told to the viewer through flashbacks as the film progresses it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage this method is highly effective as we see the characters changing from year to year slowly growing apart through the flashbacks we get to see the story of them through both of the character eyes and this gives us strong sense of what their characters are really like as the story of us has three dimensional believable main characters the screenplay written by jessie nelson stepmom and alan zweibel dragnet is touching down to earth work that hits chord within the viewer much like another one of nelson films stepmom the script has an open honesty and outlook on life one that is so realistic you feel uncomfortable at many times because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar as most families these days most go through the hard times as ben and katie must if it wasn for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote which are rugged and certainly flawed the story of us would have been this year best picture bruce willis usual action adventure star has certainly turned himself around in the past year he went from being man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies to distinguished sophisticated actor as in last summer the sixth sense and now in the story of us willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed good script although wouldn pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan willis handles himself nicely and shines in few of the film most powerful scenes enough that make his performance definite contender comes awards season where to start about michelle pfeiffer pfeiffer performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion you wonder how how it is possible for someone to portray real person with such realism pfeiffer performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring will be in the heart of any viewer that has watched this moving film the story of us is one of 1999 most real yet funny films as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked superb acting direction writing story and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman make the story of us touching unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall the film major high points are the fights between ben and katie as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed and although they also say things like it over or hate you you can tell the two still share deep connection and that inside somewhere they are still an us the bottom line wonderful enchanting and heartbreaking film one of the most realistic heartbreaking films in recent years
capsule rock and roll fable indeed like hubert selby jr novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan and bruce springsteen and ton of fun streets of fire bills itself as rock and roll fable and the description is perfect this is stylish great looking and breezily enjoyable movie that feels like hubert selby jr novel with damon runyan rewrite irected by bruce springsteen noir is one of the few truly american movie genres aside from the hollywood musical and the western this is post wwii brooklyn noir for lack of better label with generous injection of rock roll and an all around confrontational attitude it all works the plot is simplicity itself rocker ellen aim diane lane is kidnapped by vicious street gang led by bloodthirsty fellow named raven willem dafoe very nasty her old soldier flame played by michael pare comes back into town to save her but doesn count on whole bunch of things going askew that about the entire plot save for the spats with ellen manager hilarious rick moranis an encounter with doo wop group that winds up becoming ellen supporting act and whole gang of other fun little touches but in movies like this when is the plot important the movie is all style all visuals and attitudes quotable lines and posturing and it delivers all those things consistently and with great brio and pacing no surprise that it was directed by walter hill 48 hrs who understands this kind of macho romanticism perfectly and has put together movie that mixture of times and sensibilities but perfectly unified in tone when was the last time you could say something like that about movie especially movie where it seems like someone gets decked on the jaw and passes out every 63 minutes on cue streets of fire isn the greatest movie ever made but it occupies totally unique little niche and enjoys the position it has anyone with weakness for doo wop neon motorcycles rainy streets the el studebakers gang pictures lonely heroes and great looking gal giving the microphone both lungs will eat this movie up did
with storytelling this compelling who needs books based on the book by author james ellroy confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years together with director curtis hanson the hand that rocks the cradle the river wild whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film resulted in movie with plot and and script so tight an atom would have to squeeze itself through set in the 50s the story revolves around policemen of vivid personalities jack vincennes spacey is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention there is also the young hot shot rookie ed exley pearce fresh out of the academy and all out to carve name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father the tough and unnerving bud beyaz crowe cop who believes in justice the swift and violent way policemen distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in place where there is no real distinction between good and evil when his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just simple robbery murder even after exley receives promotion for his work on the murder case happenings began to link itself to the murder the eventually reach point of convergence when what actually began as personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of complex web of organised crime in hollywood the last time remember film so clever and compelling was when watched the usual suspects in confidential you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has lot more of `story going for it there is not single moment in the film in which felt was slow at all surprisingly though spacey did very convincing job as the street wise vincennes the movie was carried mostly by the two rather `unknowns pearce and crowe pearce exley is cool and calculative in his actions and there is slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance crowe bud beyaz is the most impressive of all head strong and temperamental he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here superb acting wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing gunfights ever easily the best hollywood piece for 1997

note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned it startling to consider that it was only few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut wide berth the lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history continuing to build on sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast since then though disney animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns with pocahontas the hunchback of notre dame and this year hercules successively proving less and less potent with the once seemingly impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox anastasia disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation the little mermaid while the animation for the film is as is typically the case for disney films unquestionably top notch the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music the film storyline is fairly straightforward young teen falls for handsome man father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man except in this case the chaperone is crab the teen is young mermaid and the object of her desire is human prince what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric she resolutely smitten and she such pure and endearing character that one can help but invest their heart with her this simple but touching love story coupled with healthy dose of smart humour makes the little mermaid remarkably captivating picture one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it the voices cast for its motley crew of characters this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue which started to certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams much heralded turn in aladdin by the release of the lion king and henceforth the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities while it understandable that animated features lacking the name recognition or drawing power of disney say balto use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda or even anastasia showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products it unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy do we really need to hear say demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame is the film entertainment value really augmented by hearing recognizable voice rather than voice which best suits the role not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan fortunately the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid although perhaps more obscure are impeccably cast chief among them is jodi benson 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you who voices the film heroine ariel to perfection with wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor and gorgeous singing voice ms benson provides most engaging anchor for the film she the only reason even consider catching flubber similarly samuel wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian the weary guardian crab he easily milks his lovable character comic moments for all they re worth and his rendering of two of the little mermaid big tunes under the sea and kiss the girl have become the stuff of legend pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea witch ursula while kenneth mars booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel father king triton in large roles and small edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef the little mermaid is impeccably cast of course the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken music and howard ashman lyrics who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr ashman untimely death not only are mr menken tunes unbearably catchy but mr ashman charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film storyline so that the songs are virtual extension of the character dialogue and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film mr menken score for the film is equally top notch the sequence where eric voiced by christopher daniel barnes and ariel tour his kingdom in horse drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr menken fine score it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso styled under the sea as joyfully crooned by mr wright which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song indeed one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune but my favourite is ms benson heartfelt rendition of the ballad part of your world an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope wonderfully lyricized by mr ashman which accompanied by the film most dazzlingly polished animation sequence packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes during the song reprise which builds to crescendo with ariel arching on rock as wave crashes in the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history as of this writing november 1997 has come to an end as has disney limited 17 day re release of the little mermaid there no question that the primary motivation for if not the film reissue itself at least its timing was to reinforce disney dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture anastasia in every respect the re release of the little mermaid appears to be success the film 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively marketed anastasia in head to head competition it siphoned enough from the fox film opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot allowing for disney odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away but although disney motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self serving and protectionist the real winner is the public any reason to put this film back into theatres is good one and it true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen the little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney modern animation renaissance and one of the greatest animated films ever made

don know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people but it something used to wonder about when was younger can decide if first thought it because watched lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with baseball bat but pretty sure andrew niccol screenwriter for the truman show has had the same curious thought the truman show is about man jim carrey whose entire life has been engineered by corporation and marketed to the public since birth he been living in the fictional island town of seahaven fla which actually exists as giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign all the people in truman burbank life are actors and the anonymous townfolk paid extras people watch truman life 24 hours day live with no commercial interruptions revenue comes instead from product placement staple of contemporary hollywood with truman friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else even if you haven seen the truman show you ve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials the trailer and other promotion blitzes if anything ve written so far is surprise to you then pity you for making me primary source for your entertainment news either way you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it because otherwise you ll probably think it sucks it begins with jim carrey looking into mirror reciting the crucial eat me scene from alive wishing his neighbors good day afternoon and evening and living in domestic bliss with his wife laura linney but weird things start happening stage light comes falling out of the sky truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father we learn through flashback that his father drowned when truman was child sailing through rainstorm the death was staged by director christof ed harris who wanted to put fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth not the least of them truman best friend marlon noah emmerich who assures him he not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he ever do is hurt him as truman trusting eyes tear over christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else there even daily behind the scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman existence the key to movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama because premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions and it all hinges on carrey who has to balance comic naivet with real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on he come long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura most fundamentally it just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture person life without the person realizing it how they coordinate extras hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors the most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching show like this sure the most interesting tv genre of the 90s has been reality programming and jerry springer popularity is through the roof but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves and when news shows use hidden cameras it done in the name of the greater good not entertainment but merge the two and you ve got the truman show right now it implausible mean the fcc won let you say the word on the air do you think they let you broadcast every detail of man life to the entire world without his consent one day though it could happen and even though it would mean the end of privacy people would eat it up you know they would

part one of the strangest movies ever made series at www mediajunkies com by scott watson [light spoilers nothing you shouldn read] existenz has been called gooey matrix and while this is correct description in some ways in others it is completely off the only thing the two films have in common is the idea of virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal real reality major difference is that the matrix has base reality that is obviously the true reality while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true and oh what reality it is david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies naked lunch crash but this one is one of the strangest maybe it because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre technology is organic but only some of it cars are normal gas stations are the same cell phones are glowing bug like appendages you jack into virtual reality game using quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus referred to simply as pod high technology has been replaced with organic creatures and it provides truly surreal setting for the characters famous game designer allegra geller fine looking jennifer jason leigh flees demonstration of her latest game existenz after an assassination attempt she is on the run from who still not sure and has to save her pod by playing her game with someone friendly that someone friendly is her dubious companion and security guard ted pikul jude law unfortunately he is lacking fundamental requirement for playing bioport sort of hole in your spine ok exactly like hole in your spine bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail looking wires from the pod into you allowing you to play the game luckily bioport can be installed easily they install them in malls so off they go to get one after crazy series of events at the local country gas station they are able to plug in and play existenz the plot itself is surreal melding of conspiracies reality distortion chinese restaurants and multi appendaged amphibian things it sign of the times but the plot while cohesive in it own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this universe cronenberg just slaps this weird organic tech world into the viewers lap and it up to you to figure out how all these things work and that the true joy of this film entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place you learn little bit piece by piece oh they make pods out of those and it just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you there are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander around including fantastic scene in chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards also the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz the specifics of which will leave for you to discover there lots of little things that set off the weird meter like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video game store the two headed amphibian creature and why that guy at the gas station name appears to be gas it all adds up to supremely far out trip and given the choice think would rather live in the matrix virtual world oh wait already do
on the basis of this film alone never would have predicted that in two years quentin tarantino would become the country biggest hotshot director reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction but is much less substantive more conventional crime story than the big pf here what the two movies do have in common scenes of intelligent amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in logical chronological sequence graphic yet necessary violence an engaging crime story dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial gender slurs three of the same actors harvey keitel tim roth and steve buscemi mexican standoff ending although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it only got one story to tell rather than three crime lord joe cabot veteran actor lawrence tierney has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull diamond store heist the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated instead they are all given code names off the color chart mr beyaz keitel mr pink buscemi mr orange roth mr blonde michael madsen mr brown tarantino and mr peach tarantino chin most of the movie running time is spent with mr beyaz and pink waiting at warehouse for the others to arrive mr orange meanwhile is on the floor dying from gunshot wound the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon leading beyaz to believe one of the five was an informant the story background unfolds through series of flashbacks of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime eventually blonde arrives with police officer hostage and what follows is truly brutal uncomfortable torture scene let just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop ear lot of the time reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist gone wrong movie but there are few sequences that are uniquely tarantino the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on high note the rest of it doesn live up to as the criminals plus joe have conversation on among other things tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonna like virgin another scene involves roth lengthy manufactured story about running into group of cops and police dog in bus station bathroom while carrying giant bag of marijuana neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop like the captain koons altin watch speech in pulp fiction only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie reservoir dogs is good but it no pulp fiction
this sunday afternoon had the priviledge of attending private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city of james cameron most heralded film titanic postponed from last summer with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history this was one film was eager to preview so is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday my best guess it will sink though with many awards attatched to its hull no doubt titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made it boasts the most amazing effects that have ever seen done to date to see ship fall apart with actual people running across the ship flying across the deck and falling to the water is just amazing to look at the effects are so stunningly realistic you would swear you were looking at actual footage but titanic is more than disaster movie and that where the problem lies there is love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise ll give capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you the film begins with modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic we see actual footage of the sunken ship as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor bill paxton leads the expedition in search of sunken treasure what he finds instead leads him to mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage we meet rose kate winslet young woman who comes from an upper class family rose is to be wed to man she does not love we meet jack leonardo dicaprio young man who comes from poor financial background and wins ticket aboard the titanic in poker game the two meet under interesting circumstances and the love story begins add in jealous fiance and not so nice law officer played by david warner and you have story that well gets bit overplayed and oversappy must add at this point that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates as woman with new money who is lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship she is pleasure to see on screen when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 40 into the film and eventually sinks you never really feel for any of these characters the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get grasp on the effects are tremendous from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room to doomed ship cracking at the seams this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other we saw titanic in dolby digital surround and by far it is the best sounding movie have ever seen my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard when people are in the water at film end you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles titanic runs far too long the movie is hours and 15 minutes in length and while most of the first hours runs very fast and well paced the final 45 minutes almost comes to sudden stop and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends don get me wrong about titanic it not bad as am making it out to be it really is an exceptionaly well made film the costumes and sets are incredible and true to the time period the ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form as we see actual pictures of the modern day wreckage transformed into the movie depiction this film will certainly win on effects costume set design and sound cameron has certainly made his best film to date unfortunately titanic is not best picture candidate it just doesn have strong supporting story it an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside it just doesn have the emotional impact that suspect mr cameron was shooting for predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews it is film worth seeing predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office with its extreme running time and lack of enough robust to get substantial word of mouth expect that it will do even better on home video this will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts titanic opens december 19th and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth century fox give titanic stars that not bad ron epstein riginally posted in home theater forum ===
hate to burst your bubble but after all the star power mega bucks screenwriters directors and cool trailers men in siyah is not the best movie of the summer it pretty good in it own right yes but would probably split the best movie honors among face off spawn con air and maybe event horizon it main problem is that it quickly forgettable and can remember one truly good scene from it from con air it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt in spawn it was the living room hell conclusion at the end in event horizon it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell forces and all of face off was pretty dang good but as for men in siyah the only scene still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches remember it not for it humor but because am hate roaches with passion and was pretty disgusted and yes did see mimic which is something ll touch on in later review back to men in siyah is it just me or does that sound funny remember first hearing about men in siyah back when was comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard etc for those of you who aren comic geeks wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars what the new yorker is to high society what boy life is to boy scots okay that one was pretty pathetic few people know this but men in siyah is based on very obscure comic book that was while not honest politician rare very hard to find this was after the release of the high grossing batman forever and it said that tommy lee jones and chris donnell were being considered for the roles in the comic book there were no siyah men in siyah kind of weird huh all can say is thank god they didn cast chris donnell know can be the only person on the planet who thinks he an annoying preppie little snot sorry my apologies to donnell fans actually had 7th grade teacher who was big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him anticipating rather craftily that if the movie was big hit it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely he decided not to sell them to me because they were innappropriate hmm so now you re probably wondering why ve wasted about paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years good question ll move on to the movie now as you probably already know will smith and tommy lee jones agents and respectively belong to top secret agency known as divison or it nickname mib men in siyah men in siyah is reference to the siyah suits and sunglasses the agents wear and they re mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they re here on earth not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the people in the world who haven seen this movie but basically big roach type bug lands in redneck farmer yard inhabits his body and attempts to destroy the entire universe not bad eh have no idea why just typed that not even really paying attention anymore the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in siyah found their main headquarters to be boring as were the cool weapons they had the noisy cricket just plain sucked no matter what anyone said and the movie definitely surprised me in tone although it probably shoudln have it director barry sonnenfield is known for siyah humor directing both addams family movies this movie was basically siyah comedy not an action sci fi like expected from the trailers don get me wrong on what think of this movie it not bad gave it it was mostly entertaining throughout it run and had very good ending although think was the only person in the theater not amazed by it my diagnosis for this picture good weekend rental but not worth movie ticket of course the movie is now long gone from theaters but that beside the point think

if you want some hearty laughs then rat race is the movie for you this unpretentious little comedy which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype will have you bouncing in your theater seat and while the film fits neatly into the low brow slapstick school of comedy one refreshing aspect is its lack of mean spiritedness the plot follows group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner john cleese who must race from vegas to bus station locker 700 miles away in silver city inside the locker is duffel bag containing $2 million the first one to open the locker gets the bag and the money what the group of participants doesn know is that cleese donald sinclair can do anything want eccentric is staging the race as betting game for group of high rollers at the hotel the participants include vera whoopi goldberg and merrill lanai chapman newly reunited mother and daughter disgraced pro football referee owen templeton cuba gooding jr italian tourist mr pollini rowan atkinson randy pear jon lovitz and his family the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody seth green and vince vieluf and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer breckin meyer various amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city screenwriter andy breckman adds nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another the most side splitting situations involve vera and merrill encounter with the squirrel lady nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates owen commandeering charter bus full of lucille ball look alikes on their way to lucy convention the cody brothers misadventures with hot air balloon flying cow and monster truck and the pear family stopover at barbie museum which turns out not to be what they think it is the pear family situation is fine example of the way breckman script builds the laughs without going into detail this bit segues from the museum to hitler touring car to eva braun dark lipstick to lovitz burning his tongue culminating at ceremony honoring world war ii veterans rat race cast is first rate cleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap lovitz is at first bit whiny but his character grows on you gooding is having fine romp and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleese deadpan assistant man born without personality the film is directed by jerry zucker who knows something about comedy along with his brother david and friend jim abrahams he was responsible for such hits as airplane and ruthless people throwaway subplot which is good for some laughs features cleese and his buddies betting on series of outlandish situations including one dealing with hooker and pepto bismol this is fun little feature the only letdown comes at the finale which is too touchy feely and sweet almost negating what came before it rat race is summer sleeper but it will keep you awake as will the laughter of those watching around you
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction the cinematic output from its creator quentin tarantino has been surprisingly low oh he been busy doing the talk show circuit taking small roles in various films overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn making cameo appearances on television shows providing vignette for the ill fated anthology four rooms everything it seems except direct another feature length film it been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr tarantino new feature film jackie brown one of the most anticipated films of the year and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s things aren going well for jackie brown pam grier she 44 years old stuck at dead end job $16 000 year plus retirement benefits that aren worth damn as flight attendant for the worst airline in north america and she just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton and police officer mark dargus michael bowen smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun runner ordell robbie samuel jackson who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry robert forster the loquacious ordell based out of hermosa beach house where his horny bong hitting surfer girl melanie bridget fonda and agreeable crony louis gara robert de niro hang out operates under the policy that the best rat is dead rat and he soon out to silence jackie brown meanwhile the authorities target is ordell and they want jackie to help them by arranging sting to the tune of half million dollars only through series of clever twists turns and double crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses although jackie brown marks mr tarantino first produced screenplay adaptation based on the elmore leonard novel rum punch there no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film while he adhered closely to the source material in narrative sense the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character now siyah in terms of ambiance the film harkens back to the 1970s from the wall to wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions the opening sequence featuring ms grier wordlessly striding through the lax funky music blaring away on the speakers is emblematic of films of that era the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro of course nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists backstabbing and deceptions deliciously unfold the strength of jackie brown is the quiet understated relationship developed between jackie and max when they kiss it perhaps the most tender scene of the year tenderness in quentin tarantino film sure there ve been moments of sweetness in his prior films the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer or even in reservoir dogs where deep unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters but for the most part mr tarantino films are typified by manic energy unexpected outbursts of violence and clever often wordy banter these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown but what new here is different facet of his storytelling willingness to imbue the film with poignant emotional undercurrent and patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr tarantino as simply helmer of slick hip crime dramas with fast talking lowlifes and heralds him as bonafide multifaceted talent he the real deal this new aspect of mr tarantino storytelling is probably best embodied in single character that of the world weary sensitive and exceedingly professional max cherry whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching mr forster nuanced understated performance is the best in the film he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie we smile along with him much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation era icon pam grier in the lead with the wags buzzing that mr tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta then sagging career as it turns out ms grier is solid in the film title role although nothing here forces her to test her range do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection though she been working steadily over the years often in direct to video action flicks but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton mars attacks and larry cohen original gangstas where she first teamed up with mr forster of course it true that her role here was godsend meaty part as this is rarity for any actress let alone one of her age and current status in the industry while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone it marks tremendous growth of mr tarantino as director whose horizons are rapidly expanding and whose characterizations have never been better and while the film narrative doesn really warrant running time of 155 minutes it filled with such sumptuous riches ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining inconsequential conversations between the characters that there wasn an unengaging moment with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt it ll be interesting to see what he tries next

it is often said by his fans that hal hartley movies are an acquired taste indeed while perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungee jumping they require no less amount of physical stamina and concentration felt rewarded at the end of henry fool this movie creeps up on you at slow 139 minutes mean creeps and despite the final shot ambiguity left completely satisfied henry fool used to have an arrives at garbageman simon grim house claims the vacant basement apartment and almost instantly inspires simon urbaniak to take up writing henry martin donovan look alike ryan is an ex convict once great author who has been exiled and marginalized by the publishing community because of his criminal activity simon poetry turns him into local sensation as it causes mute women to sing high school girls to swoon and councilmen to rile against its pornographic content meanwhile henry seduces both simon dependent mother porter and immature sister sundance queen posey with philosophical babble which is by turns brilliant and inane and breathy animal lust these story elements result in climaxes both inevitable and unpredictable the teacher student relationship formed between henry and simon eventually reverses itself henry fool is sprinkled with hartley ian flourishes simon drinks milk from udderley the big teen hang out is called world of donuts simon wears his garbageman uniform throughout the editing style is decidedly elliptical which is key to the conclusion said ambiguity the performances by the three leads are abrasive at first self consciously quirky the introductory scenes are chore these people do grow on you because they convey genuine passion belief in themselves and because they have long term goals henry and simon may drink lot of budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner but they aren pop slackers the story is rather classical the tutor is better talker than doer raised on books the timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams of shades of film school the finished film is epic in its proportions for story so small and the final third does test one patience yet henry fool is tight hardly excessive in its length how refreshing to see movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character and unless nodded off not single building exploded this hartley seventh feature is contemplative about the artist fortunately we never get sampling of simon work and it testament to the actors and the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort of thoughts would pour from these writers pens

according to hollywood movies made in last few decades life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to human being even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark god forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience on the other hand it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view this film is amarcord 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs as well as series of local often very colourful characters although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist 14 year old boy titta played by bruno zanin and chronicles his sexual frustrations obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca played by magali noel problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family as well as troubles his father played by armando brancia have with mussolini fascist regime amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film and it probably explains why it is very popular even among those people who actually don like federico fellini work very much every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film word amarcord is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase remember in local italian dialect in the same way the word is distorted so is the past in memories of those who remember it after the premiere fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film but it doesn matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini childhood or not any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film fellini views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images characters look like caricatures actors playing them often deliberately overact and women especially those who fuel titta sexual fantasies often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions every now and then scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters visions because of that almost everything in this film looks different and in most cases better than it would have looked in the real life even the fascism gets fellinian make over fellini views mussolini totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history and opportunity for comedy when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda fellini doesn care that much about politics lack of self righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini humanistic approach to his characters each of them regardless of age gender social class or physical appearance is given opportunity to express his or her views dreams and fears fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people because of this warmth and democratic spirit amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable melancholic and even tragic moments fellini couldn produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave very personal touch to this movie vignettes aren memorable because of the characters only fellini uses camera painting film in bright colours especially in the scenes that depict character fantasies fellini also knows how to use locations whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel bright coloured beach or rural countryside even the down to earth streets of rimini where everyone knows everyone gets magical dimension during the snowfall on the other hand lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini long time associate nino rota his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced that music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art
written by mark rosenthal and lawrence konner starring charlize theron bill paxton david paymer as reviewed by james brundage beginning to get fed up over my four years as critic the thing which has kept me going is the moderate balance of films the good balances the bad try to see both in equal proportions but disney mighty joe young remake marks the fourth week in which haven seen truly terrible movie it backwards machismo suppose the urge to see the things which you so loathe but need to see bad film every once in while and you know what mighty joe young doesn qualify far from being bad mighty joe young is actually family fun movie it enjoyable appropriate cute cuddly and all of those other things that ve been seeing in every movie since bug life mighty joe young tracks 000 pound gorilla in the wilds of africa that is taken to reserve in california for safe keeping okay little unrealistic but who ever said kid movie had to have the slightest hint of realism the first half of the movie is gorillas in the mist esque hatred of poachers woman of the wild motif the second half is straight up parody of king kong awestruck onlookers and all mark one down feeling relaxed it is as point of fact an extremely un creative movie but as vetern can say quite honestly that creativity doesn count for as much as it should so that saves mighty joe from my wrath although my colleagues and cohorts and surely bashing this film at this very moment this is not the film to take girl on date to it not the film for you it the film for you and your family when you re right alongside your kid all of the normal rights and wrongs slip away the same thing happens when you watch horror movie or an action flick it becomes fun all you have to do to enjoy mighty joe young is shut up and watch
lean mean escapist thrillers are tough product to come by most are unnecessarily complicated and others have no sense of expediency the thrill ride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot perhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive which featured none of the flash bang effects of today market but rather bread and butter textbook example of what clever script and good direction is all about the latest tony scott movie enemy of the state doesn make it to that level it true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through maze of cell phones and laptop computers without looking back although director scott has made missteps in the past such as the lame thriller the fan he generated good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun that vibrant spirit is present here shown in well timed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed enemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography director of photography daniel mindel throws staggering amount of different views angles lenses and film stocks at the audience that goes long way toward involving the audience in the movie enemy is truly visual experience and that only one of the reasons it such fun watch the movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds jon voight reynolds wants new communications act passed to allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance equipment but the senator plans to bury the bill in committee reynolds has the senator offed but not before the murder is caught on naturalist camera by an extremist chain of events the tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean will smith posession and it not long before he running from reynolds cronies it only with the help of an ex spook named brill gene hackman that dean is able to get to the bottom of things the acting is top notch and the three principles smith hackman and voight are generally more mature and excellent all around smith puts aside the wisecracking act and becomes normal human being voight tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role smith regular joe comes off particularly well as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not the supports are also in fine form lending credibility to the main roles and advancing the plot in key areas this is for the holiday crowd the hot ticket as well as anyone looking for serving of genuine action in market that is otherwise lacking
1992 alien3 marked not only the death by suicide of its popular protagonist ellen ripley sigourney weaver but in many ways the alien franchise itself box office receipts were anemic thanks to poor audience word of mouth and the critics who rallied around the first two installments 1979 alien and 1986 aliens savaged david fincher slog of sendoff myself included hence weaver director jean pierre jeunet and the others behind alien resurrection faced two fold challenge not only somehow resurrect ripley but also rescue this once profitable series from the scrap heap despite the odds they have succeeded even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two writer joss whedon devises quick easy and painless answer to the dead ripley problem clone her which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 the prison planet of the third film that done the _real_ challenge presents itself what do with her alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable exploring her maternal side alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death what could be next whedon comes up with clever spin since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen the blood used for the clone is also infected with alien dna so the new ripley is indeed new human alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength psychic bond with the deadly species and more predatory attitude unfortunately that is where alien resurrection clever streak in writing stops the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought the movie begins with plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding but once the creatures break free it is once again ripley and ragtag crew this time bunch of interstellar smugglers including tough waif call played by game winona ryder trying to exterminate them and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy while the settling into tried and true formula is little disconcerting the formula is tried and true for reason and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon the alien after all these years is still terrifying and new breed that is introduced is no less so the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting most notably an extended underwater sequence the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji as technically adept as jeunet direction is perhaps his and for that matter whedon greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for but the self awareness of the excess just adds to the fun no alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott alien or the even greater film that james cameron aliens was but after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher alien3 jeunet resurrection is welcome return to its roots as wild reckless thrill ride that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments
remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over year ago picking up the grand jury prize at the festival holocaust comedy receives standing ovation the headlines read intrigued by this statement looked up information on the film and found that sure enough life is beautiful is in fact comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years even though the movie was extremely well received by critics and public alike couldn help but be disgusted at this notion human tragedy is not something feel should be celebrated only now do see the error of my ways after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time it became clear that it is not as the headlines proclaimed holocaust comedy on the contrary life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps rather it focuses on the relationship between father and his son who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation roberto benigni who also wrote and directed the movie stars as guido orefice chaplin inspired clown and all round jolly guy who as the film opens is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher nicoletta braschi benigni real life spouse through the course of the first hour or so we see guido striving to get the attention of this beautiful princess as he calls her employing the magic of laughter the italian comedian wins her heart and together they raise young boy named giosue child actor giorgio cantarini life treats them well until hitler minions rise to power and the family is whisked away to german camp where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son innocence no matter what the sacrifice granted it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp but it does not pull hogan heros and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews somehow it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it gravely serious subject so we ve established that life is beautiful is not holocaust comedy but there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me the film despite critic declarations of it being triumph of the human spirit is no such thing not in my eyes anyway some have called the story an affirmation of the beauty of life but say it is very dark and bleak statement about man capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy the film ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently but found it to be truly discerning and upsetting essentially life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film however am not denying the movie greatness believe me it fantastic just saying that think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as but perhaps reading more into the movie than is really there maybe the film brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit in fact maybe roberto benigni has made film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of movie exactly what you put into it
when it cold molecules aren moving everything is clean these are the essential words of mikey carver elijah wood young teenage boy living in 1973 new canaan connecticut in the ice storm when mikey delivers these words to bored science class it is unlikely that anyone realizes how much they parallel mikey life and the lives that surround him his father jim jamey sheridan is rarely seen and his mother janey sigourney weaver is having an affair with married neighbor ben hood kevin kline ben wife elena joan allen suspects the affair but doesn say anything meanwhile ben 14 year old daughter wendy christina ricci continuously lures mikey and his younger brother sandy adam hann byrd into sexual explorations tobey maguire plays paul hood the 16 year old narrator of the story who also happens to be the least prevalent character we start the film with an interesting outlook on family from paul he compares family to the fantastic four comic book and even goes so far as to say that family is everybody own anti matter something everybody will return to eventually and the farther you go the deeper you ll return the ice storm is character piece that explores dismal time both in america and in the individual lives portrayed in the movie everything parallels everything else the young teenagers trying to discover who they are thru drugs sex and alcohol is really almost identical to the parents trying to figure out the purpose in their own lives using the same methods when it cold outside the molecules aren moving everything is clean everything is clean because nobody will admit what going on even the president is on tv denying his wrong doings how can you expect anything more out of couple of suburban families riding the coattails of sexual revolution all the sex and drugs is so obviously empty and think that the point of the film at first viewing the entire movie might seem empty but then why shouldn it parallel itself you don get to know the characters very deeply but think that because nobody in the movie knows each other either we sadly watch two families go about their lives nearly oblivious to one another at first glance you might think emotion is lost in the ending scenes because you haven gotten to know the characters well enough to sympathize then you realize that just might be the point and then you do feel the pain the acting by all is quite good but particularly liked elijah wood he doesn seem to be receiving as much recognition as the others but still found him to possess quite real sense of being christina ricci is being acclaimed for her part as the misguided teenage temptress who looks for something more to her life in the pants of every available boy still say hats off remain to wood joan allen subtle but believable performance as lonely unappreciated wife and the always excellent kevin kline tobey maguire did fine job but his character which perhaps was the most intact sensible person in the story seemed little lost he was needed but perhaps he should ve been used more the ice storm is being hailed by many as one of the best films of the year hate to say that don agree but don in fact can think of many other films that would rank higher than this one even so it is very good film it takes lot of retrospect to fully appreciate it art but when you finally start seeing things in it that you didn before you start to grow even fonder of the characters and the story perhaps this is one to see ponder and then watch again with different eyes
in tim burton `sleepy hollow there is mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name he rides beautiful siyah steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe burton update on washington irving classic tale of `the legend of sleepy hollow offers us the mystery of the horseman when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror writer andrew kevin walker `seven throws in perhaps too healthy dosage of sherlock holmes but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine as `sleepy hollow opens we re greeted with juicy cameo from martin landau who won an oscar in burton `ed wood landau plays prominent citizen of sleepy hollow who on fateful carriage ride through the forest is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town constable ichabod crane johnny depp is sent in to investigate landlord baltus von tassel michael gambon explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case and that they believe the murderer is dead hessian trooper played briefly by wonderfully jarring christopher walken who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods crane is not man of great superstition and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets things was not surprised to find in tim burton movie first and foremost `sleepy hollow is fun horror film as with virtually all burton movies we are treated to wonderful score by composer danny elfman who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly the horseman are stylish and impressive particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors but why did enjoy `sleepy hollow as much as did although enjoyable it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right it was the light comic touch that burton applied the film has the sweetness of candy apple usually channeled through depp wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane who is no longer mild mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities this is certainly not the only alteration that been made as the film progresses it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together because for the audience it not an issue we particularly wish to be solved it more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive still we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton keen eye to capture our attention the costuming is exceptional and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout it recognizable that the script was refined by award winning playwright tom stoppard the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel daughter katrina and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent walken michael gough who appeared in burton `batman films and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles suppose the strengths behind `sleepy hollow lie within the central trio director burton constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy all of this is not to be taken seriously of course `sleepy hollow is lavish frightening and altogether amusing reworking of classic tale that many people cherished as children if you ve got decent head on your shoulders you ll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time
bowfinger is good movie about the making of very bad one the screenplay written by co star steve martin skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy science fiction movies to chop socky fight sequences and all in crafty and accomplished manner anyone who knows of or has had any association with movie making should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it entire duration the central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one bobby bowfinger martin cheapskate and small time hollywood producer has always dreamed of making successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so new script an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain has caught bowfinger eye after confronting big name producer named jerry renfro robert downey jr in restaurant an agreement is made to finance the movie but first bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey eddie murphy to sign in on the project kit turns the offer down immediately but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film after emptying out his life savings the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved and then prepares to film the movie without the star knowledge the actors confront ramsey on the street saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage the unknowing star who is terrified of aliens and being abducted is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him when the conditions become even more treacherous bowfinger is forced to hire kit ramsey look alike named jiff also murphy sweet natured dork who runs for coffee in between shooting vital scenes these include attempting suicide run across an lane freeway and one of the `hot scenes involving supporting actress daisy heather graham removing her blouse bowfinger takes it sweet time getting started but when the plot switches into high gear great things happen certain scenes are so precisely executed perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall down funny no hilarious standouts include the chase through parking garage in which ramsey who supposed to be being followed keeps checking behind him to investigate strange tapping noise it actually bowfinger dog in high heels and just try not to laugh in the climactic kung fu sequence featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas while the entire 97 minutes of bowfinger isn always on target individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles masterful comedy director frank oz dirty rotten scoundrels in and out who has never made bad movie ensures quality final product and is aided immensely by martin sharp edged script however the real on screen star is eddie murphy this is the actor finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early 80 murphy excels at every corner not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey but in creating likable buffoon in jiff as well these three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise and the reward is virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs steve martin generates the power behind bowfinger but murphy fuels it this is summer time comedy that unlike something such as american pie and south park doesn break any rules but it still just as uproarious or perhaps even more side splitting than anything we ve seen this season the supporting cast including christine baranski as work loving actress and jamie kennedy as the cameraman all perform well within their limits the only presence that demands real attention when placed next to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham as the young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top graham attempting to further her stardom after appearing as the new powers girl in ap2 displays cheerful but naive persona that nicely corresponds with the wackiness of the screenplay wouldn be caught dead buying ticket for chubby rain but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough
know it already opened in december but finally got around to seeing rushmore last weekend and it was one of those rare oppritunites that got to leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price as the final scene closed out in happy slow mo fashion felt happy to have been priveleged enough to watch such good display of filmmaking jason schwartzman his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and glasses steals the show as max fischer the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades but compensates for it by organizing most of the school clubs and organizations the fencing team and writing and producing school plays and often pulling outrageous stunts one that eventually earns him an expulsion this stunt building an aquarium on the school baseball diamond is plot to steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross olivia williams he funds this aquarium with the help of millionare herman blume very oscarworthy bill murray who eventually finds himself falling in love with miss cross rosemary and herman begin dating and the fun begins herman and max go at it head to head in battle for miss cross herman manages to destroy max bike while max cuts herman brakes and it goes on like this but eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross and he can stand in the way of two people in love the academy of arts sciences really messed up this year they completely overlooked rushmore and if you ask me it wasn an accident it maybe wasn best picture material but it certainly deserved screenplay nod instead of elizabeth and bill murray absense from the ballot is complete snub the entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good at one point it fun and the next scene can turn serious and dramatic the cinematography gives the movie an important feeling as well hope rushmore can overcome its oscar snubs and be enjoyed by intelligent film goers

the film starts out with creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer director producer john carpenter who in my mind is brilliant director he really is he wrote this film he directed this film he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost it popularity or it ability to scare the wits out of people think have seen halloween over 100 times and each time find something new and brilliant and each time am scared even though know what is going to happen own three different versions of the film vhs regular version that came with limited edition 20th anniversary shirt boxed edition vhs in hardcover case digitally re mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation in nifty plastic picture decorated box with numbered snow globe in other words am completely and utterly obsessed with the film it has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only and being truly good it also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to true halloween fan since heard about halloween being released on dvd in limited edition of 30 000 copies knew had to buy one no matter what did and man to me it the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film no words can describe the dvd in halloween michael myers is evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood 16 years ago in 1963 now in 1978 grown up and in mental hospital michael myers escapes to go back to his hometown of haddonfield illinois followed by his past doctor sam loomis the person michael is targeting is laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film debut why is he stalking her check out halloween ii it explains it all on this unholy night on october 31 1978 laurie strode and her two friends are going to have the time of their lives which is trying to stay alive the whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk nick castle who played the shape in the first movie did an incredible job and no other person in any other halloween flick can do what he did what john carpenter did in 1978 is made ground breaking new film with scares wit and style the movie is flawless if not perfect no other movie or sequel has lived up to this one and in my opinion never will halloween will be like psycho and still be extremely popular even almost 40 years later just hope someday halloween will be released in new dolby soundtrack with the extra scenes on the dvd edition halloween isn just another slice and dice horror flick it an intelligent horrifying and best film experience ever made see halloween and be scared then watch it again reviewed by brandon herring october 1999
frequency the number of times specified phenomenon occurs within specified interval as the number of repetitions of complete sequence of values of periodic function per unit variation of an independent variable etc don worry when watching the thriller frequency you won have to know what the heck frequency means the premise although it may sound complex is very basic on the big screen new york cop john jim caviezel finds radio in his house which allows him to communicate with his new york firefighter father frank dennis quaid who died thirty years ago immediately john warns his father that he will die trying to stop fire in an abandoned warehouse when frank takes his advice and survives the accident he wasn supposed to the two eventually realize that by changing that one moment in the past they have created whole new future in which serial killer murders john mother and nine other women it is now up to john and frank to use their special connection and save thirty years ago to make present time better place told you that wasn confusing overall was very pleased with frequency it occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized with its suspenseful serial killer scenes usually don buy those cheesy love you dad segments in movies but this one surprisingly satisfied me maybe because the plot is so creative and universal that believed that this is how most people would act when talking to dead relative frequency creepy premise left me thinking once the film ended what if what would do would help my own family or save historical figure from being assasinated or stop some kids from shooting other kids or buy stock from yahoo character in the film does the latter with humorous consequences frequency also reminded me of the fantastic back to the future both share that change the past slightly and you ll change the future heavily warning the changes between the present and the past such as different newspaper headlines or people disappearing and reappearing in photographs are very similar both are also wonderful feel good family films that can attract to number of generations the only difference worth noting is that frequency final scene doesn set up possibility for lucrative sequel already in the making there are some problems with the film though first there is major flaw in the story towards the end that is somewhat distracting email me if you have seen the movie and want to know what think it is the plot must have confused even the filmmakers who frequently no pun intended switch from 1969 to 1999 while telling the story another problem is that the supporting cast including noah emmerich and andre braugher are underused while in the film which is not enough the aforementioned actors steal every scene they are in frequency was pleasant surprise for me and the audience saw it with who cheered at the end even if you know what is going to happen or if you think the preview ruined the movie for you like it almost did for me check this movie out you may be surprised as well
jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and lot of expectation even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation this is after all the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell falsehood since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio desperado four rooms and from dusk til dawn he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films but never took the director helm nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta star once more tarantino returns with film he can call his own the film opens up with an homage to the graduate with jackie brown pam grier on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her jackie is flight attendant for air cabo which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas this makes jackie convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi samuel jackson who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico however while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the for ordell jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus michael bowen and atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton who catch her not only with the money but with bonus of couple of ounces of illicit drugs jackie didn know they were in the package with the cash but that of no consequence to the authorities who threaten jackie with couple of years hard time if convicted of course dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish ordell ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry robert forster to get jackie out of jail but while max is immediately attracted to her jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police sure enough ordell shows up at jackie apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good but she borrows max pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell instead of closing the irony circle and relocating bullet from the pistol chamber to ordell head jackie proposes deal since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be courier for him once more but this time for more substantial fee fifteen percent of ordell half million dollars with gun in his face how can ordell not agree by itself this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film however we are also introduced to number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell but she also making deal with the feds as well as with max the film throws us off every once in while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually sham but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around instead it actually nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today movies at least this film has little imagination most of the performances in jackie brown are above par pam grier of whom had never taken notice before plays jackie with mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable samuel jackson has kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy trying to do his best never mind that he belongs to profession where sneaking into guy apartment to zap him with stun gun is simply matter of course he just so down to earth the nature of his job really doesn occur to us even when we re shown him bringing handcuffed woman to prison or when we see the tools of his trade in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara recently paroled friend of ordell and bridget fonda as melanie one of the girls ordell keeps around town unfortunately de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between and then they are mostly clipped sentences in this film he not really de niro but stereotypical de niro uttering things like little bit and pretty much fonda on the other hand plays the slightly spaced out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness such that even when she is annoying louis we are taking her side as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had hand the dialog is quick and snappy it grabs our attention and is actually interesting and in many respects this makes jackie brown film which needs few visuals the lines are form of art in and amongst themselves don count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera however there scene where max is unwittingly watching dry run of money exchange and he not really sure what happening but by composing the scene just so his realization of what going on is felt simultaneously by the audience we look at the screen and think gee that clever and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on although tarantino isn afraid to drag out shot for dramatic effect it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film there are shots where character is simply driving and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head this is tribute to both direction and acting however there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through mall and she is looking for something desperately looking for something we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she looking for but instead hoping she ll just stop overall viewing jackie brown is time spent well some flap has already been made about the language used in the film but it really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today in fact one might even be able to say that the way in which these offensive words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness go see the film and see what mean
by now figured seen every alfred hitchcock film at least half dozen times not that complaining to call him the master of suspense is an understatement the paradine case 1947 admittedly one of hitchcock lesser movies turned out to be one missed this one like all hitchcock films is well worth savoring the story opens with the rich mrs maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband as mrs paradine alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world to franz waxman stark and moody music we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels stripped of her fine raiment she becomes commoner again which as it turns out was what she was before she met her husband brief skirmish and you ll be lunching at the savoy again anthony keane her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting predicting fast and easy trial gregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister she no murderess he argues simplistically smitten by her beauty she too fine woman his attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife gay ann todd unlike most hitchcock movies which are centered on the thriller and the mystery this one is more romantic melodrama typical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light she deflects her husband affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client the dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs paradine portrait nearby in the relatively unsatisfying first half little happens other than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires to the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs paradine acquitted because if mrs paradine dies his heart will go with her if she is freed he will be able to forget her as part of the soap opera mysterious louis jordan plays mr paradine valet who has had some not to be discussed relationships charles coburn plays anthony legal partner sir simon flaquer and charles laughton who looks like coburn is judge lord horfield this being proper british society they will all dine together at the judge house not long before the case begins court tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences some subtle and others not between the american and the british judicial systems one for example of which was not aware is that the barrister cannot speak to his own client during the recess if she is the process of testifying one sometimes wonders what the academy is thinking when they make their oscar nominations as the judge wife lady sophie horfield ethel barrymore got nomination for best supporting actress the film only nomination for an inconsequential part with which she did little of merit so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walk on at 37 minutes into the film he leaves train station carrying large musical instrument case don miss it in the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into the courtroom the great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high to set the exact tone for the trial action as anthony explains it the simple case has only possibilities mr paradine poisoned himself mrs paradine did it or the valet did it the end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid the paradine case runs 53 the picture is in siyah and beyaz it is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up if they are interested

after hearing reviews for woody allen upteenth movie in history celebrity range from terribly boring to just so so my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of manhattan my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time woody allen films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand in hand manhattan really is one of the best looking films ve ever seen beautiful siyah and beyaz photography of the city best areas etc fan can help but feel visibly moved the film opens up with the usual credits with plain beyaz font over siyah backgrounds and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack but then the screen fills with gorgeous dull gray sky with the word help being spelled with an airplane beethoven 5th blasts on the soundtrack the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment and it all rather lovely to look at and then we cut to film crew shooting this as the film hilariously banal key moment in the film where the lead actress in the film melanie griffith looking as buxom and beautiful as ever has to realize something wrong with her life or whatever it terribly stale scene for woody allen film with the great opening shots or without and my heart sank and soon got used to the fact that once again new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works though for the record last year deconstructing harry came awfully close what the hell has happened to him the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas bullets over broadway though wonderful relies on irony to pull farce that just never totally takes off mighty aphrodite is more full of great moments and lines than really great story everyone says love you was more of great idea than great film even deconstructing harry is admittingly cheap in way even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films if anything the reception of celebrity by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time it not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is it him celebrity is yes good film but it only marginally satisfying as woody allen film instead of creating the great woody allen world he created world out of subject he knows only bit about and he fashioned film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities so that it plays like series of skits with minor connections it like la dolce vita without the accuracy the right amount of wit and the correct personal crisis woody becoming more insecure in his old age choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead much has been said about his performance dead on but irritating makes one yearn for the real thing blah blah blah but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh performance though featuring some of the same mannerisms stuttering whining lots hand gestures is hardly warts and all impersonation branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm which actually allows for his character flaws to be more apparent woody flawed guy and we know it but we love him anyway because he really funny and really witty and really intelligent branagh allen is bit more flat out bad but with the same charm so that yes we like him but we re still not sure if he really good person or not his character lee simon is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie hits on extra actress winona ryder then goes off to interview griffith who takes him to her childhood home where he makes pass at her and she denies him sorta we then learn through flashbacks that lee has been sucked into trying to be celebrity thanks to mid life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion he has since quit his job as travel journalist and become gossip journalist of sorts covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate so that he can meet them and maybe sell his script bank robbery movie but with deep personal crisis as such he has divorced his wife of several years allen regular judy davis and continues on quest for sexual happiness boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film after griffith comes his escapades with model charlize theron who is polymorphously perverse glad to see allen is using new jokes ha ha who takes him for wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of la dolce vita following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen relationship that almost assures him success and his continued escapades with ryder whom he fancies most of all his story is juxtaposed with that of davis who flips out but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into handsome friendly tv exec joe mantegna who lands her job that furthers her career to national status while lee is fumbling about selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness davis becomes happy ve become the kind of woman ve always hated and loving it without doing thing the result is film of highs and mediums the mediums are what take up most of the film with sitations and scenes which don exactly work but you can help but pat allen on the back for trying but other places are really great scenes the opening the sequence with theron which is so good that wished it hadn ended banana scene with bebe neuwirth droll as ever and perhaps the best sequence romp with hot as hell teen idol brandon darrow played by none other than leo dicaprio who is so un dicaprio esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film they never look at him the same way he ignites the screen with intensity and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical and totally heartbreaking for lee who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read and finds himself on wild all day ride with him they go to atlantic city to watch fight they gamble and they wind up in his hotel room where darrow gets it on with his flame gretchen mol and he lends him one of the leftover groupies allen writing in these scenes are so good that just for them almost recommend the film almost but what really liked about this film is despite the fact that it mess despite the fact that what this film really needs is good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself it still smart and insightful film though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced some seem too cartoonish even for this environment allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities as it may seem to be if it were it be extremely out of touch but about those who want to be celebrities and how they equate celebrity hood with happiness we never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they re really happy they may appear to be on the surface but we do get close enough to lee and davis character lee is obsessed with the phenomenon while davis takes is at arm length and never gets too involved in what it is and soon becomes one herself besides it witty and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen that great woody allen feel it may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject and yes as part of woody allen oeuvre it merely blip no annie hall but it no shadows and fog either but it goes to prove that no one can make film like him and only he and maybe godard could possibly take totally horrible metaphor like the one in the beginning and make it work not once but twice
call me crazy but don see saving private ryan as the film of the summer good movie yes with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg best work no personally if was spielberg wouldn go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler list and the indiana jones movies guessing steve has thing for nazis really wouldn be surprised if velociraptor ate one of the swastika wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie all lofty pretenses aside saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of 1980s slasher flick the difference is it easy during friday the 13th to laugh off spear sticking out of kevin bacon chest while blood spurts like crazy but it damn hard to sit and eat reese pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield and believe me there plenty of it 30 minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain tom hanks and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire lives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on and all the young men in the audience find themselves never ever wanting to be drafted cut to some bureaucratic defense office where hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties one woman happens upon an interesting detail three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat and their mother is getting the telegram today guess it an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother so the army chief harve presnell sends hanks on what is essentially public relations mission to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home that way the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs ryan one good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know it mission designed to make the army look good they question the worth of risking eight soldiers lives to save one and hanks character admits he doesn give damn about ryan he just following orders if this was john wayne movie things would be different there be phony let go get that boy gosh darn it attitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war by doing things this way spielberg admits the instincts of self preservation and complacency that every normal person has it makes saving private ryan lot more powerful than an testosterone driven stallone movie mission the movie pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semi introspective conversation among the soldiers hanks is painted first as nails tough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men it not that way for long edward burns the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck isn available is the impulsive one jeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time and so on none of the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes but was spielberg obvious intention wondered when heard saving private ryan was three hours long how were they going to fill three hours time searching for one person and still make it interesting there are few false starts hanks finds one private ryan in ted danson company apparently danson joined the army after ink was canceled and breaks the bad news before learning it the wrong ryan and of course the movie far from over when hanks does locate ryan matt damon the other guy you get when affleck isn available that when the movie turns into more of conventional war flick although body parts and limbs still fly like never before saving private ryan is worth your time but it definitely no schindler list the battle scenes are intense and realistic but some of the attempts at sincere emotion aren the movie bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out whining tell me ve led good life tell me good man spielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any three hour movie about the past should be framed by self contained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present much more effective are subtler scenes like the one where several of hanks men are rifling thrugh bag of dogtags from dead soldiers and they make light of what they re doing by pretending they re playing poker this while an airborne division marches by their eyes full of that mound of dogtags by not explicitly pointing out that it symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in war the audience gets the message and even if it not classic saving private ryan is definitely one of the better war movies out there
lot of times three star film will be my favorite they re usually the kind of movie can watch most often too they re usually not too deep allowing for semi brainless relaxation and at the same time not too dumb men in siyah is four star three star film hope you could follow that one men in siyah doesn wait to get to the fun just minutes into the film we are introduced to agent kay tommy lee jones introduced to an alien and introduced to the the awesome memory diminishing tool that all mib agents use after all you can have alien witnesses running around with that kind of knowledge can you men in siyah is of course the organization which moniters all extra terrestrial activity on earth nypd officer james edwards will smith is on routine foot chase when suddenly the no good punk he chasing starts leaping up buildings and blinking more than one pair of eyes the alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end and with that dives off of roof naturally nobody believes his story nobody that is except for the top secret organization that not even the government is aware of edwards then meets agent kay the man who never seems to crack smile and is introduced to the mib edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped of anything that can point back to him birth certificate drivers license and even the literal removal of his fingerprints james edwards no longer exists meet agent jay agent kay takes the rookie jay under his wing as they go about regular duties eventually far more treacherous event comes into play bug has landed on earth and is going to wipe out mankind if these two don or can stop it the plot isn exactly clear but we know it has to do with galaxy as big as jewel or marble being sought after on earth and that is crucial that the mib find it before the bug does barry sonnenfeld who also did the addams family films directs this nicely it fun it funny it action packed nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be this is one of those movies that is just fun and can really be summed up any nicer or clearer will smith and tommy lee jones both do great jobs and both are blast to watch definitely one of the best films of the the summer of 97 men in siyah comes highly recommeded from me
wonderful little movie that is really interested in its characters and in its theme the scene of second best is laid in wales james chris cleary miles is 10 year old boy who must live in home because his father keith allen is in prison and his mother committed suicide james is mentally unbalanced child he can forget what happened in the past and he dreams of living happy life with his beloved father in the home he feels sadly and lonely one day social worker alan cumming tells him of person who wants to adopt him this person is graham holt william hurt graham manages post office and shop in village he is single and hasn any real friends his mother is dead and his father is ill and will die graham feels that he has been disappointment to his parents there has never been real love between his parents and him graham monotonous life would get new sense if he could adopt james but graham has not only to convince the institutions but must also win the love of james james and graham have to open theirselves they must get to know each other and learn to understand and trust the other person james and graham aid each other to cope with their problems but will their relationship really have future second best is based on novel by david cook who also wrote the screenplay the film was directed by chris menges who had made his directing debut with the very good anti apartheid drama world apart 1987 88 and maybe second best is even greater picture this precise richly detailed sensitively and convincingly directed study about special adoption treats its theme with great seriousness the breathtakingly intense film shows the necessity of human contact and communication william hurt delivers an outstanding performance as graham holt and chris cleary miles is remarkably convincing in the role of the boy the supporting cast is also fine especially jane horrocks as debbie social worker who is charged to examine graham living circumstances second best is an underestimated masterpiece it pity that films like this one are made so seldom eagerly await menges next directorial work the lost son which will star daniel auteuil
this is good year if you want plenty of sci fi on your multiplex >from the comedies mars attacks and men in siyah to luc besson powerful the fifth element and to this sci fi horror that is event horizon more is on the way with contact and alien ressurection being released later this year the story is thus in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out newly invented gravity drive device that enables craft to travel anywhere in the universe instantaneously this is achieved by creating gateway infact siyah hole between the craft and it required destination in this case from near neptune to proxima prime however when the event horizon attempts this it dissappears without trace leaving two searches for it fruitless seven years later it reappears transmitting distress signal and this is where the film starts search and rescue ship is sent out to investigate the team is led by laurence fishburne and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive as the team search the event horizon they find no trace of the crew but plenty of blood lying around not good sign to make matters worse as they search the ship they find themselves being subjected to series of illusions based on their own individual inner secrets and worse some very bloody events start to occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago it soon becomes apparent that wherever the ship went it bought something back with it something very very evil the first thing you ll notice in this film is it incredible visual effects they really are eye popping with some great models to boot the acting is quite good with some occasional witty moments sam neill does good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more and more disturbed as the search continues but tip of the hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads the team in cool calm take no nonense manner it is his acting skills that help hold this film together the idea behind event horizon is certainly good one it starts off incredibly well but the middle section becomes quite confused and sometimes muddled leaving the viewer unsure on just what the reasons are behind some of the bloody and bizarre events that occur however the closing 20 minutes of the film more than make up for this producing one the most nail biting or in my case straw of my drink biting climaxes ve recently witnessed overall event horizon is smart film indeed it very enjoyable and has some amazing visuals but be warned the horror scenes despite being very brief are very very gory not for the squemish
rebel without cause is such an important film in american history because it is true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to everyone feels that they are different in some way that they don belong in some places and rebel without cause successfully shows on screen these universal emotions no matter what generation you belong to these feelings are present this is why james dean is admired by america because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute in our minds we just try to do the right thing just like dean jim stark does not only does rebel without cause display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered uniqe pattern in its social structure each generation looks at its past generation without strong connection this is because times change and in response people change no matter how popular you were once as your generation grows older newer breeds look at you in different light this is why stark and his friends never could form strong relationship with their parents even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past the teens could not believe this in one humorous scene stark his girlfriend judy natalie wood and his pal plato sal mineo pretend they are adults they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored this scene shows that what was once cool in past generation is the complete opposite in another speaking on behalf of my generation feel that dean has lost lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by the only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation same goes for brando redford even deniro can only imagine how vaguely matt damon ben affleck and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century will dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten any film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly milestone in american film even if rebel without cause has some ridiculous scenes the game of chicken did people really act this way an unbelievable conclusion how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end and silly romance wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for couple hours it still is fabulous film the acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool now however the coolness is fading
one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel that concept although many purists doubt its scientific credentials spawned many interesting novels comic books and films in the last century however the big grand daddy of time travels wells novel the time machine wasn written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences the author wells merely used it as convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich idle capitalist class and impoverished labour whatever intentions wells had the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration first of them was george pal who in 1960 directed film which would through the years become genre classic of its own the plot revolves about george rod taylor victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension time at the eve of the new 20th century george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention machine that would enable him to travel through time they are skeptical but that doesn prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future at first he travels slowly seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars finally after witnessing world war three he travels far into the future hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions when he finally reaches year 802 701 ad at first glance new world looks like utopia humanity consists of young beautiful but idle eloi people who are fed clothed and taken care of by unseen machines but weena yvette mimieux eloi woman tells george about another side of the coin in the night her people is preyed upon by morlocs humanoid creatures from the underworld the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature the fantastic concept was brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times for wells it was frightening threat of class struggle for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie even the modern audience which would be tempted to discard the film as old fashioned could find some values in its universal messages fit for each era compared with the genre films of today the time machine is even better and could serve as good example how to make intelligent thought provoking films of course since this is hollywood product after all the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness for example it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today some of the final scenes that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero are also rather unconvincing but on the other hand the film is very well directed cleverly paced and the special effects although definitely old fashioned are more than adequate for this kind of picture the acting is good with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george trusted friend filby yvette mimieux who plays weena on the other hand would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role however despite all those flaws the time machine is very good piece of cinema something that connoisseurs of quality science fiction films sorely miss these days
luckily some people got starship troopers some people knew it was supposed to be silly for those of you who didn how could you miss it from the very beginning when we see an interactive internet like promotional video for the armed forces of the future it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly guess without blatant one liners and home alone style slapstick some people just don recognize such goofy humor such dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned first thing to do before seeing this movie lighten up meet the equivalent of beverly hills 90210 meets mighty morphin power rangers four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces which in the future means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country johnny rico casper van dien is ready to join the infantry mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez denise richards has enlisted to be pilot dizzy flores dina meyer has enlisted as trooper and it possible she joining merely to follow rico whom she always had eyes for if you saw these three on the street you automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers for never has movie cast looked so much like the cut out cover of seventeen magazine the lone non supermodel carl jenkins played by doogie howser himself neil patrick harris is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie er carl out of the picture good call now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters right off the bat rico becomes the star of the show far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in short period of time but horrific accident during standard training exercise which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen leaves rico ready to call it quits with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home well sorry rico suave but there no place like home especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it that right the planet is being attacked by colony of arachnid like alien beings that can of raid just isn going to destroy with sudden change of heart and clothes rico is back in the game following his fellow starship troopers off to fight mean group of daddy long legs what starship troopers really is is spoof of all that it even remotely touches on the soap opera like love affairs of high school the love for sci fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group etc nothing is taken seriously it almost as much satire on young adults as clueless but with its sly and futuristic approach it not as recognizably so it spoof so subtle that many won recognize the spoofery if you deem this as sci fi action you re wrong it sci fi action comedy with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well gore is factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film but the gore too is meant to be cheesy yes it graphic but it also brutally phony and that what makes it such great fun to watch not since the old mr bill skits on saturday night live has torture and mutilation been such joy to watch people were laughing out loud every time body was severed in half or head was viciously decapitated perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters barbie dolls as young children with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely it good chance this is the case whether we re fully aware of it or not starship troopers has it slow parts but it truly an alternative to your typical sci fi action flick or lame juvenile comedy aside from the intentionally cheesy gore the special effects are quite astounding when the spaceship passes meteor it quite an awesome spectacle visually crisp and captivating if you re looking for brainless fun this is the epitome of your search beautiful cast awesome special effects fast paced action campy acting and whole lot of gore this is brainless heaven just remember not to think
one of the sweetest tales to ever be made it wonderful life isn perfect but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results probably the greatest feel good film of all time it wonderful life aims for the heart and strikes with golden arrow on christmas eve george bailey stewart is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls you see george is in trouble and he has always helped others who needed it this one time however god answers his prayers and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence travers to try and save george clarence has got his own problems however clarence is an angel without his wings and each time the bell rings the wings pass him by the bailey case is way for him to earn those magical wings and become true angel but before clarence can save george he first has to go through cliffs notes version of george bailey life we see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother life sacrificing his college education to save the family business sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else when the bank his family owns is in trouble george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn sold to the evil mr potter barrymore who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls one christmas potter gets his chance uncle billy bailey mitchell loses $8 000 of the bank money without the money the bank must close down george is stuck in tremendous bind and contemplates suicide clarence the faithful servant is there just to pick him up and to show him what bedford would be like without george this is all lead in to the very famous last scene where george finally sees what true happiness is about it wonderful life does have its faults the movie is beginning to feel dated in the details especially in the treatment of women and men the sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the 90 like something out of revisionist look all the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film there are however endearing moments in all of this capra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50 to make the movie remarkably enjoyable the story is hackneyed and the ending feels well little too sugarish there this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything especially the sequences where george is either in trouble or helping somebody it little too nice for my liking at times there is however enough humor enough wit and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part which would be the most difficult but watching it wonderful life is never boring or difficult it always interesting right until the finale which for all its sugar makes delightful sense and is beautifully done capra does have his monumental cliches but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection donna reed is perfect as the loving obeidient wife and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr potter everyone else is magnificent including bert and ernie ward bond and frank faylen there is general sense of goodness as if everyone in the film knows that they are making great film and they relish that stewart however is the king of all of this he is sometimes awkward especially when saying merry christmas to all objects animate or inanimate but he is james stewart and he lovably delightful throughout the film have complained shouldn have this is really good movie no this is great movie better yet this is phenomenal movie there is reason classics are invented to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life this is one of those films it is feel good movie something people complain little too much about but capra reworking of christmas carol is the greatest christmas movie of all time there ve said it have to admit the first time saw this saw it with my family including my 11 year old kid sister they all loved it they loved george his wife his troubles and the beautiful ending is it little too sugar coated maybe no matter this is film that should be watched time and time again with families around coffee table and eggnog on the plate it is film that just makes you feel good about life family and hope it is the perfect christmas film flaws and all it is frank capra greatest acheivement and that really does say lot for about 121 out of 129 minutes this movie is flawless the rest can be excused no film is perfectly flawless can get over how much love this movie and how much you will after watching it digesting it and sitting with your family appreciating how special life really is
the heartbreak kid reviewed on aug 26th 1998 starring charles grodin cybill sheppard eddie albert in the heartbreak kid charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious characters ve seen on screen in long time he guy who spends virtually the entire running time of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film as the film opens he has just gotten married and is on the way to miami beach for his honeymoon halfway there he begins to resent his bride by the time he arrives at his hotel and has met the cybill sheppard character he is ready to divorce his wife as played by grodin this character is the type of person that nothing will ever be good enough for him the phrase the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence was practically written with him in mind however if he finds something he really wants he will pursue it for as long as it takes the only problem is once he has it he immediately loses interest the end of the heartbreak kid is both hilarious and sad for that very reason charles grodin is at his smarmy best here and sheppard is quite appealing as the object of grodin desire however the real scene stealer is jeannie berlin daughter of director elaine may as grodin whiny bride she owns every scene that she in and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do the heartbreak kid was written by neil simon and it shows simon loves to deconstruct and analyze human relationships and he at the top of his game here as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin character is he the type of guy that everyone knows the character of george costanza on seinfeld seems to have been modelled after him the only problem with the film is that it not that funny and it billed as comedy as much as could see the realism in the characters it would have been nice to have chuckle here and there the heartbreak kid is not date movie it has an extremely negative view of relationships so seeing it with girlfriend boyfriend could be hazardus to your health
capsule this is 1950s or 1960s style heist film set in the present robert deniro stars as risk adverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of personal friend played by marlon brando edward norton plays hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the crime the plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense +2 to +4 am sure must have seen almost the identical plot before this is heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens there are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment there is no rock score there are no ballet like martial arts this is just basic heist film with decent and distinctly credible and un flashy script nick played by robert deniro is safecracker who has managed to be successful by never taking risks if job is not safe bet pun intended he backs out sometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe when one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to decide that it is nature telling him that it is time to get out of the game he returns to his home in montreal where he owns jazz club and decides to manage it full time he proposes to his girl friend diane angela bassett she has one condition he must stay retired from crime but before the deal can be cemented max montreal kingpin and personal friend has one last supposedly easy job for nick nick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal more and more details seem to complicate the job nick partner in the crime is to be smart but uncontrollable young crook jack edward norton jack treats locked front door like welcome mat even at his associates homes the young crook is know it all who seems good at everything he does but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way together they plan to steal priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house the script by kario salem lem dobbs and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old mission impossible television series we see pieces of the heist being put together last minute changes and things that go wrong much like good episode of mission impossible this team might not be bad choices to write scripts for the tom cruise mission impossible films the complications are however no more and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable the telling is cold and noirish which is just what it is supposed to be director frank oz the voices of yoda and miss piggy proves surprisingly good at directing serious crime film the score has more than adequate cast with little flashy or scene stealing acting edward norton probably has the flashiest role and even that is low key by today standards he plays what is nearly double role jack pretends to be brain damage victim to be hired for job in the customs house one nice character have not mentioned is stephen jamie harrold stephen is master hacker who lives in his mother basement in house with lot of screaming in both directions he seems like the last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon the film itself remains low key up until the time of the climactic heist then the pace really picks up before that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes though oz never lets the music steal time from the story the way woody allen does in sweet and lowdown on the subject of music the score of the score is by howard shore it adds tension to the suspense scenes but never seems to have much of melody angela bassett is the one misused celebrity in totally minor role that should have been played by less famous actress who needed break she has nothing to do in the film but demand that nick give up crime and to look like an attractive reward if he does speaking of being attractive the score seems to be attracting an older audience who learned to appreciate much the same sort of film in the 1950s and 1960s it does the job rate it on the to 10 scale and +2 on the to +4 scale
no matter what you suspect this isn your usual action thriller the usual suspects is an intelligent crime mystery story from up and coming director bryan singer it one of those movies that after everything is revealed rapid fire at the end you immediately want to rewind and watch again because earlier scenes take on new light plot twists go go are what you get here gave up trying to figure out the mystery of keyser soze after awhile and just sat back and waited for them to reveal it to me keyser soze is name you ll hear at least hundred times if you watch the usual suspects and for good reason it not only the name of the mysterious and possibly even mythical crime boss in the movie it also sums up the movie keyser soze in latin means an intelligent crime mystery story from up and coming director bryan singer or maybe shouldn have bought foreign language dictionary from the same company that makes those 99 cent encyclopedias sold in supermarkets at the movie opening group of known criminals are brought in for police lineup including mcmanus stephen baldwin keaton gabriel byrne fenster benicio del toro buckney kevin pollack and verbal kevin spacey winner of the best supporting actor academy award{symbol 153 times new roman 10 h} for his performance in the movie verbal is so named because he frequently rambles on about anything or nothing he also earns his name as the movie narrator spouting memorable lines like the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn exist although obviously he does exist what else could explain kris kross having comeback in 1996 while being interrogated by police detective chazz palminteri any actor with multiple in their name is okay in my book we see the story unfold as spacey retells it the five felons upon being released from the lineup get their revenge on the police by exposing corrupt taxi service whereby elite criminals pay to be smuggled through town in cop cars and stealing all the money and drugs in the car it definite case of male bonding for the five criminals who later find out they were brought together by the unseen keyser soze who sends minion to them with an offer they can refuse namely they have to destroy soze main competitors in organized crime by infiltrating ship shooting bunch of people burning all the drugs and stealing $91 million cash spacey does terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent cripple character to life and baldwin byrne palminteri and the rest make for good supporting cast the usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence and explosions with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense keeping the viewer guessing until the very end and then still leaving few details open for scrutiny and discussion suppose all that would be cleared up if really had rewound the movie and watched it again instead of changing the channel and wondering in disbelief what the hell kris kross was doing on mtv different mystery guess which may turn into _murder_ mystery if that video ever comes on again
every year every year at the festival wait for that film to come along that one that just pulls me out of my seat sticks its face up next to my nose and roars sur prise into my bewildered visage it almost always surprise it sure as niflheim was this time amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as modern fairy tale of boy in montana who quits his little league team for very unusual reason and in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film it might very well be nothing more than fairy tale where we roll our eyes occasionally smirk to ourselves and maybe get forced tear out of the eyes and boy wish that could happen sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash another another short circuit this film floored me for the simple reason that while it has fairy tale concept the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough and presents itself well enough to make it more of an american folk tale with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time america has always had its mythical heros its paul bunyans and john waynes this film presents us with more general but still universal ideals the honest innocent children who have their own inner wisdom the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage honor and love for their respective sport the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding but has the grit to get things done when they need doin does the latter sound familiar amazing grace and chuck is showcase for these characters but it never leaves you with the feeling that it artificial that it stands behind glass or that any sharp breeze or more importantly sharp thought will shatter the wax facade of the panorama this is very sturdy scenario the principals are always given dialogue and always give performances always it just blows me away which made them seem real yet enforces their particular mythic role the writer producer david field seems to literally take all the yeah but in real life this would have happen thoughts you get in your head sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading in stronger way then before astounding he uses obstacles to the plot to enforce it am truly impressed indeed envious with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay it so very unusual especially in hollywood film don want to give too much away but the basic premise is that chuck joshua zuehlke the little league pitcher decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons his decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete boston basketball player alex english amazing grace smith and well leaving it at that because wouldn spoil this film for you for the world let me just say this though am not recommending this film because think it has great message or because of any political positions it might imply don give rat ass for the political point of view this film expresses one way or another recommending you go see this film because and only because it an excellent story told with excellence no don believe what happens in this film could happen in real life while tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted believe in careful negotiations mutual verification etc screw what think the point is this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream have ever seen on the movie screen this is the natural and more all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion and much better script to boot it carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhood and more importantly without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of self consciousness special kudos to both zuehlke real life little league pitcher who was picked for the part and english forward for the denver nuggets for their seamless personification of their characters jamie lee curtis who takes surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing manager and friend william peterson in big change from his role in to live and die in as father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave flag doing it and gregory peck as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was and who some numbskulls still probably think he is
[note after claiming otherwise my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding better mousetrap as it happens it didn take long is there more romantic director than franco zeffirelli known mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968 romeo and juliet required viewing for many high schoolers and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare he is also favorite at the metropolitan opera where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many puccini aria last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre one of the twin peaks with wuthering heights of romantic literature it might seem peculiar then that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen at first blush hamlet is far removed from romance the hero though prince is depressed conflicted and confused the ostensible love interest gets little screen time and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery the plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus it is zeffirelli genius however that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace in this italian master hands romance is everywhere in son worship of his father in the bonds of deepest friendship in the private thoughts of young lovers even in the mystery of castles by the sea after all the story hinges on ghost and what could be more romantic than that what seemed like cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all namely hiring then reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and lethal weapon in the series of the same name would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language franco zeffirelli that who and it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money what gibson brings to the role is naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful not to mention comprehensible his line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed his movements and gestures excepting his sometimes too active eyes are totally in keeping with the character this is hamlet whose pain we feel whose struggle we empathize with and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at film end glenn close the other big name in the production also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlet mother gertrude though must confess still trying to understand the character as written zeffirelli incestuous interpretation of hamlet relationship with his mother doesn help alan bates makes believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of hollywood heavy by and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably of special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone both support the realistic mood marvelously as do the sets and costumes without any overstated effects that declare this is important this is shakespeare particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all the melody of wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due perhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare definitive and there are certainly quite few other filmed versions of hamlet that have not seen but if you ve ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the bard this hamlet is an excellent place to start

one of the best movies ve ever seen heard extremely good things about this movie and though the previews didn really intrigue that much it was movie been anticipating for few months now for some reason not sure of this movie was not that big sucess over in the it was definite hit with the critics but didn exactly set any box office records after viewing this incredibly well directed written and acted movie can help but wonder why the strength of this film is it gritty realism the main characters are all human with individual flaws no stereo type hollywood heroes you may not agree with many of their actions in the movie or their approach to life but that is what makes it so real had expected this movie to be more of drama than thriller but was mistaken even the interrogation scenes moved at such pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase and the ending whoa ve never seen movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly the three male leads guy pearce kevin spacey and russell crowe are all just terrific the best actor oscar talk surrounding this film should have netted one of them statue but there is one problem there how could they have chosen between these three actors there is no way could look at this film and say one of them was better than the other two it impossible kim bassinger performance is also revelation never been big fan of hers before and always thought she was well what the word twinky that impression has changed as she complemented crowe and pearce perfectly the depth to the story and characters is truly astounding no cardboard characters here the plot is full of twists and turns and some very clever sequences pearce interogation of three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant really can fault this movie at all was so glad to see fellow australian pearce and crowe star in such breathtaking movie had been very familiar with russell crowe beforehand from his many australian films but had not seen much of guy pearce intend to change this next time visit the video store
historical epic as genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s for many critics scholars and most importantly film producers it was thing of the past something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black and white television and non cgi special effects but in 1995 same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre and same as in the case of dances with wolves he was awarded for his effort with oscars the name of the film was braveheart and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace 1272 1305 in his time english king edward longshanks played by patrick mcgoohan has almost completely subdued entire british isles including scotland whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by ius primae noctis and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights although english had killed his father many years ago young scottish commoner william wallace played by mel gibson doesn care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron played by catherine maccormack murron death changes that and wallace takes arms and together with small but dedicated band of followers begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country through time more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace rag tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce played by angus macfadyen who wouldn like to have simple commoner as national leader braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson so it wouldn be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann however even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale like vision of picturesque castles splendid costumes and knights in shining armour gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard short and brutish this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle where hand to hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details never seen since verhoeven ultra naturalistic flesh blood compared with this naturalistic approach most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays braveheart also employs humour at the right places not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences but also to underline its down to earth atmosphere so different from previous historical epics what makes braveheart larger than life is his protagonist mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and as result character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero wallace is more than superior to his enemies both physically and mentally yet he is able to show his sensitive more vulnerable side naturally when the character is based on epic poems most of historical accuracy is going down the drain which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s however even those who don particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel played by sophie marceau and make her child because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended and final scenes aren as effective as they should be mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan whose cold calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema brendan gleeson who would later become famous for his role in boorman general is also very good as wallace trusted companion as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy stricken king john balliol david harra is very entertaining as wallace irish ally and angus macfadyen brings lot of anxiety into his conscience stricken character of robert the bruce women in this film have rather thankless roles especially marceau as one dimensional french princess catherine mccormack as wallace wife was more interesting but she was eliminated from the picture early on from the technical point of view the film is also very good photography by john toll brings lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen on the other hand the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern day instruments for period piece set in medieval times although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism the main reason for that was the fact that gibson among many historical facts chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of longshank son prince edward played by peter hanly he is not only presented as villain but also as one of the less competent in villain camp and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in politically correct hollywood to make things even more obvious good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals however although the message of this film might look right wing it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century according to that ideology oppressed classes workers peasants are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and as such they are more radical less willing to make compromises and more efficient on the other hand privileged classes aristocracy bourgeoisie are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety in the end whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre
synopsis rumored to be about true person the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over thousand years and has inspired operas literature and even coinage since 1984 china has been issuing annual altin and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures the 1992 set includes mulan in the ballad of mulan written in the 5th or 6th century an imperial edict by the khan emperor orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china girl parents hear sighing and think that their daughter mulan the name means magnolia is dreaming of boys but actually she dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle mulan bravely runs away masquerading as boy to serve in the army instead of her father ten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later the army finally returns in triumph the emperor wants to reward mulan valor with prestigious position in government but she declines accepts horse and returns home quietly to don her true clothes mulan old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually woman the disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story only it adds modern character for comic relief mushu the dragon eddie murphy in disney mulan when fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army old mr fa soon tek oh is handicapped and has no son he has only his spirited young daughter mulan ming na wen fearing for her father life the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair disguises herself as man and sneaks off to serve in the army in her father stead meanwhile mushu the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family has been reduced to the size of squirrel and the status of incense burner his only duty is to ring gong mushu hits upon plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become macho male warrior hero with the help of mushu horse and lucky cricket can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family opinion east meets west know chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors from their state of the art animation studio in orlando disney is hoping to work the same kind of east west magic with mulan mean what would you say if told you that new movie featured tang dynasty art with donny osmond singing ming na wen acting and eddie murphy playing chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson yet this is the case in the disney re interpretation of the familiar chinese classic the end result is spectacular mulan is one of disney best movies ever personally also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak willed subservient asian woman take beating mulan is portrayed as normal if spirited compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative mulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney kids of any age will like the family themes and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing and adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor while the boys admire the battles and adults can admire those male female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family honor and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love gumption and questioning but even the tiniest details reveal quality the movie art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look negative spaces positive detail period clothing and graphic designs typical of the time and place computers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30 000 people and special program called attila was used for spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback and singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game balance is crucial movie about chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney cup of tea but if you use the character as comic sidekick to balance determined and spirited heroine then pow the dream team by the same token tale about girl in the army might be sober exercise in filial piety by itself but toss the dragon in there and you ve got enough wahoo individualism for light hearted disney romp it rare that movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west old and young male and female into cohesive and entertaining whole but mulan hits the universal bullseye it movie for any age creed gender or color
if you ve ever perused my college comedy diary another year in the life of nerd never run out of cheap plugs you know didn get along with my first semester roommate too well in fact during the three week period between thanksgiving and christmas break said total of four sentences to him so when saw in the residence hall cable listings movie called roommates envisioned 90 minutes of conflict between couple of bickering young adults trapped in 10 13 foot dorm room then saw that the star of roommates is peter falk scratch that idea but still say someone should film the story of two college roommates whose relationship is less than ideal of course in my case it would be silent picture even without the college element still decided to watch roommates because had absolutely nothing to do unless you count studying for final exams and who does glad did peter falk performance was actually what made the movie and this is guy never considered real actor more like someone who went around in trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries falk pleasantly surprised me here permanently earning my respect so all you columbo fans who think live to insult the guy can just falk off falk plays rocky 107 year old polish baker who raises his grandson after both the kid parents die the movie begins with the mom death and the son moving in with his grandparents after couple stops along the son journey to manhood roommates progresses to the present day with the grandson surgeon and rocky in condemned house he refuses to leave the surgeon reluctantly offers the only possible solution rocky will have to move into his place the basement of building rented by group of chinese students communists the movie spans nine more years of rocky relationship with his grandson and the trials posed when the grandson meets and falls in love with gasp woman and starts spending all his time with her so in his grandson absence rocky turns his pursuits to professional boxing achieveing the world heavyweight title in climactic fight with apollo creed or am confusing movie plots again roommates has an almost epic feel to it covering several generations of family with one fiesty immigrant who refuses to die death though knocks at the door of almost every other major character in the the movie roommates has about as many casualties as the first halloween the number can be counted on one hand unless of course you re the victim of some hideous genetic mutation and you can probably guess who says farewell to planet earth at the end of the movie no not duran duran won come out and say it instead ll just sit here and hum eye of the tiger until each and every one of you figures it out roommates plays on all the major emotions it knows when to make you laugh and when to make you cry movies that can perfectly mix comedy and drama are always hits with the audience even though this one bombed at the theaters my point there are no absolutes or another possible point peter falk just isn such great box office draw either way this is still good movie and you should give it chance like did whether you hate your roommate or not
in 1987 the stock market crashed and oliver stone wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses wall street lucked out in its timing the recent crash gave the film resonation it might not of had and though its kill or be killed approach to business was exaggerated that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan era businessman stone constructed his film as mythical good vs evil tale relayed in the fast paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange critics and audiences lauded wall street elevating its status to that of contemporary classic proud to say that will never be counted as one of them found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone output with its thin caricatures obvious sentiments and charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen stone goes for broke in every scene the same could be said for nearly all of his works this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath heap of good intentions he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in plummeting airplane it all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity rather than explore what these situations are really like have feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative as they are presented in boiler room rather than laughably over the top these guys are salesmen after all not televised judges more than anything am baffled by why so many adore wall street the only possible solution can muster is its release date and not just the timeliness of the greed is good subject matter the film was plumped down in the eighties decade in which the one joke comedy rose to an art form and group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept low result movies in my mind the eighties will forever be remembered as decade with not only proliferation of bad movies but bad music bad hair and bad clothes maybe stone after school special set in wall street was viewed as welcome change of pace boiler room is an equally well timed film with some similarities to stone piece of crap they both feature consequential father son relationship though boiler room is much more subtle and touching and they are both concerned with the power of greed yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery smooth heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street boiler room is message movie as well though at least until the end doesn shove it in our faces boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash as said this film is indeed timely in society where who wants to be millionaire is the number one prime time show every day bringing about revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn been seen in quite while not only do we want to be millionaires we want to watch other people become millionaires in our super judgmental power oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything when you have money you have it all and seth giovanni ribisi wants it all the easy way he well intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm the kind that sells junk stock whereupon he meets others just like him ben affleck is cast as jim the company headhunter who struts in commanding the room like frat boy gordon gecko his job is to influence trainee into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving speech that subtly attacks their man hood it ironic that he sells these pups the same load of that they re told to dish out to prospective buyers affleck character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin similar character in glengary glen ross and that proves detrimental to the actor performance affleck shouts curses and be littles his rookie employees just like baldwin minus the edge when alec played the scene he became the part spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing really hammy line reading the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are intellectual gangsters they aren above rumble as test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes we drink up this world along with seth and watch him become seduced by it just like we might be as in all cautionary tales boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness know this story we all do but it can work if it told with intelligence and energy and that is how writer director ben younger tells it as director of please excuse my french mise en scene younger has much to learn his style is sitcom bland but his writing isn younger script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch his dialogue is like junior david mamet despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script the brokers hucksters counter every customer objection gently bullying them into buying stock these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes tense confrontation between victimizer and victim who isn aware that he is one with the exception of affleck brief appearances the performances are truly exceptional ribisi who has the edgy looks of character actor is extremely potent here working his pale angular face and eerie plaintive stare for all their worth he conveys child like vulnerability his character seems to hide in corner whenever things aren going his way in some scenes and in others he ferociously cut throat the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie ribisi is confident when it just him and the phone but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father authoritatively played by ron rifkin boiler room thankfully avoids wall street like histrionics in the sales pitch sequences the sales build slowly like crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys those ploys are taught to seth by chris vin diesel kind broker who alternates between seth friend and his mentor diesl shines in his minor role this week saw the sci fi opus pitch siyah in which diesel plays completely different role in an equally effective manner in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80 and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70 nicky katt is also memorable as superior broker obsessed with what he can have nia long as the firm secretary lone siyah women amongst many beyaz men is ribisi love interest in part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets but develops into something more interesting the two make an oddly likeable couple long is smart and brash and ribisi is charmingly aloof at one point he says to her just lookin for some chocolate love it terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child like way it becomes sweetly endearing unfortunately towards the end the boiler room turns tad schmaltzy there is much crying hugging and sorrowful stares this is okay when taken in small doses but younger conclusion is constructed as series of these boo hoo moments one following the other particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth manipulations have on one of his poor victims it not bad idea but the execution is lacking with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message that message being greed is bad yes it patently obvious but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to culture that haven seen much of in the movies the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur and all wall street did was introduce us to simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners boiler room offers neither extreme it gives us what is in between and for that am thankful
look back at all the times in your life when there was fork in the path to the future some sort of decision had to be made and for better or worse it irrevocably altered the course of your existence >from time to time everyone thinks about the roads not taken and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how seemingly minor action catching the 10 am train for example could have an equally profound yet less obvious impact maybe that where you met your significant other and had you reached the platform just few seconds later film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else and that why there no shortage of movies about this subject the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance these themes weave their way through many of his movies including decalogue the double life of veronique and the triptych of mavi beyaz and kirmizi however they are most explicitly examined in 1981 film called blind chance where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after minor action missing or catching train changes the course of his life in his autobiography kieslowski on kieslowski the director describes his attraction to the concept this way [the idea is] rich and interesting that every day we re faced with choice which could end our entire life yet of which we re completely unaware while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films including in way frank capra it wonderful life sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths the road not taken approach isn just plot device either writer director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of character after she just misses catches train the audience watches with ever growing fascination how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life her future career where she lives whom she loves and whether she has family as her separate destinies diverge and then re converge she becomes two completely different individuals that woman is helen played by gwyneth paltrow as long dark haired brit one day after losing her job as an advertising executive she decides to return home in the middle of the day the scene of the pivotal moment is train platform in scenario #1 she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station on board she meets the cheerful talkative james john hannah monty python fan who is taken with her beauty minutes later in her flat she walks in on her lover gerry john lynch in bed with another woman jeanne tripplehorn in scenario #2 she misses the train and shortly thereafter is the victim of an attempted mugging she doesn meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry infidelity juxtaposed one against the other while sharing many places cues and characters the two stories proceed in parallel from there on one level for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate sliding doors can be viewed as deep and wonderful experience but for those who just appreciate romantic comedy characterized by solid acting script with few twists and great deal of genuinely funny material sliding doors still fits the bill one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures and those who could care less it shouldn come as any surprise that the acting at least from three of the four leads is solid paltrow who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same yet gradually become much different is the standout she plays both of her roles effectively and believably the shy insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated platinum blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on new career with new man john hannah known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and funeral is instantly likable john lynch taking break from movies about ireland troubles does good job presenting gerry as inept selfish philanderer only jeanne tripplehorn who plays an over the top vixen seems out of place her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring and it occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than plot element one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice douglas mcferran who plays gerry best friend russell is an absolute delight stealing every scene that he in part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie on one occasion he has marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into life of monogamy on another occasion while laughing at gerry plight with the women in his life he comments being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable but it not all in the dialogue mcferran tears into this part with relish his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of top notch comedy this is the first feature film for peter howitt and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb the script is shrewd and inventive combining wit romance and intelligent melodrama into crowd pleasing whole sliding doors grants more than just good time at the movies however for those who are so inclined its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe all while having good time
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned east meets west in mulan the latest installment in disney parade of annual animated feature films an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass market commercial sensibilities this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years but falls short of actualizing its potential though not for lack of trying in many respects mulan is among disney most mature efforts skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized the imagery of pillaged village neatly encapsulated in the form of child discarded doll is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars and mulan later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy bloodless method imaginable yet how often does hollywood animated film long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such provocative manner in an instant idealistic mulan innocence is lost and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending the film based upon an ancient chinese fable centers on spirited young woman who disguises herself as man in order to serve as her family obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger edged teeth although lent surprisingly genuine sense of menace dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western european fables and literature for decades disney new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere story intact to some neutral territory and revels in its east asian roots aside from predominantly asian american cast providing the film vocal work there liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes invoking pseudo asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary and can imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors really included karate chopping blocks of stone in two it rather remarkable that movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately it startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan land at its core the film is tale of heroic adventure and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour perseverance nobility and courage as such animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand in hand with visual purity scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action such as mulan venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice are lent sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments particularly during our heroine character defining opening half hour it when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation the friendly animal sidekick the colourful array of supporting characters into the mix where it goes slightly awry off to battle mulan finds herself being trailed by jive talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little lucky cricket who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience friendly comic relief they re affable presences and not precisely ineffective reasonable amounts of humour are elicited and eddie murphy who voices mushu is amusingly earnest but amidst all the high melodrama the effect is mildly jarring and from storytelling perspective questionable in its necessity at training camp mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over trio of fumbling recruits easily characterized simply as the short clown the skinny clown and the big clown who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness and in familiar retread of traditional disney patterns she grows certain fondness for handsome square jawed young captain shang everybody needs love even ancient chinese warrior princesses but not necessarily in this film the romantic angle which lets the air out of the sails of the story neo feminist underpinnings lacks any genuine spark and plays out like contractual obligation another staple of recent disney animated films cache of hummable little ditties has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be decided weakness composed by matthew wilder none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing and one ll make man out of you unimaginatively accompanying tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable only reflections an early ballad of lament proves to be song of any consequence serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga one of musical theatre most wondrously pure voices nonetheless mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory with strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork the computer generated stampede of hun warriors charging down snow mountain is wholly impressive while the blatantly child friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film they re not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable briskly paced with smart energetic heroine and filled with high adventure the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter
capsule bleak and point blank just the way it should be makes its case with cold blooded precision and intelligence serial killer chic is relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary and one of the more stomach turning ones ve never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers and because of that had apprehensions about seeing henry wasn sure wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero antihero thankfully that not the way henry works the director john mcnaughton took small budget and gallery of actor friends and created chilling and intelligent piece of work it doesn provide cheap jack explanations for henry behavior it shows him up for what he is an unrepentant and un idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him at the film opening henry friend ottis toole has sister who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago in viciously riveting scene he admits matter of factly to having murdered his own mother and she covers his hand with hers they are damned together from that moment on henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it there scene where the two go to buy new tv the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with soldering iron no preface it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker in scene which many damned the movie for unseen they steal video camera and film the murder of whole household playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment the movie itself however does not glorify the killings but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work only irritation henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame just standing there and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well the producers had originally comissioned slasher film from mcnaughton but he decided to give them something more memorable and consequently the film nearly didn see release the film does not glorify or justify it just shows us with unflinching coldness what henry was hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of victim or hero then again probably so would henry
field of dreams almost defies description although it about baseball it not baseball movie although the film is extremely spiritual it not about religion and although field of dreams is melodramatic it not tearjerker to really understand what field of dreams is all about you have to see it in the film kevin costner plays ray kinsella baseball fan 60s berkeley graduate and iowa farmer one day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields ray hears voice it tells him if you build it he will come then ray has vision and somehow concludes that if he builds baseball field in the middle of his corn shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again and even though it depletes his family savings and his neighbors think he crazy ray clears away the corn and builds baseball field complete with bleachers and flood lights if you build it he will come and lo and behold shoeless joe does come bringing with him several of his dead teammates and then ray hears the voice again it tells him to ease his pain ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann an influential and radical novelist from the 60s who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society with great aplomb james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray and embarks with him on magical and spiritual journey the cast in field of dreams is excellent especially kevin costner in the lead role costner gives quiet subtle and moving performance as man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale amy madigan gives fine supporting performance as ray feisty and loving wife who against her better judgement supports her husband crazy ideas in her most impressive scene madigan vehemently argues against book burning at meeting displaying the sincere passion of 60s berkeley radical ray liotta is appropriately eerie and awe inspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the 1919 chicago siyah sox scandal and finally burt lancaster is memorable in small but important role as small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only one inning field of dreams is touching fairy tale full of life wonder mystery spirit and humor it for the most part succeeds in capturing our emotions and suspending our disbelief ray kinsella spiritual quest in pursuit of his dreams proves to be moving and miraculous but while field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama it unfortunately does at times go overboard and by the end it gets down right sappy in general however field of dreams is an emotionally satisfying fantasy one can recommend to everyone but unromantic cynics
let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film really wasn looking forward to it as much as have with some of the previous films not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film by that point it was evident that mr bond was back with vengeance all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren exactly pleasant experience it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts it took reminder from an audience member to clue them in guess they can be excused though taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain anyway after somebody remembered what the light switch was for settled in for bond think the most noticeable aspect of this the 19th film in the series is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films there were probably more one liners in this movie than in the last several combined and bond last one liner in the film is about the best of the series the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 for the most part the action sequences worked very well although there were couple of times that thought some things were bit over the top even for bond film think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted while he did good job for the most part there were points in the movie specifically during action sequences that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film most noticeably sequences on snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie he almost seemed like he didn know what he was doing but they were brief scenes and really shouldn take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing if you have ever seen bond film you won be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit the world is not enough is no exception this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world 007 matches wits with the terrorist renard robert carlyle man who has bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain why this point is included is beyond me they took great pains to explain his condition but it only came up later in the movie as scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought anyway renard like the typical terrorist that he is is bent on some harebrained scheme involving mid east oil pipeline guess world domination just isn as attractive to terrorists as money making venture anymore bond is brought in to protect the pipeline owner elektra king sophie marceau who is the daughter of one of renard recent victims along the way bond has to enlist the help of nuclear scientist dr christmas jones denise richards and his old rival valentin zukovsky robert carlyle like all bond films you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot since it is ridiculous beyond words my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films there was at least one point that had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing the buddy that saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau character it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly although not included in the film later it became big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something but because it is bond film the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly after all it isn shakespeare how about the cast brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 grew up with the roger moore version of bond so really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character judi dench as had bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie coltrane gets more screen time which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes then there are the bond girls sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her natural to play the innocent victim those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just pretty face marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play bond love interest then we have denise richards there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks and after you see the outfits she wears you won have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer eyes was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did good job playing nuclear scientist admittedly there was one point that the audience snickered bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue but other than that she stacks up no pun intended to her bond girl predecessors nicely must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle character while carlyle did fine job with the material that he had his character just never worked for me the producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character but it just never quite got off the ground guess was hoping for bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character this might have worked well in another movie but don go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations last but not least we have desmond llewelyn as this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond gadget guy and he is as good as ever although his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films he is still treat to watch rumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role he says future appearances are up to higher power the producers have introduced his protege and future replacement bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese while we don see much of him in this film think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn legacy whenever it is passed on will be in very capable hands so how does it stack up despite some problems the world is not enough is very entertaining movie and all things considered what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies this is easily the best of the brosnan films it may even be the best of the entire series certainly in the top one thing is for sure even after 19 movies there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series here looking forward to bond number 20
titantic writer and director james cameron much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 000 000 epic arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises whether the film is worth it as business proposition it seems hard to see how it can ever break even but as movie it is nothing short of wonderful if you ve already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie la volcano or the poseidon adventure think again the movie is both great love story told with the disaster as backdrop and portrayal of one of the world most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers in either case it is filmmaking at its best when we entered the press screening my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and quarter hours long he said no but that the time would go by so fast she never notice the length amazingly he was right titanic is one of the few long films that doesn suffer because of it the lush picture filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean fortune hunter brock lovett bill paxton leads the expedition looking for the world most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship known back then as the ship of dreams the necklace hundred year old former owner rose dewitt bukater gloria stuart finds brock to tell him her story although almost all of the movie happens in flashback one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk using computer simulation the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later which adds immensely to making lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing after twenty minutes the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage in classic movie theme the two parts of the ship first class and steerage third class exist in sharp contrast the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance cal hockley played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane and thanks to last minute winning poker hand an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into little shared cabin in third class even with her own promenade deck rose feels trapped on the ship what with an upcoming marriage to man she loathes in contrast jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board after jack saves rose from committing suicide they start brief but impassioned love affair never tawdry and rarely explicit their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma in so many ways small and large he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part when he confronts cal for example he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal supercilious put downs kate winslet gives wonderfully captivating performance as young rose the chemistry between these two academy award nominees him for what eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility is nothing short of astonishing from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude they dazzle the screen with pair of mesmerizing performances if the film breaks after an hour and half which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up you will still get one of the best films of the year peter lamont sets are more than authentic one scene for example starts with the planning to retire captain played with insouciance by bernard hill having his tea on deck it then shifts to the ship massive gears and then to the bright hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble palace more than an ocean liner easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest at first since the iceberg tears series of little gashes in the hull not some big gaping hole the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else what lark we ve struck an iceberg now let get back to our brandy and cigars the ship musicians play like troopers through it all even after the panic sets in after all they see it as their duty to calm the passengers when the musicians are about to die they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together and they mean it their civility borders on insanity but it is touching nevertheless the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface there are more than enough characters to love and to hate and all of the casting is dead on special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable in titanic for which he created nine tenths scale model of the entire ship cameron strove for accuracy at all costs the most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two and the front section becomes vertical in the water people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately besides being romantic and dramatic the script includes liberal doses of humor from the many deliciously subtle verbal put downs to the physical comedy as when jack teaches rose to spit like man the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps few tears it good bye for little while less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first this boat for mommies and children there ll be boat in little while for daddies basically there was design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats it made the decks look too crowded otherwise perhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim on board the ship in the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink he is offered life jacket by one of the crew no thanks the elegantly attired guggenheim replies we re dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen but we would like brandy titanic runs 14 it is rated pg 13 for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up
remember making pact right after `patch adams to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality but darn it `music of the heart is just layered with feel good material and bright characterizations it hard to dislike movie that uses such skill with it manipulation in addition it also terrific family film this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in handful of inner city harlem schools it could also be described as `mrs streep opus yes meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari and that brings both good news and bad out of the gate possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta character and grasp her academic point of view she is very strict with her students but what insight does that create into the story slowly but surely we begin to recognize the intentions of the character and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied one thoroughly interesting fact about `music of the heart lies with the unlikely presence in the director chair horror veteran wes craven after leaving an impression with the `scream films and the original `nightmare on elm street craven has attempted precarious cross over to drama at first his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious but as the film progresses craven finds surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material it doesn carry the heart warming courage of `mr holland opus but `music of the heart is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate yes oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep but it the solid ensemble cast that makes `music of the heart work angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn hire roberta because of her lack of experience blue eyed adian quinn is endearing as always playing new love interest gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of supportive second grade teacher and the three lead actresses together produce flaming fireball of estrogenic force it like schoolteacher version of `thelma and louise in restrained but effective manner the movie tackles more issues than just guaspari teaching of violin there some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman in it dramatic build up the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth it good movie for anyone to see although missing out on the experience would not be life altering decision it commendable of wes craven to be attempting such difficult cross over and also for achieving his intricate goal watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments who may ask yourself this is the guy who directed `scream of course when the third installment of that series comes around in february 2000 with craven directing you may find yourself wondering this is the guy who directed `music of the heart mission accomplished wes thankfully there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film in it entirety it wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile the child actors are cute and perform up to par even if some of their problems are clich and predictable in the extreme the mother who doesn want her son to be learning `white man music the unexpected casuality basically everything is there it doesn strike the perfect chord but `music of the heart is highly convincing the uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better but `music of the heart is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals
vannesa kensington `austin do you smoke after sex austin powers `i don know baby ve never looked and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season austin powers the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997 is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity the mind of mike myers is obviously very bizarre place myers returns as the swinging 60 spy and his arch nemesis the bald headed dr evil who is given much of the spotlight here there an early scene in which dr evil and his son scott seth green appear on jerry springer segment entitled `my dad is evil and wants to take over the world hosted by springer himself most of these talk show gags spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee are no longer as funny as they once were happily this is an exception especially when fight breaks out between dr evil and the other guests sample dialogue `come back here you mother #@%$^ you want piece of me the audience was in stitches there are many good things about this sequel dr evil is now assisted by mini me verne troyer pint sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry mini me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for and troyer does terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does pinkie and all mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina evil loud mouth assassin sidekick and here we are treated to brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber this works surprisingly well afterward there even meeting at the coffee machine where their awkwardness is expressed in scene you would expect in any normal office environment oh yes the plot after short honeymoon with vanessa kensington elizabeth hurley that goes disastrously wrong powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr evil in the original the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods here it time travel dr evil has this crazy plan to steal austin mojo the source of his sexual powers so he jumps through time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber there he employs grotesque 600 pound scottish assassin named fat bastard also myers to commandeer the mojo so that our future hero is left completely shagless meanwhile austin is informed of evil wrong doing by basil exposition michael york and is supplied with his very own time traveling device in the form of volkswagen beetle once back in 1969 powers meets foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell heather graham and learns of dr evil plans to destroy washington dc with lazer on the moon in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars evil calls the moon base `death star if there ever was movie that knew from the start it was complete joke it austin powers the spy who shagged me ap2 has many hilarious moments much more so than the original austin powers but what it doesn have is the confident support system that the first boasted and the jokes are now more scattershot and hit and miss while myers has knack for delivering clever inspired gags he sometimes doesn know when to call it quits the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa will ferrell and his refusal to die is played out here in disappointing and tired manner robert wagner as dr evil #2 man has only one scene early on in the film where he lacks all the focus of the character one nice surprise is rob lowe as the young #2 who patterns wagner voice and movements right down to tee there are more recycled jokes from the predecessor including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project and many bits are side splittingly funny don miss an extended visual gag in tent where the shadows leave much to the imagination of the new characters graham doesn leave much of an impression her performance is merely okay and she lacks the gung ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her and as for fat bastard well he provides one or two hilarious moments but all of the obesity jokes and bathroom talk go too far but my most severe complaint mr bigglesworth was only in one scene but with gritted teeth managed to get over that this sequel will not leave fans disappointed it more often than not laugh riot and look optimistically to the future where foresee more installments to the austin powers collection if myers can up the quota of fresh ideas we should be in store for much more 1999 jamey hughton jamey hughton 15 has written weekly column in the starphoenix saskatoon sk since november 1997 he was 1999 writing finalist in the canadian ytv achievement awards
you know you re in for truly different cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movie in question most normal character such is the case with the big lebowski joel and ethan coen first venture since their fargo nabbed nationwide acclaim and mantlepiece of academy award nods there no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment because lebowski is an effort that makes words like strange and unusual seem like an understatement thanks in part to delicious characterization and an all encompassing sense of humor the film is smashing success the central oddball here is the dude jeff bridges an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot drinking beer and going bowling are you college students already rooting for him or what one night pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet threatening act that supposed to be carried out against famous pasadena millionaire david huddleston who shares his birth name jeff lebowski with the dude once the dude realizes this coincidence he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter john goodman hotheaded vietnam vet and donny buscemi mild mannered surfer before too long soon though lebowski trampy trophy wife bunny tara reid is kidnaped and held for hefty ransom and he turns to the dude for help it seems bunny troubles are related to line of work she kept secret from her husband she actually an adult film star and is very in debt with shady producer named jackie treehorn the dude now on lebowski payroll accepts the offer and agrees to handle the money drop walter tags along and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself chaos obviously ensues and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops crooks and lebowski ultra eccentric artist daughter maude julianne moore the big lebowski deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that fargo did while that 1996 siyah comedy was certainly better film lebowski is at least as breathtakingly imaginative the movie boasts mile high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over but thankfully never does the coens joel directed ethan produced and both wrote keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale and must be commended for juggling number of people and subplots one would expect to find in robert altman flick whether we re watching bridges fend off marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in busby berkeley esque dream sequence the big lebowski is immensely lively there are those who will dislike this film but not because it boring the cast has great deal of fun with the bounteous material they re given bridges exudes likeable surprisingly sweet presence his dude sure isn the cleanest guy around but you still follow him to another movie goodman merits 1998 first oscar consideration as walter manic temper is one of the big lebowski many highlights the same goes for moore whose throaty delectable performance as maude is hilarious hoot john turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as colorful bowler from rival faction sam elliott rambling narration gets the film off to solid start and some will recognize peter stormare fargo silent heavy as carl hungus porn star who really samurai sword wielding german nihilist and has been pop star only in its final third does the movie falter with couple of loose plot threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for curtain call these flaws are forgivable though the coens have crafted tale so rich with personality that it hard to look at the final product with anything but big grin on your face without doubt the big lebowski is the best film so far this year sure we re only three months in and the competition deep rising desperate measures the wedding singer etc has been pretty bland but it still the gospel truth maybe during next awards season lebowski won be far cry from fargo

tempe mills cinema az this movie had us in non stop stitches from beginning to end all those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie if you thought they were funny see the rest of the movie it hilarious how does one go about making movie about couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head bopping on snl to exactly one song easy write an interesting script around tried and true ideas add some good lines and satire and voil you end up with an excellent well done very entertaining flick will and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day at night they pursue their life long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills ca the only disco act worth going to the only problem the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door the roxbury closes all the while bearing witness to guys with one hundred dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss the script authors steve koren will ferrell and chris kattan cleverly devised way for our boys to get into the roxbury their flower shop van is rear ended by richard grieco who fears law suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star struck to think about the car accident they just had but not about getting into the roxbury grieco happily takes them in even introduces them to the owner which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of couple of altin diggers elisa donovan and gigi rice who bet their time and bodies on will and chris what follows are some of the best slap stick dancing routines ever the music is superb and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez born to be alive the choreography at times was parody of an era gone by for example the bee gees and their stayin alive it is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back and the technique is clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump one of the funniest scenes is when the altin diggers discover that will and chris don have any mone and dump both on the spot even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away an art imitates life poke at shallow women it scene that an approximate parody of the vinegar own rolf luedeke editorial this week national organization for men nom replaces now ted unabomber kaczynski himself rejected for not having money will identify well with this scene if he ever watches the movie of course the script wouldn be complicated enough without adding molly shannon the girl next door who has had crush on will since they were kids and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good looking disco blondes proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby nevertheless will father wants him to marry molly anyway but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guest quarter exile during the wedding ceremony will heart isn exactly into getting married and when his brother appears on the balcony with ghetto blaster and more head bopping music will thinks worse of the knot tieing idea and runs to chris definitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony found this scene riot however it went over brandi head she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared the scene has good punch line when molly shannon marries instead the step in buddy weight lifter who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy and who has been lusting for good looker for long time but ready now to take anyone more art imitates life stuff not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world the idiots mother is played by loni anderson whose barbie doll looks don play well anymore she bit old and whose cleavage looks like someone botched tracheotomy too low down recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have lot of fun or in need of lot of laughs go with date brandi laughed non stop as did and deaf mute might have concluded was tickling her continuously for 105 minutes
fritz lang first american film since leaving nazi germany is an eye opener about lynch mob in small town joe wilson spencer tracy is regular joe hard working stiff decent guy who is living with his two brothers tom walcott and charlie albertson in chicago he is engaged to katherine grant sylvia sidney but can save up enough money to marry her she takes the train west for better paying job as teacher before she departs she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother sews up his ripped trench coat corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento and kisses him goodbye year goes by and joe buys car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city that he has quit his job and hopes to open gas station driving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her he arrives at near by town called strand but the deputy sheriff buggs meyers walter brennan comes upon him waving shotgun and arrests him he accuses him of the kidnapping of little girl the sheriff ellis finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket he also has five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money and he fits the general description of the suspect locked in jail he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence in the local bar the town citizens go into rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping fueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect mob storms the jail burns it down and dynamites it when they can get through to the prisoner jail cell the sheriff called the governor for the national guard but one of his political advisers countermanded that request saying it wouldn look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him somehow joe escapes but his dog rainbow dies katherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell and becomes convinced that he died the next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses joe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers who are startled to see him alive that he wants revenge he thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob an ambitious district attorney walter abel prosecutes the 22 for murder katherine not knowing he alive remains in state of shock but is asked to be witness that she saw joe burning to death the defense claims that it can be charge of murder without corpse the trial proves to be interesting as the citizens in this close knit respectable community lie under oath providing alibis for each other to prove they couldn have been at the jail the sheriff also lies saying he can identify anyone in the mob but proof comes by way of newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film as for proof of the corpse an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe in the note memento is misspelled which makes katherine realize that joe is alive when the sentence is announced 20 of the accused are found guilty of murder but joe marches into the courtroom and gives pious speech about what happened katherine forgives him and this very strong film ends on weaker note than think it should have but don blame lang for all the changes in the film of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive mgm couldn bear to have it made the way lang wanted it that is by having tracy die in the lynching instead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script to lang credit even if this film failed to be masterpiece because of the interference it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised you couldn help get the feeling that the citizens didn care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their 22 vigilantes from going to jail even perjuring themselves their reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they weren going to be convicted lang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident he does imply that dark side to joe wilson has been exposed and the innocent jovial good guy seen in the beginning of the film has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience
mars attacks 1996 jack nicholson glenn close annette bening martin short danny devito rod steiger pierce brosnan sarah jessica parker michael fox jim brown pam grier joe don baker natalie portman christina applegate lisa marie tom jones this is director tim burton finest film to date many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day but even though the stories are similar they really are two distinctly different films however as whole mars attacks is much more entertaining than id4 and loved id4 you really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film it is completely wacked out and unlike anything you ve ever seen once the silly tone of the film is set it easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just don mix the plot is simple martians invade the earth but it different than any other invasion film usually it the evil aliens versus the heroic humans this time however it the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans the martians who are all computer generated are just about the funniest things ve seen in long time they look funny they move funny and their language is hilarious and about the special effects the effects in mars attacks are just about the most flawless ones ve seen to date the computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem 100% real there are just couple of scenes that don work mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship also glenn close overacts tremendously in her thankfully very limited screen time so much so that actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise but there are many big laughs in the film as said if you are in the right mood could it have been funnier certainly was it funny enough yes was entertained absolutely on personal note like to thank whomever cast rod steiger my favorite actor in the film as war crazy general decker finally after many very small parts in direct to video garbage and minor tv roles steiger is back on the big screen in real movie that many people will see while he not given the type of role that you can give real performance in he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue the preview audience saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him
seen february 15 1998 on home video borrowed from chris wessell when it comes to modern gangster movies it really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and or just using the word routine ve always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea no matter how many times it been used before can provide for good story and donnie brasco clinches this idea it not unlike most of the great films of the genre yet it never apes another style as it has good layer of authenticity even if its core is tad stale the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it we meet lefty pacino an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this somehow he comes across donnie brasco depp younger guy with lot of spunk who isn afraid of lefty and his rep and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him it clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately telling him all the tricks of the trade have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit however we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone an fbi agent working undercover character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as newcomer the first act works as guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor brief history of the mob definitions of their slang and where their money comes from and who it goes to the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements however the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works probably from watching other gangster movies and although this attitude comes across the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable thankfully the film doesn become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime and instead opts for character development much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any mavi collar worker would he old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be we learn of his accomplishments which are quite impressive within their context and when he complains about not being made top boss it easy to sympathize with him newell constantly plays up this aspect making it major theme which works well in the long run as donnie is constantly impressing and even one upping lefty it hard to tell which emotion is more powerful the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed most of the film tells the story of donnie life in mafia which creates for many sub plots and individual conflicts but doesn always seem to come together as whole the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar the resonance to donnie actual assignment varies he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress but it doesn always seem to have much meaning back home his wife maggie heche is ready to divorce him because he never and the family is suffering since this is based on true story wouldn doubt this would happen although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act or at least any real sense of closure climax of sorts does occur but there little feeling of payoff we get happy ending which is good but perhaps sad ending would have been more powerful aside from few minor general flaws donnie brasco manages to be solid piece of storytelling and character development it may be routine but it good and that respectful
let face it since waterworld floated by the summer movie season has grown very stale with no new eye candy for four weeks straight we ve had to sustain ourselves on the quasi nutritional value of cheatin husbands traveling chocolate salesmen and computer generated serial killers sigh thank god for desperado the freewheeling sequel to el mariachi director robert rodriguez notorious $7000 debut stars cool antonio banderas as the returning guitarist with no name he man in siyah with revenge on his mind and an arsenal in his case the woman he loved was killed in the first film so he spends the entire story shooting drug dealers sort of tex mex version of the punisher if you will there isn much of an emotional core to desperado rodriguez is having too much fun finding new and innovative ways to pay homage to john woo and sergio leone and sam peckinpah some may wince at the body count at least 100 graphic killings is fair estimate but it all played for laughs big broad hispanic laughs that for me recall the physical comedy of blake edwards and his pink panther films sick slick fun
bruce lee was bigger than life martial artist and actor bruce unique character self produced sound effects etc and seemingly perfected martial art and physique were all well portrayed by the actor james lee the story is told from his wife linda point of view where she put lot of family and practical side of bruce lee life however you can help but like whenever the fight scenes are on what he can does with his body and that familiar bruce attitude and character also like the little bits of insight scenes about bruce lee life before he became famous scenes like bruce practicing pronunciation of english it seemed as if he was no better than anybody else scenes like bruce delivering chinese food as delivery boy ridding bike through the american college looking at the all white students cheerleaders and athletes it seemed he too wished for the american dreams and hopes in conclusion the movie was well made it produced realization of who bruce lee was and actor james lee was so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor and the fighting scenes were all excellent so go see it and enjoy the movie if you have seen the movie unforgiven by clint eastwood then the feeling left after dragon was very much like the feeling you got after the unforgiven
robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible god given gifts but are able to act like ordinary people in the natural 1984 he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs the baseball player who was destined to be the best there ever was but still acted like humble farm boy in butch cassidy and the sundance kid 1969 he was the most dangerous shot in the west yet he came off like nothing more than boyishly good looking charmer even in indecent proposal 1993 where he played man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency especially when reciting tale of lost love in his latest film the horse whisperer based on the best selling novel by nicholas evans redford again plays such character redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in movie suppose the character of tom booker man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses was just too good to pass up despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses magazine article coins the phrase horse whisperer to describe his uncanny talent booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having purpose in life booker talents are taxed into service by annie maclean kristin scott thomas new york magazine editor whose daughter grace scarlett johansson was recently in horrible accident the accident which is filmed with gut wrenching horror happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses an eighteen wheeler kills grace friend severely wounds and traumatizes grace horse pilgrim and causes grace to lose part of her right leg annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed grace will be healed as well which leads her to booker at first she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse but that doesn work instead she packs up grace and pilgrim leaves her husband robert sam neill behind and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs ranch with his brother frank chris cooper and his sister in law diane dianne wiest in many ways the film is like journey both literally and symbolically the move out west has always been great american tradition of renewal and it hard not to see annie and grace leaving manhattan for montana as variation on the classic theme of city vs country in the horse whisperer country is clearly the victor the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide open spaces of montana that grace anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate annie controlling nature begins to relax and pilgrim once again learns to trust people redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed river runs through it six years ago in many ways the horse whisperer comes from the same poetic vein as river and the movie could probably be good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera time on the grass and mountains but then that would ruin the magic much of the film photography is truly elegant and it creates palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land to further emphasize this redford and cinematographer robert richardson natural born killers platoon cheated bit by shooting the beginning of the film which takes place in new york with mostly cold harsh bluish filters and more squarish 85 aspect ratio when the action shifts to montana richardson switches to soft focus and natural lighting and the screen widens to 35 aspect ratio in terms of the story itself the horse whisperer gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean brief encounter 1945 and clint eastwood 1995 adaptation of robert james waller the bridges of madison county richard lagravenese co screenwriter here also adapted bridges although the horse whisperer has strong romantic sensibility still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who being left behind for this brief heart sweeping affair but there rarely is in the horse whisperer the thankless role of being the fuddy duddy husband falls to sam neill he plays the character as decent hard working man who is good husband and father his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away but simply because he happens to be normal fairly uninspiring man there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character it shows booker and robert going into horse pen booker is dressed like classic cowboy with hat and all while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out of place in baseball cap as they enter the pen booker assuredly swings over the fence while robert hesitates then opens the gate and in goofy moment forgets to close it behind him it small scene but it clearly demonstrates the movie thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness after all booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it the best scenes in the horse whisperer tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie but rather the healing process of grace and her horse although booker horse training methods are mythical and unrealistic the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace some of which are humorous and all of which are tender and true at some point wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more nevertheless redford is obviously romantic at heart and he brings light touch to the erotic moments in the film there are no dramatic sex scenes but there is moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow dancing always moving ever closer together that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character there are enough moments like that which make the horse whisperer worth the price of admission
every once in while when an exceptional family film comes along will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children it is remarkable how many non disney films disappear in couple of weeks now see that in so doing have unfairly ghettoized these films so am issuing my challenge not just to parents but to anyone who wants to support smart funny energetic film making see matilda see it in theater rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video see the best film have seen in 1996 not the best children film the best film period based on story by roald dahl it tells of young matilda wormwood mara wilson an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have pair of deeply stupid parents harry danny devito crooked used car salesman and zinnia rhea perlman simple minded bingo addict the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists and when they do it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books when they finally do send her to school it is to crunchem hall bleak place run by cruel child hating miss agatha trunchbull pam ferris but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers sympathetic teacher miss honey embeth davidtz who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness matilda also discovers another special talent the ability to move things with her mind which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull cruelty it was this spring james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than hint of darkness to them and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton matilda soars on the cock eyed direction of danny devito devito made siyah humor key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses and he contributes some memorable images in one scene an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig tails and flung through the air like throwing hammer later an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing dessert matilda is just twisted enough to be perfect fairy tale it is also characteristic of the best children tales that they manage to teach lessons in such way that children almost don realize that they are learning them there is hilarious moment when matilda television addicted father snatches away the book she is reading in wicked joke he thinks _moby dick_ is pornographic and forces her to watch an inane game show hosted by jon lovitz in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in booth filled with cash blowing around matilda is story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for child that because big and you re little right and you re wrong more specifically it has as its heroine an intelligent self confident girl who struggles successfully against other people notions of how she should behave it is no coincidence that matilda was co written by robin swicord who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women finally matilda has that quality find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word devito knows enough to make matilda fast paced and appealing to children taking deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy including great chase through her dark house the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable with mara wilson making matilda clever and extremely likeable character but there are also many many delights for adults including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on chalkboard by itself while matilda classmates recite in sing song fashion there is also deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda father can imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted matilda is film which left me glowing with good feeling will see it again and years from now will watch it with my children and now will stop because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin and there is seat in that theater you should be in if you have child or ever were child
labelling is sometimes everything in original mad max the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future thus making it one of the science fiction classics despite the future world being almost exactly like our own walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors producers weren thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones on the other hand producers were right on the mark walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america to make the movie even more distant from future plot was loosely based on anabasis historical book written by xenophon greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago instead of ancient persia movie begins in contemporary coney island where cleon dorsey wright leader of the warriors local youth gang gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city the gathering organised by gramercy park riffs most powerful gang in the city is taking place in bronx that is far away from warriors home territory but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce on the gathering cyrus roger hill charismatic leader of the riffs announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city crowd is enthusiastic but the small gang of rogues led by psychopathic luther david patrick kelly uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus police simultaneously raids the gathering and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing and their leader gets killed by riffs the remaining eight led by cleon lieutenant swann michael beck must now try to get to coney island but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs upon its release despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of cult status however despite being one of the best movies of that year and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year the reason for that probably lies in fact that this movie aged very quickly if walter hill idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america he failed miserably the future was much worse than his vision the youth gangs as presented in the warriors are far from shadowy armies able to take over entire cities their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic and for the public more annoying matters like crime in their vocabulary word arms is reserved for small knives and blunt objects and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns they even have their own very strict and detailed laws upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had lot arguments in their favour despite those objections the warriors have all the elements of very good film the plot is simple and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic although there isn much bloodshed or gore in the movie editing is superb events happen at quick pace with the exception of middle when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would be girlfriend mercy deborah van valkenburgh drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable yet the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent although most of them later sunk into anonymity best known of them is david patrick kelly whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains michael beck as cool almost statesman like leader of gang is also very good and james remar gives good contrast as his hot shot contender for top spot all in all this movie is perhaps dated yet in its hour and half can give lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies
in _daylight_ sylvester stallone breaks no new ground cinematically speaking but he covers familiar territory quite well yesterday as was going about my business in the university bookstore noticed this stand with these _daylight_ movie posters on it had never heard of the movie so stopped by to check it out it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering so shrugged thought hey they probably won give me the card anyway and could always use free movie so signed up all in all don think got that bad of deal either rob cohen who has previously brought us such films as _dragon the bruce lee story_ and more recently _dragonheart_ gee wonder if he likes dragons for some reason you think now brings us very nicely executed disaster picture with fx by industrial light and magic about the after effects of an explosion that collapses busy tunnel between new york and new jersey sylvester stallone plays kit latura who is essentially carbon copy of the character he played in _cliffhanger_ paramedic on the outs because he made mistake that got people killed when the crisis hits he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out there are other similarities to _cliffhanger_ too perhaps the only real difference is that _cliffhanger_ had villain where _daylight_ bad guy is mother nature in fact had the two movies been made in hong kong this might have been titled _cliffhanger ii_ it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film sequels do to their predecessors the first half hour of _daylight_ is setup subplots are woven and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled we meet all the important people toxic waste disposal truck drivers young frustrated jilted rejected playwright family struggling to stay together an older couple and their dog truckload of prisoners an ad agency executive tunnel police officer stallone and others we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons and then thirty minutes into the film _boom_ and it big one >from there on in it sly stallone to the rescue and rescue he does enduring batterings beatings falls repeated immersion in 34 degree water explosions mud rats and constant setbacks before going on to save the day sly style again there nothing new here and yet there doesn need to be the fun of _daylight_ is not in the story but in the execution the special effects are first rate thanks to industrial light and magic and the ensemble cast works well together once the film hits its stride it carries the viewer right along to the finish with very few jars along the way this review is copyright 1996 by christopher meadows permission granted for distribution through rec arts movies reviews and all associated archival permission granted for free redistribution via cyberspace as long as this message remains attached all other rights reserved to the author
let me open this one with confession love cop movies adore them with such an unwavering near foolish passion that was actually one of the first in line to see 1998 one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers steven was it any good well just about as good as baldwin steven seagal impression for those ve confused the answer is resounding no now let me clarify don love just any cop movie not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80 and now slowly gulp returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker partial to those gritty earthy cop dramas like serpico donnie brasco and the french connection problem is these films come along just about as often as george bush makes cogent point so whenever true cop movie does hit multiplexes come running towards it like an eager puppy and inevitably leave head bowed tripping over my squiggly tail so what is it about cop movies that transform me into moron willing to shell out $7 50 for movie called one tough cop which actually sounds lot like wiseguy spin off no truth is sucker for those barren streets that gritty graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops like modern day knights must shield us from their iniquitous clutches yes it all very corny and awfully boys clubish which guessing is precisely where these feelings come from as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies etc the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies and heighten them turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos as an adult my tastes haven changed all that drastically sure can get cerebral high from the emotional complexities of krzysztof kieslowski film but still delight at the promise guy film could potentially bring now what if it the cops who re the corrupt ones ooh that one really gets me going these protectors using all that at their service taking advantage of others for their own gain throw courtroom drama yech into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city how absorbing is prince of the city you ask so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama sub genre loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar remained completely and utterly involved the film stars treat williams who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at since was hatched mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city cannot provide an answer as to why it didn though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat would guess that it probably has something to do with quite few bad career moves like mickey rourke and eric roberts both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory williams is talented leading man who didn make it to where he should have if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell here the actor is given role not all that dissimilar from al pacino in serpico also directed by lumet williams plays danny ciello member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre juliani streets of new york they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done the squad relies entirely on informants low level junkies to gain access to the big wigs and in order to obtain the info they seek they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice danny has done this and though he fairly honorable guy who took the job in order to do good his intentions have gotten bit skewed along the way he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as double agent he does so with one condition he will not rat on his partners right away we know that that is exactly what he ll have to do and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be undercover cop films are almost innately exciting even the kind that pull out all the cliches like in too deep how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal ambiguity and the danger in putting oneself in such risky position prince of the city takes all this and charges it with perceptive hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet as well as handful of intense performances most notably by treat lumet greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back and lets the camera soak up the action his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension and he rarely holds for reaction shots instead he clicks away at precisely the moment character stops yakking lumet worst tendency is one that many film makers especially oliver stone tend to overuse he relies little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension this isn as much problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan lumet most recent cop lawyer endeavor movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices maybe he and treat should get together for drink or something the most recent completely unnecessary remake of gloria here he was on sustaining tension in film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot some of the formula pictures like the best are the most simplistic hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable of course cop movies aren popular anymore yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines but just look at the average hollywood action movies flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn gay the lame comic relief character who never funny and on and on for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is back to the basics cop courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills it focuses completely on its story and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies there great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing this is scene that would never make it into michael bay film even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon not one damn tear it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human excuse me weak in the very next scene danny speaks in hushed raspiness straining to get the words out he lost his voice does that little itty bitty detail matter maybe not to most but it sure made my night and in sprawling epic of corruption greed betrayal and violence it nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things
hedwig john cameron mitchell was born boy named hansel in east berlin as teen seeking his other half he reluctantly agrees to sex change operation in order to marry american luther maurice dean wint the operation performed by hack surgeon is botched and the angry inch is all that left now she hedwig comes to america is abandoned by luther forms rock band and falls for her 17 year old lover prot tommy only to be rejected by him later too she and her band the angry inch shadows the now famous tommy gnosis across the us for revenge but hedwig is really in search of her lost other half in hedwig and the angry inch first time helmer john cameron mitchell along with composer lyricist stephen trask created and starred in their acclaimed off broadway production that has become the movie and quite movie it is in its eclectic variety of songs outrageous costumes sets and makeup and especially riveting performance by mitchell as the title character mitchell and trask have reinvented the movie musical and couple it with the underlying story of just whom hedwig is and what she is looking for am by far not big fan of musicals sure there are exceptions like bob fosse all that jazz and cabaret but for the most part they are just not my cup of tea hedwig and the angry inch is an exception though with its combination of humor wit and collection of tunes that covers musical styles ranging from the rocky horror picture show and meatloaf to david bowie to the sex pistols the original songs by stephen trask also appearing as one of the members of the band the angry inch are full of energy and variety and even though it not my kind of music found every one entertaining and fun the audience saw hedwig with thought so too the main attraction to this one man woman show is the presence of its star john cameron mitchell gives solid sometimes fun sometimes angry performance as person searching for self enlightenment and love as young boy growing up in east berlin hansel is abused by his father and raised by his german mother in tiny flat so small that mother would make me play in the oven where he listened to pop music on armed forces radio later as young man he meets luther another and is swept off of his feet the ensuing angry inch incident comes soon after flash forward to trailer park in junction city kansas and luther is leaving hedwig for another boy frustrated and broke she takes on baby sitting and the odd job to make ends meet she also forms band with four korean housewives and the musical talent of hedwig is born she meets falls for and loses young tommy who steals her songs and goes off to become rock sensation jealous and angry hedwig and her new band begins campaign to shadow tommy tours and with the help of her manager phyllis stein andrea martin is trying get law suit going against the star for stealing her songs hedwig and the angry inch get gigs not coincidentally at chain of seafood restaurants that just happen to be next to the forums where tommy gnosis is playing things finally come to head so to speak in new york city the popularity of the off broadway musical and its offshoots have garnered ready made audience base for hedwig the wit humor music and search for identity has great appeal to young adults but the charismatic presence of mitchell makes this cut above what it could have been it is this one man woman show that casts its spotlight on its internationally ignored rock star and mitchell is outstanding in the role there isn lot going on with other characters though there are amusing little sidebars like hedwig backup singer lover yitzak miriam shor deciding to break away from the band to join polynesian road show of rent as puerto rican drag queen the low budget that the moviemakers have for the production belies the quality of the film attention to details hedwig costumes and outrageous cabaret like makeup the seedy trailer park setting and the kitschy seafood restaurants are loads of fun to watch and lend the appropriate air to the proceeds all on what has to be beer budget hedwig and the angry inch may not be for everybody but the energy of the effort the songs the imaginative sets and costumes and fast steady pace make it pleasure to watch if you re fan of contemporary edgy music it is an even bigger draw give it b+
it terribly unfortunate that stir of echoes tautly written and directed by david koepp who made one of 1996 unsung treasures the trigger effect should be released little more than month after the sixth sense which is still going strong at the box office these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night and although they have eerily similar storylines stir of echoes is more of straightforward psychological horror film while the sixth sense is closer to psychological drama additionally while the sixth sense had shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business stir of echoes is more conventional and predictable in its final twist and where the sixth sense was disturbing stir of echoes is just plain scary have feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits adapted from novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago stir of echoes opens with cute six year old boy named jake zachary david cope who is taking bath he is speaking directly at the screen but we immediately have feeling someone else is there finally he asks does it hurt to be dead apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people but unlike the sixth sense this young child isn the focus of the picture instead tom witzy kevin bacon chicago lineman is our protagonist jake is his son and maggie kathryn erbe whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant is his hard working wife one night while at party with their closest friends tom convinces maggie new age sister lisa illena douglas to try and hypnotize him it unexpectedly works and before long tom is seeing things he wouldn normally see including deceased teenage girl jenny morrison in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months seeking help from lisa she tells him that while he was under hypnosis she told him that after he awoke his mind will remain clear and free like an opened door she didn expect it to work but it did and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find way to help this girl he sees stir of echoes isn perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but in the thick atmospheric mood it conjures up it is terrifically eerie domestic horror drama and is not only effective on technical level but is impressive in its portrayal of struggling working class family kevin bacon and especially kathryn erbe 1997 dream with the fishes are top notch and exceedingly believable as loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house and instead of maggie not being understanding she instead believes what tom says and aside from being little worried by what he is going through does not try to stop his pursuit bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts and therefore are easier to relate to and always plausible as struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet in masterfully done entrancing sequence tom is hypnotized by lisa but instead of watching him we instead see what he sees starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater and so we as audience members are watching movie screen from inside theater which is also showing movie screen in theater telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as fuzzy word in siyah letters pops up on the screen we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is sleep never before have seen hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly construed as this one truthfully this set piece and another in which tom wakes up from nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt are worth the full price of admission alone just to see them on the big screen having loads of fun with her small role as maggie sister lisa illeana douglas 1995 to die for her last great character is delight but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films funny and enjoyably offbeat douglas gets to utter the best line in the film while talking to maggie about tom visions of the girl she remarks wouldn be worried about him seeing another girl although the fact that she dead gives one pause also of note are jenny morrison 1994 intersection who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character and liza weil remarkable in 1998 whatever as morrison grieving teenage sister debbie if the resolution of stir of echoes does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential and it doesn what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty the music score by james newton howard and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects successfully compliment and foreshadow the off kilter frame of mind that tom is put into and director david koepp proves once again that he is director with knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically written characters stir of echoes isn as good as the sixth sense but why should it need to be both films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet and stir of echoes really is spinetinglingly good horror film
review peter jackson the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in movie and still coming in at the extremely cheap $30 million price tag but for those who were dismayed by this year blockbusters like twister and independence day the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects and for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily the frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as high profile movie can get michael fox stars as frank bannister con artist who can speak to ghosts he uses this ability to set up scam in small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people then he comes and pretends to get rid of them this is how he has made living ever since his wife died in car crash years ago frank latest customers are young couple played by trini alvarado and peter dobson when dobson ends up dead alvarado starts to take an interest in fox but dobson spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he dead this leads to very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado with dobson tagging along as ghost things start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for series of murders taking place in the town fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims but noone else can see that so when fox shows up to try and save each victim naturally people suspect he is the killer fox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector hit list and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox attempts to save her from this evil spirit there are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh the movie starts off as siyah comedy and ends up horror action film the mix between these genres are perfect no laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror and vice versa one point of contention might be lackluster score by danny elfman but that hardly seems like flaw when you have such diverse cast all in top form michael fox delivers one of his best performances to date as man who hides the sorrow of his wife death and then is forced to confront this later on alvarado looking like andie macdowell makes great frightened tough and smart heroine and jeffery combs as paranoid fbi agent is brilliantly bizaare the frighteners never once feels like it is running long the first hour is as funny as any comedy this year and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters this movie is probably what casper would ve looked like if david lynch directed it it easily the best film of the year so far
in zoolander the world most successful influential and intellectually challenged male model derek zoolander wonders is there more to life than being really really really good looking obviously the film creator and star ben stiller asked similar question when crafting feature length movie out of his hilarious vh1 vogue fashion awards short film subject can there be more to this film than being really really really silly no of course not and it never aspires to be anything more much like derek zoolander is sweet simpleton of movie it not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy and it never produces any gut busting laughs except maybe scene when derek model roommates all die in tragic gasoline fight accident riotously funny take off of tommy hilfiger ads but it has satisfying handful of strong chuckles wild characters and performances and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused better yet this exaggerated version of the original three minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs fashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu will ferrell drafts plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed enter derek whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel owen wilson takes the spotlight on the trail of mugatu plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries stiller real life wife christine taylor and she hoping to use mugatu pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme much like the austin powers films zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today wilson is hysterical as the young vain hansel ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant freakish mugatu in the same way dr evil upstages everyone in austin powers jerry stiller ben dad who best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld makes priceless turn as derek slimy agent maury ballstein even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as deranged large assed masseuse as for ben stiller it seems his derek has one gag he stupid which plays out in some uproarious one liners unfortunately taylor seems out of place and out of her league here maybe it just because can stop seeing her as marcia brady who she played in both brady movies making her unbelievable as dowdy brainy plain jane who hasn had sex in two years she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo who would ve added real comic substance to the flimsy role while zoolander is hardly highbrow its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days zoolander no masterpiece but very worthy distraction
contact is film that tries to do several different things it is intended to present realistic picture of what alien contact might be like to restore sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such situation and to tell personal story of romance between the astronomer dr ellie arroway jodie foster and the religious spokesman palmer joss matthew mcconaughey the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable albeit less immediately engaging than say the cold blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv the files the aliens in contact seem to be like us they are more curious than anything else they know we exist they want us to know that they exist and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly and between the characters ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with force rarely seen since stanley kubrick 2001 space odyssey most of the film however takes place on earth where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens scientists are enthusiastic ultraconservative religious leaders are wary and government officials are caught somewhere in between the debate is fueled largely by dr arroway atheism she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind representative to another species the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions especially when it reaches conclusion that suggests that the two approaches science and faith could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed still the film falls little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society the two sides are represented primarily by arroway and by far right fundamentalists but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far right fundamentalists palmer joss occupies something of middle ground but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as less than ideal spokesman for any ideology then again the film does concentrate mostly on public debate which does after all tend to be dominated by extremists rather than on dinner table or college dormitory discussions contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues then but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself the film one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss for one thing it resorts to the tired movie clich that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction the romance rarely if ever sheds any light on the characters although it occasionally tries and fails joss explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement guess you could say man of the cloth but without the cloth for example is more like punchline to joke than character development instead the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments granted this is plot and idea driven film and the characters are secondary but this just seemed like laziness on the writers part more than anything else the successes of contact however far outweigh its failures even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether which it didn the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it memorable film contact doesn quite cover all the bases but it covers about as much as one could hope for in two hour film and its rejection of big budget theatrics for more realistic story is certainly admirable and would not be surprised if ten years from now contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction
armageddon in itself symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking stories have been replaced with special effects character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue plotting consists of bunch of shit getting blown up armageddon is as stupid as loud and as shallow as any movie you ll see come out this summer or maybe even any other summer but loved every freaking minute of it believe me just as shocked as you are hell don even know why went to see it in the first place the previews were so annoying that predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year or at least in the running sorry but somebody dial 911 isn quite the tagging that going to sell movie it isn too wise either to market the film using the movie stupidest lines beam me up scotty yeah that sure is great writing mean let face it armageddon previews rival the truman show as being some of the worst of the year neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice of course you all know the story when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas nasa calls in the us top oil drillers to go into space and implant nuclear device eight hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid in the coarse of all this mayhem we are introduced to some interesting and not so interesting characters belonging to the former group is rockhound steve buscemi horny little womanizing genius who always full of wisecracks even when flying into space at huge amount of also there the always cool as hell billy bob thornton as dan truman the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 only without the intensity and great lines to deliver then on the flip side of the coin is the tired contrived character of harry stamper bruce willis who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent can quite place the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie basically that about it as said this is hardly film about plot it another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden case in point nasa doesn know that there is even an asteroid on it way until eighteen days before impact huh another example at one point in the movie two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of poster of kennedy how pretentious is that want another one okay before the oil drillers blast off into space one of them starts singing leaving on jet plane and soon all the rest join in did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture but naturally all this sappiness melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin time at the movies and don get me wrong despite all of the things found wrong with armageddon still very much enjoyed it so even if you don win one of mcdonald free tickets it still definitely worth checking out
it is always refreshing to see superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for living to want to take chance and play less than savoury character as mel gibson does in payback of course if was being paid $25 million for one month work probably be willing to take risks as well but that neither here nor there payback is based on novel by richard stark apparently actually donald westlake author of the grifters itself fine crime film which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys lee marvin the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back by whom we don know yet all we know is that gibson as porter isn happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back and getting even in the process no matter what the consequences it turns out that the man he after is val gregg henry his sometime partner with whom he stole briefcase full of cash from gang of chinese mobsters obviously not having much of crisis of the soul val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off debt to his employers porter however is the sort of man who holds grudge and once on his feet goes about exacting revenge on the double crossing val gibson gives terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play that of slightly unhinged guy who doesn mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants you probably wouldn see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat out of character role such as porter jim carrey won be doing anything like this in hurry after what happened the last time he tried the cable guy anyone harrison ford idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent the last time schwarzenegger played villain was batman and robin which we won mention further and has stallone ever really played villain at all this is not to say that porter is villain per se while he isn the sort of character you wouldn want to get on the wrong side of he nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right hand men just to prove how mean they are porter is only trying to get back what is not so rightfully his which in way is almost understandable payback is an enjoyable dramatic siyah comedy thriller which won be remembered as being among gibson most important work but is still one of the finer films he done the only real problem with it is that while everything seems to work out in the end was left feeling something was lacking was that all the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute and the final voice over doesn ring true even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film noir style the rest of the film embodies the film just ends far too suddenly after huge build up in the penultimate scenes fine film even though it needs just little something more to be the kind of film that can be recommended without hesitation just be ready for possible letdown of an ending
star wars episode the phantom menace 1999 review by matt pusateri few movies evoke nostalgia enthusiasm and affection like george lucas 1977 classic star wars the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in generation of filmgoers but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture arguably more americans today can explain what the force or jedi is than budget deficit or serb so 22 years after the release of the original and 16 years since the third film the return of the jedi how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation can new storyline and new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy luke han solo and darth vader all cultural icons against this challenge the fourth star wars film episode one the phantom menace hit the screens last week and despite some early critical reviews in the major media the film is neither flop nor disappointment while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series it is nonetheless engaging exciting and visually breathtaking it is worthy sequel er prequel to the original star wars films the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films as the film opens obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars is only young jedi apprentice still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor qui gon jinn liam neeson the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle trade dispute that has developed into blockade of the planet naboo by shifty trade federation the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations but in the middle of planetary invasion rushing to protect naboo young queen amidala natalie portman later after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice on tatooine qui gon discovers young slave boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd who not only can help them get the parts they need but displays uncanny intelligence insight and instincts qui gon senses the child is unusually strong with the force and begins to suspect that he may be the one prophesized to bring balance to the force as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows far from being galactic savior the innocent looking year old will in time become the ruthless darth vader complicating matters further is mysterious hooded figure darth sidious is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo and sends out lethal apprentice darth maul to find and capture queen amidala while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul if the plot sounds bit complicated it is the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic the demise of the jedi knights anakin turn to evil and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy but the complexity is not overwhelming the story moves quickly with the only drawback being that many questions predictably remain unanswered at the end of the film setting the stage for the next episode one of the reasons the film story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing but too unfocused it unclear whose story phantom menace is in the original trilogy the movies were clearly luke story with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight but it unclear whether this new film is anakin story or obi wan if this trilogy is centered on anakin it shaky foundation lloyd like many child actors lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers and as result his character seems shallow and unimpressive on screen we see nothing that suggests dark side lurking underneath his little boy face or for that matter any presence that would make him seem so special that qui gon is willing to believe he is the one the rest of the cast does fine though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight mcgregor is well cast as obi wan and conveys balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility portman fits the role of young queen well but her lines were often very formal giving her little room to give her character much personality the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters but the interaction between them individually the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series but unlike the previous trilogy lucas doesn do as good of job playing the characters off one another in star wars there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han han and obi wan and leia and luke the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities in the sequence in where luke han and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star the audience learns lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other individually they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers but despite the need for richer dialogue and stronger character interaction the film is still very engaging many of the wonderful elements of lucas previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining first of course is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates the characters visit magical underwater cities evade dinosaur sized sea monsters fight battle droids and menacing destroyers on venetian looking planet of naboo watch spectacular event part roman chariot race part nascar circuit on the arid desert planet of tatooine then head to corsucant the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council each location is elaborate and complex lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings he creates rich spectacular landscapes palaces and skylines most of the new special effects in his re released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren possible when the films were made more than ever in this new film lucas universe is filled with menagerie of creatures robots with personalities and supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters the best such character is watto greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves watto has scratchy italian voice and short paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like hummingbird as he floats around the room of all the computer generated characters in the film watto is the best done and most enjoyable speaking of computer generated characters no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film jar jar binks with more than 80 minutes of screen time jar jar is the realization of george lucas dream to include fully computer generated character into the cast of the new trilogy jar jar clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon accidental sidekick jar jar usually performs comic relief role in the film lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors however despite the technological magic that makes his character possible jar jar isn completely convincing he still moves and sounds too much like cartoon to blend into scene throughout the movie jar jar never transcends roger rabbit like presence you accept that he there but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character initially found jar jar annoying but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film on my second viewing of the film jar jar was lot of fun and didn mind him at all second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates despite all the film struggles between good and evil and the sober musings about one destiny and the force like all star wars films the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously fortunately lucas hasn lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment not high art from the bumbling jar jar to one man two headed announcer team calling the action at the film thrilling pod race sequence to cameo appearance by in the film the phantom menace is simply lot of fun with lots of half hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed and finally the phantom menace works because as in all his films there is no shortage of speed and action from beginning to end there are light saber battles hair raising chases and thrilling duels between good and evil the pod race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film and the final showdown between obi wan qui gon and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed the phantom menace won win any major oscars it probably won beat titanic box office record and it not even the best star wars film put it third after the original and the empire strikes back but it an exciting and entertaining film far better than your typical summer blockbuster the film can live up to it hype no film not even the original star wars could have done that but it still worth seeing probably more than once
any movie about the underground music scene is difficult beast to master any meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the dumbing down of the experience to make it more accessible to the general public or the film is produced and directed by people that have about enough understanding of the subject matter that they ought to work as production assistants for vh1 human traffic new film exploring the british underground party rave scene and the people immersed in the world of clubbing pubbing drugs sex and the beautiful beautiful music is an example of how it really ought to be done the film follows five brits in their young twenties during wild weekend of parties drugs dancing sex pop culture discussions relationships and wanking off in front of mirror while mum interrupts the cast of character consists of jip john simm our narrator who has bit of problem with his willy known as mr floppy koop shaun parkes our siyah dj maestro who has insecurity issues afraid his girlfriend nina nicola reynolds is shagging other men nina herself can stand her mcjob and longs for the freedom of the weekends lulu lorraine pilkington jip best mate is tired of her cheating boyfriends and moff danny dyer can seem to escape the siyah hole of his awful life the film follows these five individuals during one weekend as each of them discovers love friendship and self fulfillment all against the raging party background human traffic is proof that cinema can still tell us deep stories while being visually alive as director justin kerrigan subtle use of the camera lets the audience become part of the action the use of direct communication to the audience by the collection of characters works well making the viewer the subconscious mind for the characters dialogue is crisp and moves with an even pace and the acting is confident however the two females leads tend to promote their relationships and dialogue with bit of unneeded urgency that shows through when poignancy is needed human traffic does not try to explain the rave scene instead it gives the audience the ability to listen to the people inside it letting you choose your own convictions about this powerful musical movement that brings together strangers friends and lovers for one blissful night of music and peace
uncompromising french director robert bresson lancelot of the lake achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory morte darthur instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table it dethrones them by revealing arthur as weak ineffectual leader and the knights as group of jealous bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them chivalry has no place in lancelot of the lake except as that of dying ideal bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning decimated after failing merlin command to retrieve the holy grail the mystical cup that was filled with christ blood bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest bloodshed and failure the opening sequence is series of clumsy disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights head is hacked off stomach is impaled skull is split open skeletal remains hang from trees and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of flaming house since the film starts with camelot in near ruin and takes only an hour and half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion it doesn carry the grand tragic resonance of other arthurian films we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power therefore there is no real downfall to witness but then again it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film rather it is lancelot and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart than the external downfall of kingdom lancelot has always been tragic figure in the arthurian tales and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh the greatest of all knights he was flawed only in his love for arthur wife queen guinevere and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere laura duke condominas he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom but he is powerless in his passion when sir mordred patrick bernhard accuses lancelot of the affair other knights including sir gawain humbert balsan spring to lancelot defense it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table the flesh wins out over the spirit and the consequences are dire bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men hearts and minds lancelot of the lake is filled with his particular trademarks stripped down minimalist style flat expressionless dialogue and grand use of natural sounds in place of music he uses background music only twice in the film during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits the music here is heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film thematic elements the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor the neighing of horses the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest like most of his other films bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless flat voices all the actors he used in lancelot of the lake had never acted before and with the exception of patrick bernhard they never acted again never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on given word instead of using vocal inflection bresson strove to create emotion through images in some ways this technique works in other ways it doesn the final montage of arthur men battling each other is quite marvelous and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to literal scrap pile sums up the entire film in one moment however other times bresson uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable for instance during an important jousting contest bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses legs he does this repeatedly opening each shot with the same few notes from bagpipe and the raising of different flag while there might be symbolic value in this the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome nevertheless lancelot of the lake is fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by master filmmaker bresson style may not be for everyone but one has to respect his strength as an artist by re evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own he turns lancelot of the lake into something rare in modern cinema truly personal film
for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend there are certain rules that he needs to follow firstly fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship secondly buy her beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes thirdly find the perfect moment and location to propose finally the groom wannabe should probably get her parent blessing of these four the last one can be nightmare meeting parents is rite of passage fraught with unexpected questions bouts of nervousness the reality of being disliked and the inability to make positive impression if you re lucky things will go smoothly but if you re greg focker ben stiller everything will go wrong and with name like that how could it not when greg first meets his fianc father jack byrnes the grimacing robert deniro greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive when he tells jack that he male nurse the incorrigible dad shoots back not many men in your profession huh greg it definitely not good start but greg is determined to win him over and it this desire that fuels the movie he first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner it doesn matter that he jewish if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace then that what he going to gamely do oh god you re such good god he moons his discomfort at trying to force out simple prayer will make you chuckle but when jack gives him the deniro squint that familiar unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility it pretty hard not to grin things get progressively worse for greg and that too bad because he genuinely likable guy with romantic heart eventually he begins to try so hard that he starts to mess everything up committing host of gaffes that embarrass humiliate or injure other people it never ending ordeal of missteps miscues and mistakes he buys some champagne but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances he tries to find jack missing cat but his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble and there are several other episodes each one trumping the next in outrageousness the more our well meaning beau screwed up the more the audience groaned in sympathy we liked greg and we liked this movie meet the parents is farcical comedy that certainly has its moments just sit back and watch greg get into trouble no matter what the situation whether its playing harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking smoke on the roof of the house things will horribly go wrong we laugh at greg expense but love often makes person do dumb things and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool deniro is also affable tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside their tug of war is often funny the slapstick is elaborate and there are several topical throwaway gags mostly targeted at the airline industry to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future in laws from hell
