the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do lives are often at stake and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable prone to turn on the negotiator at moment notice the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor psychologist and sham artist in addition to being police officer he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence or failing that must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower most of all the negotiator must be able to enter situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible and quickly gain control of the situation dominate the conversation and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants it takes pretty smart person to do that but what if the hostage holding criminal is just as smart what if he also able to think on his feet in fact what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor it is this circumstance which forms the basis for gary gray the negotiator in this film police negotiator danny roman samuel jackson is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman home roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder faced with the scorn of most of the police department and under close scrutiny by the media roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain office don quite remember if the captain actually said hate to do this but although it wouldn surprise me if he did luckily the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above after being offered take it or leave it deal by the district attorney roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum walsh taking him and others hostage and proclaiming he has been framed although roman actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build up gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian kevin spacey which soon ensue jackson while superb actor is miscast in the role of roman the actor has become so popular and so often identified as protagonist notable exceptions can be found such as in jackie brown that we as an audience have difficult time believing he will carry out his threats the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence how can we believe he going to shoot hostage no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier unfortunately this preconception saps the film of some of it would be suspenseful moments and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson acting ability almost every time he in scene jackson steals it without looking back when spacey appears the film has already run about third of its course his is an interesting character made out to be some kind of negotiating superman our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation can talk man out of blowing up the sears tower but can talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone he says when he gets the call to action however he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be soon his character has to negotiate not only with roman but also with the swat commander david morse who is itching to send in team to take roman out all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation should negotiations fail this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor as the second protagonist spacey measures up nicely gray really lucked out with this cast david morse as commander beck ron rifkin as commander frost and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices morse played similar role in the rock rifkin played the in confidential and spencer played police detective in cop land with the level of acting however this can be forgiven also in the supporting cast paul giamatti as rudy one of the hostages is notable for the comic relief he provides his character is initially so slimy and giamatti himself just looks so shifty that you expect to laugh before he even says anything fortunately this doesn distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout walsh as the suspicious internal affairs inspector clocks in with one of his final performances sadly the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam backdraft and nixon for one of his best performances check out sling blade in which he plays mental patient sharing ward with billy bob thornton when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success the actors performed together in few good men the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing in the end the negotiator has plotline that parallels it reality we re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best as an audience we re also given situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into movie and we like to see if one will dominate the film both provide some pretty good entertainment

the blair witch project was perhaps one of kind unique film that played completely on its own merit managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses its success made sequel inevitable but this is not the sequel suspect anyone much wanted after the release of the blair witch project tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville in order to get glimpse of the blair witch locals have turned this mass hysteria into great business opportunity selling twig sculptures stones and dirt like those in the movie and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with bullhorn shouting get out of these woods and go home there is no goddamned blair witch jeff is one of those people who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage after he got released from the mental institution he created mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods on the blair witch hunt among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend the pregnant tristen who are writing book on the hysteria caused by the film called the blair witch history or hysteria and kim who dresses in siyah and has some psychic powers the last member of the crew is erica young beautiful witch wannabe who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore saying the first rule of wicca is do no harm because whatever you do will come back to you threefold this strange group plunges into the woods where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr abandoned house strange things start happening when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain after while they discover strange markings on their bodies they are somehow lost in time as it loops uncontrollably back and forth they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods documentary director joe berlinger paradice lost helms blair witch leaving the creators of the first film dan myrick and ed sanches in the background the opening scenes the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film is more promising approach because instead of trying to cover similar ground it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story that is never resolved and ends with very anticlimaxic epilogue in way this is typical hollywood sequel more money has been spent and more people have worked on project that was doomed to fail the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated of course in these situations quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody red forest with carter burwell being john malkovich and fargo musical score in the background you realize that with the exception of its title this film has absolutely nothing to do with the blair witch project blair witch was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection creating completely different atmosphere with its graceful cinematography production design and flashy editing the film has very polished look which is impossible to associate with the first installment and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body couple of times he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor the key is simplicity blair witch project had story which was incredibly simple that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination the film was practically an empty screen on which we projected our most frightening nightmares the effect was incredibly powerful lasting and entir everyone but in different way book of shadows feels incredibly controlled and restrict here very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and clever that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with this is simply less artistic film that doesn have the talent and originality of its predecessor it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn always succeed but most importantly it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie which doesn allow it to destroy the original in the end can call it bad effort it less artistic not so scary and less original but certainly not bad it simply different in fact if you haven seen the blair witch project you might like this film for what it is cross between the blair witch project and the scream films the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned and incredible sense of surrealism but it common knowledge and experience that with few exceptions every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making to me the story of the blair witch project seemed completed but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that the book of shadows is certainly assured and it already time to look forward to blair witch
seen may 31 1999 on home video rented one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise with some films it might be just secondary issue but with `dark city what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are which is poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in movie there an old role playing computer game called `d ja wherein the player takes on the role of man who can remember who he is where he is and how he got there the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome conflict the premise to this film is not unlike that game only this time we don have control over the protagonist we begin by meeting seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city actually it more than just the city it the whole reality that isn just that neo gothic look la `batman `blade runner but is so fully developed it almost different genre completely later he will learn that his name is john murdoch sewell but for now he has no idea what going on other than the fact something is not right the fact there dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and mysterious hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling this opening scene alone goes long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre horrific tone the man doesn know who he is nor where he going and it interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him in fact this is the way all stories begin since it impossible to know the history of character their feelings values morals etc until after we ve observed them for while but in this case the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization developing the mood and outlining the story eventually some semblance of plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is serial killer wanted by the police we met inspector frank bumstead hurt quiet unemotional soft spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time two other important characters are also introduced dr daniel schreber sutherland neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john doctor and emma murdoch connelly jazz singer dolled up to look like caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film noir movies it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film he also contacts emma which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly complex mysterious back story but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot its lighting art direction and overall production design they don seem to be able to afford any gratuities however that might also be what keeping it from reaching its maximum potential by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place so much unlike the real world we know we come to realize that it all hoax everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction but as the film tagline says `last night one of us went off for reasons that are never clearly explained it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive process known as `tuning the aliens which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made they awake and either continue where they left off or begin new life they have no idea they did not have until then this premise certainly is interesting and director and co screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard he does provide some explanations such as that dr schreber is an assistant to `the strangers because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form the aliens mix and match the memories of the city population to see who will change and who will not in the process this creates for good deal of deep thought provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world however where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes person who he or she is the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant static and cold mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don help either for example john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her yet in some scenes crucial to the film plot we are expected to believe they do have genuine love for each other which is also part of the film climax and ending and that what proyas seems to be inferring with the film but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense ironically this is what made his first film `the crow work so well which had similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within nearly identical dark twisted world with `dark city the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message still the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable there lot to like here most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does the story as whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years `dark city is what the movies are all about the escape from the real world
stendhal syndrome condition where in the presence of art person becomes engulfed in painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression suicidal behaviour and personality disorder grim stuff to be sure but the subject of remarkable film from italy master of the horror thriller dario argento boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone the stendhal syndrome is quite magnificent return to form for argento it follows his disappointing american debut trauma 1992 the patchy opera 1987 and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980 based on the novel by graziella magherini the film stars argento daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of brutal rapist killer visiting florence to follow up several leads she is lured by the killer alfredo thomas kretschmann to an art gallery favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by painting and faints posing as bystander alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer strange game of cat and mouse begins gripping story evolves and coherent one too which may surprise those familiar with argento often lumpy narratives the stendhal syndrome is not simple cop hunting killer scenario it is disturbing and often compelling study of the central character psychological disintegration the script explores its psycho sexual themes with intelligence and candour perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers but as dark as its themes are the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years argento is once again working in his native italy and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent the film opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination flashback and real time with tremendous style proof that at his most inspired argento remains one of the world most exhilarating filmmakers the cast is generally good though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless asia argento performance is by turns risky awkward and fascinating it difficult role and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo and marco leonardi of cinema paradiso and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy does okay as anna work colleague and increasingly confused love interest but perhaps the stendhal syndrome single most striking element is ennio morricone soundtrack active since the 1960 morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts it mostly variation on the one theme slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards it been three decades since argento and morricone worked together this is long welcome reunion if the film has fault it is that the last half hour drags little and the film doesn quite reach completely satisfying climax but by the closing scenes the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento career note see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web
blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood premier leading men blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it it is very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well although at few points thought was watching music video as opposed to movie the ideas behind blade are good as is the basic plot of the story but at times things seem to get bit muddled and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once that really doesn take away from the story too much but it does hurt it little bit blade snipes is half man half vampire his mother was bitten by vampire when she was pregnant with him and as result he has many of the classic traits of vampire including thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by special serum which quenches his blood lust blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother but this isn as easy as it seems because the vampires in blade world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires where do vampires get money well in blade they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be very clever idea and great addition to the movie blade runs up against the evil deacon frost stephen dorff maverick in the vampire community he isn content to live among humans and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all powerful vampire rendering him virtually unstoppable it up to blade to see that this doesn transpire admittedly blade is style over substance through and through the story is relatively forgettable one but it is fun none the less the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from movie of this type this isn film that is going to win accolades for its performances and the actors know this the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise it popcorn movie and no one involved has any illusions otherwise blade production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done although the mtv style cuts did get on my nerves after while during long sequences blade is fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with fresh outlook on life very cool
no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan harrowing humorous horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe novel about young lad francie brady eamonn owens descent into madness in 1960s ireland on one hand it was difficult for me to become invested in francie story because he is such an unsavory character unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs nugent fiona shaw on another hand found it difficult to laugh at some of francie darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such sick needy child having been raised by drunken father stephen rea and suicidal mother aisling sullivan on yet another hand also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his for lack of better word bad deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them however the butcher boy power is undeniable and the film as whole is unforgettable perhaps because it is so disturbing what makes it so unsettling is the francie overall wink wink yet matter of fact attitude about everything expressed in cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie rea again think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs and you ll sort of understand anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens love francie or hate him you cannot take your eyes off of owens the butcher boy truly is twisted unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable in the lobby after the screening overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust that movie was so unfunny didn know what to expect it like something you chase for so long but then you don know how to react when you get it still don know how to react michael jordan on winning his first nba championship in 1991 or my thoughts after meeting him on november 21 1997
wild things is suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon denise richards and neve campbell that deals with all the issues sex love murder and betrayal the setting of the film is town named mavi bay it consists of many swamps and slums and on the other hand rich estates owned by the town different benefactors the film opens just before the beginning of senior seminar at the town ritzy expensive high school it is here that we meet all of the core characters there guidance counselor sam lombardo police officers ray duquette and gloria perez dark mysterious senior suzie toller and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor but none more than kelly throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape shortly after suzie too confesses that sam raped her as well this pushes kelly sex craving mother sandra to stop at nothing until sam is convicted during the trial kelly gives teary confession of how sam raped her however it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls it was all vengeful plan against the guidance counselor after sam is cleared kelly mother pays sam very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her it is then revealed that sam kelly and suzie were all in on it together it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda matt dillon stars as sam lombardo sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage he isn the obvious best of actors but dillon does give convincing performance however his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles although he never had many to start out with in the first place neve campbell who most people relate to scream and scream plays mavi bay outcast suzie toller suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film campbell is very successful with this character adding the slightest bit of charm to seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch playing kelly van ryan is denise richards kelly is your typical rich sexy head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses like her sexpot mother sandra one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother denise richards still hot off the press from starship troopers gives the most interesting performance in the entire film in the beginning kelly looks to be paper thin character but richards adds little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy but dominating as well kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette this character looks to be one of the most boring predictable in the film however it is relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story still the film doesn seem to gain much from bacon performance only his name in the supporting cast theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan daphne rubin vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez and bill murray shines as sam lawyer ken bowden hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller the eroticism which is portrayed with good taste is kept to minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters this is truly very good film worth seeing if your looking for movie with thick plot filled with it share of twists
robert benton has assembled stellar mature cast for his latest feature twilight film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames gene hackman and susan sarandon pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight when jack sends him on routine delivery job however the old instincts kick in soon harry is wading through mystery where friendships and lives are on the line and he no longer knows who to trust there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight in addition to newman hackman and sarandon james garner plays raymond hope former cop and one of harry best friends stockard channing plays verna harry former partner and possibly former love interest reese witherspoon is mel the distrustful daughter of the ames and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend giancarlo esposito appears as harry bumbling detective protigi and john spencer is suspicious police captain with cast like that it almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze luckily there more to the film than some sort of actor recognition ceremony twilight has solid film noir ish plot it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics but it has much more than lot of what passes for film these days the major cast members all deliver strong performances as can be expected of their caliber however none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable the supporting cast is enjoyable if little underdrawn stockard channing character in particular is cipher there more to her character than the film takes the time to describe it minor but irritating flaw with solid cast and good plot there lot to recommend about twilight it biggest flaw is actually its short running time at slim 94 minutes there lot of stuff that packed into an awfully small package still the chance to see newman sarandon and hackman working together is worth cramp or two
crazy beautiful suffers from the damned if you do damned if you don syndrome after spate of flighty cookie cutter teen films the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story but rather than applaud the production early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown afterschool special even worse in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people the studio got case of the heebie jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re shoot scenes and cut footage to tone things down needless to say the filmmaker was frustrated we were trying to make cautionary tale he told newsweek and we couldn show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from regardless the film works thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and script determined to transcend stereotypes crazy beautiful is quality fare good enough that half expected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes set in pacific palisades calif the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens every morning and evening carlos nunez jay hernandez takes two hour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school an honor student and star athlete carlos is responsible modest and focused as he works on securing place in the naval academy all is well until he meets nicole oakley kirsten dunst the daughter of rich congressman bruce davison nicole is drunk apparently hell bent on self destruction carlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her but he is only human and she has the greatest smile plus as her father notes she has real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral as with save the last dance crazy beautiful god how hate lower case titles takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh while noting the racial and social differences between the kids the screenplay dances around most of the clich there are still several mtv moments though the filmmakers make point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there cute as button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicole behavior she is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to get away from her before she drags him down hoped the boy would listen as carlos hernandez is revelation hunky without looking like the product of hollywood design team the young man can really act we will see lot of this guy in the future aside from its title the biggest problem with crazy beautiful is its ending which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy after carefully presenting credible characters and situations the conclusion feels rushed and lazy still this is the kind of film that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots afterschool special my ass crazy beautiful is the real deal
not since oliver stone natural born killers has there been movie this incendiary and not since david cronenberg has so called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility while fincher films have never suffered from lack of shock value his major character killings in both alien and seven are fine examples fight club marks the distillation of his pitch black comedic sensibility see 1997 the game into something like definitive statement jack norton acting as both narrator and protagonist is your typical cubicle clone whose disillusionment is amplified by seemingly incurable insomnia on the offhand advice of doctor he sits in on group therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer here he meets bob marvin lee aday aka meat loaf cancer emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia strangely the release he finds while sobbing on bob breasts allows him to sleep at night at least until fellow group therapy tourist named marla singer carter comes along to ruin things for him forcing grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity later he meets tyler durden pitt soap salesman with decidedly subversive outlook on life one night after his ikea furnished condo explodes don ask you ll just have to see the movie awright he is goaded by tyler into fight and damned if it doesn feel good it is pure raw existence brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison he moves into tyler squalid abandoned mansion and they form the titular organization an underground therapy group where men bond with bare knuckle savagery and very few rules the first two of which are don talk about fight club armed with charisma and an attractive anti corporate philosophy tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white collar slaves and dead end mcemployees resentment creeps into jack heart made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla funded by frivolous lawsuit tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem their initially juvenile pranks like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads quickly evolve into something more like sedition and jack fears that things have gone sour it is after this point when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original that the film uncorks disappointing plot twist it is so contrived and so conventional compared to what precedes it that everything which follows including the ending becomes far less interesting it major though not fatal flaw and for director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher it feels like cop out fight club is going to be misconstrued by great many people in the early going it has downright dangerous feel it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul and this is undoubtedly the message that few moronic punks are going to take from it ll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don spring up here and there and ll be even more amazed if fincher isn vilified for it by the same humorless witch hunters that are currently after oliver stone they needn bother because fight club is less message movie than fincher elaborate attempt at joke tyler durden for all his dionysian allure is really nothing more than the logical and far less hypocritical extrapolation of all those self help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me first gospel of self actualization in this context the joke works but like the latest columbine joke some people will get it and enjoy good laugh and others won hopefully though their silly moral outrage won spoil the joke for the rest of us

the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized methodical hatred five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days the first documentary from steven spielberg survivors of the shoah visual history foundation the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry as the introduction explains even as germany started to lose the war the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe in 1944 hungary had the last big population of jews within germany reach and they became the last target of hitler final solution each of the five tells his or her story their stories are intercut chronologically starting from normal life in pre war hungary they recall the nazi invasion of hungary being sent to work camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps they recall their horrible precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald the deaths of their family and friends their loss of hope each recalls his or her unfathomable eventual liberation and finally the last days shows their cathartic pained modern day return to their old homes and the camps needless to say their stories are horrifying amazing and emotionally draining by themselves the stories would be forceful testaments but by cutting them in parallel their impact is multiplied by five the last days is talking heads style documentary it mostly pictures of people telling their stories intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage in this kind of movie it almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on screen but director james moll made better effort than most at finding specific or at least relevant images to go with his subjects narration the liner notes one of the many nice features of this dvd indicate that there is some never before seen historical footage in the last days it not clear which scene it is it could be one of two that hadn seen before both powerful one is rare color footage shot by an american of piles of victims in cattle cars there is something jarring something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color when so much of the footage from world war ii is in siyah and beyaz another segment shows walking skeletons survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore there has been glut of holocaust movies and was skeptical that new documentary would have anything new to say but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war moll told specific part of the story in new way in greater detail and glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful mozilla status 0009f words for holocaust documentary but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring when skies are mavi and trees are green also the movie was shot on 35mm film and not video so the richness and detail are impeccable the dvd features are plentiful and well chosen there is theatrical trailer for the movie which is great introduction to the subject matter there are about fifty still photos both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors also the disc has two complete versions of the movie widescreen and full screen both on the same side one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors plus one for the crew you think outtakes would be inappropriate in holocaust documentary but they re not bloopers instead they are solid moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length one of them continues confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film renee firestone one of the five spoke on camera with dr hans nch german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz firestone was aggressive questioning the doctor about what his children thought the doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz he ends his prayer by saying forgive me for surviving it ambitious to shoot documentary on 35mm film it ambitious to make it on subject that has saturated cable television and movies it ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers but the last days handles all these potential obstacles very well it only fitting that the dvd with its wealth of interesting and relevant features would also be ambitious and successful
it has been 20 years since terrence malick film hit theaters his new film the thin kirmizi line is strange beautiful enigmatic mess of movie the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast it is filled with above the title stars the cast for the most part gives great performances john travolta whose role is nothing more than cameo seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve george clooney whose role became cameo in editing gives strange performance one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through character narration the rest of the cast especially nick nolte and elias koteas are unambiguously fantastic these actors and they are with two exceptions men were lured by the name of malick terrence malick is cinematic legend he has often been called the salinger of cinema his two previous films badlands and days of heaven are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures after he made them he disappeared for 20 years this film marks his return what he made with the thin kirmizi line is film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment the narration which fills the film and perplexes many not only lets us hear the narrators the characters themselves pontificate but also lets us hear such of the moment thoughts as scared the rather simple plot of the thin kirmizi line is used as canvas on which many stories are painted the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on hill plot synopsis for the thin kirmizi line is difficult because the story is fractured many stories are here from the clash between the lieutenant elias koteas and the savage colonel voracious nick nolte to the private ben chaplin who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going the fracturing of the story is ultimately fault it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into box shook the box and poured the results onto table this basically creates mess but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed not declaring that the film has no structure while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat the battles in the thin kirmizi line are astonishing and display mastery of filmmaking the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice this film uses color and light in such fantastic way that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video ultimately malick has crafted film that is movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them the film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature while some have said that the anti war message and pro nature tubthumping was juvenile it was done with so much complexity and thought that it cannot ever honestly be called childish after seeing the thin kirmizi line was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again
stuart little is one of the best family films to come out this year it cute funny and very good natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except few mild cusswords though read the book long time ago and really do not remember what it was about do know that this film does not disappoint finally movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be with few surprising twists some very funny moments and few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie stuart little is mouse he has finally gotten new home after being put up for adoption he now lives with the littles nice little no pun intended family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city they have little boy george played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki and now they have new son at first stuart takes while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat george doesn take too well to having mouse for brother at first but once the two play together they instantly bond stuart however is missing something and he wants to know who his real parents are the littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back hesitating the littles know what best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuart past ending up to sentimental and very heart warming ending one thing noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects just like in star wars episode the phantom menace stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real from the detail of their fur to the detail of the way the walk the special effects team put lot of time and effort on this $90 million dollar film and it shows another movie that this has in common with is babe with it talking animals and people understanding them it has family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids michael fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the homeward bound movies does fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could he to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable another gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball when he was timon in 1994 the lion king would have sworn he was comedian and now in stuart little he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike for the human actors geena davis who never gives bad performance does not disappoint here as well she fits nicely in her character and there is good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr little both make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996 jerry maguire even though stuart little is completely cgi the human characters and stuart have nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other stuart little is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter we get entertainment laughs cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie its nice to see pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see even though it has $90 million dollar budget sure it will make over that or just below it respectively for all you parents out there trying to find good family movie have yet to see bicentennial man as write this but as far as know stuart little and toy story are by far the best family films this year winner
with more and more television shows having gay characters and even the infamous ellen sitcom being centered on the life of lesbian the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines the birdcage was critically acclaimed as was this years chasing amy then along came in out and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released it also noticeable that this alternative lifestyle becomes less and less taboo as the years go by and it seems that using comedy as medium is proving worthwhile effort while it very serious issue to many it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety but the way we re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh at it is more and more becoming something we laugh with and when movie like in out comes along it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy it doesn poke fun at the lifestyle it simply uses it to all it comedic capacity just as love sex marriage birth death and anything else has been the idea for in out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids afflicted gay man in philadelphia if you remember during his acceptance speech hanks gave highly emotional tribute to the gay community and even sighted former gay teacher of his as major inspiration in his life it serious and touchy subject but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for potentially hilarious comedy and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick it true that if this same film had been written by heterosexual it may have been more controversial but because it was written by an openly gay writer the prerogative was set kevin kline who only seems to become more and more acclaimed stars as howard brackett high school english teacher in the small picturesque town of greenleaf indiana after three year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery joan cusack wedding date has been set and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story greenleaf high graduate cameron drake matt dillon is up for best actor oscar the small town eagerly awaits both events and both seem quite astronomical but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other when cameron drake is announced the winner the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher mr brackett everyone is cheering back in greenleaf that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words and he gay the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in simultaneous jaw drop the thing is nobody including howard can understand how cameron came to that conclusion and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such conservative american haven such as greenleaf naturally the questions pour from howard fiancee parents debbie reynolds wilford brimley students and the high school principal tom halliwell bob newhart and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious howard is clean neat honest sincere romantic and perhaps the most incriminating fact he loves barbara streisand the frenzy isn helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and entertainment tonight wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning one particular reporter is peter malloy tom selleck of inside entertainment who unlike the collage of other reporters wants to spend whole week in the life of howard brackett including coverage of his wedding the intrusion is all but welcome by howard who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute it seems that no matter where he turns camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees the dominoes begin to tumble as howard closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay it all sounds very devastating and it would be if it weren presented with near perfection by one of this year most delightful ensemble casts kline seems only to improve with age and he is downright perfect here the great thing about this film is that every single character has moment to shine and they use it wonderfully every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever dillon has never been so likeable cusack has never seemed so perfect for role and brimley reynolds and newhart all provide huge laughs when they re up to bat rudnick script is heavily laced with wit and humor and you ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for solid ninety minutes while in out doesn carry enough to give it four stars it remains one of the best done films of the year all around the script is exuberant the actors are absolutely top notch and we re allowed just the perfect blend of heart tugging so as not to bog down the laughs it remains solid comedy throughout its entirety yet we re still allowed sappily touching ending despite it subject matter and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex this is movie that everyone could and should enjoy frank oz best known as voice talent for muppets directs this film quite delightfully using all the potential rudnick script has to offer which turns out to be quite bit check this one out you ll have gay old time
weir is well respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject matter into deceptively simple powerful films the mosquito coast utopia and fearless post traumatic stress disorder among them in the truman show weir essentially breathes life into the now tired concept of media manipulation by tackling the material from the inside out it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top form playing the title character truman burbank by now you must be aware of the premise unbeknownst to him truman carrey is the star of his own tv series 24 peep show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants `seahaven his hometown and the show itself are the brainchild of christof harris who presides over his creation in the base of fake moon directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras for 30 years truman suspects nothing `we accept the reality we re given poses christof but desire to break free of the sunny town and visit long lost love in `fiji mcelhone who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement overwhelms him thus christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly rated program in few broad strokes weir creates convincing second reality and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three quarters through this allows us to comprehend and accept truman world before we contextualize it for all his madness christof has shown the world place without violence and hardship and demonstrated that human being can function well within it truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be well so darn nice like sibling or perhaps more appropriately caged animal in an interactive zoo they want to see him succeed the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to tight screenplay and sympathetic carrey he really is an everyman here abandoning his facial contortions in favour of credible wide eyed bewilderment cinematically the truman show is impeccable stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images as well it employs wojciech kilar piece zycie za zycie masterfully and beautifully if the film has any flaws one may find them in laura linney characterization as meryl truman wife doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone and in subplot involving truman `father which feels curiously incomplete there are few stupendous sequences and the film pulls off wonderful trick we become truman audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film they wear buttons asking `how will it end couldn wait to know myself though didn exactly want it to end for this inspired movie is possibly the best and most complex summer picture in years

waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury joe says `after all we re human in the context of events to transpire joe line is prophetic foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film does being human necessarily imply humane behavior through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of mob fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility expressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland lang takes great care in creating sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria in the scene prefacing the lynching the mob achieves critical mass at the bar deputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant but when he is unable to augment the mob myth of joe he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip we see in shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar what is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse what once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless to the audience the deputy quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob delirium crescendos lang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera but rather its stillness the shot composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes mirror to our own apprehensions as the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers it does so around the viewer as well the stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst swarm of irrationality because the camera does not track the deputy movement we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability as the bar scene progresses the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury of the mob this shot is unique because it is point of view shot where the audience not character in the film is the subject while long or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob panning from the mob belly distorts the audience spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large we see close shots of people faces contorted by their rage with the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within short radius of the pan lang offers the viewer sense of what it feels like to be the subject of lynching in this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob lang camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail in some greater sense it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind lang observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior as joe faces his peril trapped in his burning cell his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side lang makes rainbow martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts using his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality lang depicts man volatility and `impulse towards inconceivable cruelty reprising joe line at the train station we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity
because the press screening of planet of the apes was one day past last issue deadline was afforded the opportunity to see the film second time listen to audience reactions and read heap of reviews before writing this piece the chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance that the story was thin that mark wahlberg character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked to those people would like to say what the hell did you expect this is tim burton movie boys and girls tim burton movies have great art direction and thin clunky stories for the blissfully nasty disjointed and underrated mars attacks jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie burton reportedly tossed vintage mars attacks trading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up burton re imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on planet where apes rule men looks great the apes courtesy of make up magician rick baker are dazzling and ape city is wonder to behold like astronaut leo davidson wahlberg the film hits the ground running whisking viewers through head spinning series of solid one liners and engaging vignettes and establishing sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later as for wahlberg consider what burton does with his character from his start as filmmaker burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits pee wee herman the joker ed wood the ack acking martians etc and lack of interest in standard issue heroes so leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders as for lack of color remember leo only launches into space to get his monkey back he doesn want to lead humanity and he isn looking for romance from pretty but dull human estella warren or dynamic ape helena bonham carter terrific as an equal rights activist as man who just wants out wahlberg is focused subtle and sly the surprise ending provides the requisite shock and some more dandy visuals particularly of the approaching authority figures but admittedly isn nearly as satisfying as the one in the original for the original ending to work we only had to make one simple connection for this one we have to write whole new screenplay the 1968 apes boasted handful of great scenes cool looking monkeys deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed re delivering classic line and killer ending but viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of wrecking ball the 2001 planet of the apes offers different set of great scenes much cooler looking monkeys fine acting from wahlberg bonham carter paul giamatti and tim roth and not so good ending it also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that nothing to complain about
kadosh means sacred in hebrew amos gitai fictional work after spending most of his career doing documentaries is grim story about failed hasidic marriage even though the marriage is loving one the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic intolerable one as both groups are vying for control of the secular government gitai devarim yom yom is labor party leftist who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government it would sound the death knell of israel the emphasis of the film is on how the ultra orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god law from only the male view that if they ever got control of the country their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are the story takes place in jerusalem jewish quarters called mea shearim where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life which is much different than the way most jews live in israel this is controversial film in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones that the film is bound to anger most viewers no matter their belief it is slow moving meticulous film that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go the force of what is seen though filmed in an objective manner never taking cheap shot at the hasidim is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such practice of strict observance the film is meant to be critical of such rigid people as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can at present live in harmony with their own people and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace the film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual where every prayer is made to the virtues of god he even thanks god that he didn make him woman his wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom she looks at him with glistening eyes not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life and from seeing movies and tv meir is talmudic scholar his father abu warda is rabbi at the yeshiva he has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him child since the hasidim look upon woman role in life being only to conceive children and cook and clean house for the man while the man role is to spend his time in prayer therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage she receives an anonymous letter that states woman without child is no better than dead meir response is that it is written like that in the talmud meir father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken man who dies without progeny rips page from the torah all the blame is placed on rivka who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren she will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself as her rigid mother koenig dunks her in the holy water and says ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel their religion doesn permit them to be examined extensively by doctor rivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile but she cannot tell him that because of their religion so when meir father chooses younger woman for his son she is exiled to live alone in cold apartment in the same jewish quarters rivka spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live more liberated life she has long time romantic relationship with fellow hasidic yaakov but because of the way they were both raised she is still virgin when yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon something his sect is not allowed to do he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still believer he now works as singer in nightclub malka mother is worried that her daughter won get married so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef someone whom she doesn love yossef is very stern follower of the order he is also political activist who drives around the city in sound truck with bull horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies the two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage it will make her happy but while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage the harshest scene in the film is on malka wedding night yossef prays to god for child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs and without the least bit of affection only nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies as he goes inside her and rams her hard thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without word or gesture of love the sisters have choices like everyone else in life does but the choices are obliterated by one beliefs circumstances and inward nature and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up for the sisters the choices are life or death ones gitai by closing in on the daily rituals tight living quarters and close knit community has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life the film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would and everything seems strange to her all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories as she has made her choice and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed
no humans were harmed tested or tasted in the making of this film all recipes are fictions twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul director writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves they were party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive this true story briefly mentioned in the shining has no turned into 143 minutes long motion picture in 1847 the united states was land of pioneers of gold starved americans making their way west it was period of manifest destiny the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could capt john boyd guy pearce has become both hero and victim during this period of relentless consumption in ways he could never have imagined boyd journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during horrific mexican american war battle earns him banishment to desolate military outpost waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california upon his arrival he is greeted by small motley group of soldiers including his commanding officer hart jeffrey jones previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life toffler jeremy davies the fort personal emissary to the lord knox stephen spinella the veterinarian that plays doctor who never met bottle of whiskey he didn like reich neal mcdonough the no nonsense soldier of the group and the seriously over medicated cleaves david arquette cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions into this cold bleak and bizarre world staggers stranger colqhoun robert carlyle half starved scot who had been traveling with group of settlers until they became snowbound seeking refuge in cave they soon ran out of food and were forced to consume one another colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors oeuvre himself our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors and colqhoun tags along to help out soon it becomes clear that colqhoun tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive it involves an old indian myth called weendigo which states that man who eats the flesh of another steals that person strength spirit and very essence his hunger becomes an insatiable craving the more he eats the more he wants and the stronger he becomes there can never be enough and death is the only escape it all fairly sickening and you have to have healthy stomach to see the whole movie through as professionally made as the movie is you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this teen age horror fans won care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually satire about the pioneer spirit but they ll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces but jokes aside this is film that is well worth watching it has wonderful and mature characters that few horror film can boast of and strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end the two main characters are also the most interesting boyd is simple honest man tiered of war killing and fear his sacred wish is to live normal quite life away from gunpowder and blood colqhoun is different he proves that man on the brink of death would do anything to stay alive including sacrificing his own soul he believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically it is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen the atmosphere in ravenous is macabre and bizarre scary and surreal completely isolated from the rest of the world stands fort spencer here time stands still and nothing changes the inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage they are all somehow losers of society that have been banished men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life men that are nothing and has nothing to loose the result is some sort of cabin fever cannibalism is more like sick game for them since they find no pleasure in living they find some excitement in killing and dying it like who going to die first the unchangeable icy landscape where birds do not sing and even wind doesn move the leaves on the trees resembles kubrick the shining it hard to not get mad here one of the scary aspects of the film is strange connection that the viewer establishes with the characters and starts to understand them although they have turned into half crazed killers music is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere strange musical score composed by michael nyman the piano and damon albarn that often seems out of place and in complete contrast to the image somehow reflects the characters twisted reactions on the world and their situation the director herself stated that it was ok to laugh during the picture and must admit that it is often very funny in strange way such as the wonderful quote it lonely being cannibal you don get that many friends or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin saying eat to live don live to eat but mostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change every actor does great job especially robert carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal and guy pearce as the moral and honest soldier nagged by his undeserved honor this strange couple resemble lestat and lois in neil jordan interview with the vampire actually there are many amusing parallels and connections to vampire movies since the topics are so alike ravenous starts wonderfully and continues to shock and scare until it gets to the finale where it looses focus and gets too primitive and rather boring however these little failures don diminish the impression this is bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change in different situations it is scary fable about the monster that lurks in everyone soul dark side which we re all trying to hide but it there always it is one of the most frightening and successful horror films since the shining said no food didn say there was nothing to eat colqhoun ravenous
titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it upsetting that it isn the film which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into lot of finicial trouble if it sunk pun intended is labour of love for cameron who wrote and directed the film we all know that big budget dosen mean great film see waterworld 1995 but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic but sadly titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece although it is one of cameron best films the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic they find safe and inside picture of woman the woman in the picture an old winslet tells the explorers that the picture is of her the explorers invite her over and she then tells her story of titanic in the flashback dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson who after winning poker game wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic leaving liverpool to go to america also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater winslet who is being forced into marriage with man she dosen love at all cal hockley zane so her family can remain rich she nearly commits suicide on the ship but jack comes to the rescue saves rose they fall in love and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them oh yeah and the ship sinks and that is the main problem with the film and which stops it from being work of genius the story and script both by cameron are both weak the story is full of cliched characters the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry the poor boy with heart the stuck up mother and poor dialogue the script consists of lots of in jokes of how the boat won sink and most of the dialogue is pretty basic it shame really as the audience does have to sit through hours of this film without good dialogue film could become very long very boring film like camerons own terminator 1992 but luckily there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear firstly there cameron direction there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end there is lot of mayhem and panic all done very well by cameron it scary sight watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below thanks to cameron direction then the audiences attention is held for the full hours 15 minutes to support the directing are the excellent cast working very well with their underwritten characters dicaprio is good although he only looks 16 17 years old his performance of over excitiable yet also well mannered boy is excellent and he also has some funny lines winslet is great also and her transistion from well mannered rich girl to rebelous young adult is pretty smooth zane is deliciously evil as cal saying every line with sneer and flicker of the eye lash the audience really does come to hate him he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he in like dead calm 1988 but he does it really really well also worthy of note is kathy bates edward scissorhands 1990 as loud mouthed american finally the icing on the great things cake are the special effects cameron is whiz with effects just watch aliens 1988 terminator and true lies 1994 and they are used very well throughout the sweeps of the ships are awesome although digital domain who did the effects cannot animate human movement too well the humans seem to move to smoothly there just something odd about them you can tell that they have been animated on computer of course the ship sinking scenes are awesome with bodies flying all over the place and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film titanic then is wonder of directing acting and cgi but not writing and story again like most of camerons films the editing is loose cameron edits himself and the film could of come in under three hours with few more cuts titanic then although not the godfather of movies it could of been is wonderful attempt at creating work of genius enjoyable scary and even sad titanic is film cinema was invented for filling the screen with incredible images and assaulting the ears with awesome sound superb film but sadly not perfect overall rating=

up with plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day in the coal box one night brash american rooster flies in over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides to abandon the farm egg selling plan for pie selling plan she orders huge pie making machine cackling chickens go in pies come out what sort of pies chicken pies of course co director nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscar winning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and close shave the latter two were the second and third installments of trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures part of what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was park uncanny ability to make an old story seem new the wrong trousers for example pulled out lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks and close shave owed great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories but in the hands of park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived now teaming with co director peter lord park has created similar creature in chicken run the plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for quick reference to the ball bouncing scene with some spielberg inspired action sequences providing the excitement thing is the film doesn feel like it been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done part of it is the original idea who in the world came up with the idea to make prisoners of war movie starring chickens park and lord milk the incongruity for all it worth the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious and to them it is but they re chickens so it funny to us another thing that helps chicken run and most of park films succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods to the very films they re cribbing there are references to the great escape obviously and stalag 17 the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom there even nod to the blues brothers if you can believe it and the filmmakers even get in little light hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson nationality and film history the braveheart reference is hoot if you catch it when you consider just how fine line resides between funny parody and redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in its execution consider this since july of last year ve seen dozens upon dozens of blair witch project parodies on television on the radio and online out of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome why because once you got past the thought that they re parodying that blair witch movie most of the parodies had nothing to offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose they were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing conversely chicken run doesn lean on its parodies the film references are never the sole focus of any scene if you ve never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun even if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character park lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need parody shoved in their faces before it understood and as result chicken run is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either enjoyment of this movie doesn require knowledge of film history but if you ve got it chicken run is that much richer the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it hard not to fall in love with every one of them ginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but with soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known as the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nails it she has warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under brash gung ho veneer the characters inevitable romance doesn feel contrived but sweet poor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly isn any help jane horrocks delivers lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs hen that runs away with most of the best one liners all while perpetually crocheting sweater and two supply trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing dancing sequence they even come up with an inspired riff on something that baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken vs egg dilemma one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome but as with most of chicken run it comes as delightful surprise the film manages to cross all barriers it should be accessible to both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens the animation is first rate remember that this was all done the old fashioned way with actual humans moving clay figurines around on tiny set bit by painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great precise and unwavering attention to detail as in such top notch family fare as bug life or toy story chicken run has something to offer in nearly every frame certainly passive viewer can enjoy it as straightforward story with worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but active attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they ll catch all the details anyway the movie just boatload of fun funnest damn movie ve seen all year
this film is based on the campy tv show from the 1960 under the same appellation mind you most people including yours truly who will see this movie will not have seen any episodes from the original series the movie is really stand alone in that regard the family robinson lost in space plot set in the year 2058 the family robinson is chosen to sail out into space in search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs in order to survive its future colonization process if you will they are joined by able pilot west leblanc and evil uninvited stowaway oldman who does not want to see the trip conclude on successful tip eventually their trek goes awry and all are lost in space how do get back to earth is the question that infests the rest of this sci fi epic critique this film reminded me lot of the fifth element 10 from the summer of 1997 it film with lot of flash but very little actual substance admittedly there isn an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film but this film does run little too long and did lose me in regards to its complex time travel multi dimensional story line having said that the special effects in this movie were amazing and the overall look and feel were also way above average you really felt like you were in the future and riding through space with these poor souls unfortunately for this chosen family their 10 year old son is the smartest one in the group and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family ever heard that one before yawn the acting is ok and was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friend matt leblanc who shows us all that he definitely more than just pretty face on the down side the family riff raff that cuts through most of the picture is lame and time consuming even though we gotta give them credit for trying to develop characters in sci fi pic the story line is hard to follow the evil character in the movie actually tells people that he evil and the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long on the slick side many of the special effects are really cool the sequence in which the family is paralyzed during the hyper drive is awesome and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool the credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling will also admit that somehow they got me to semi tear up near the conclusion of this picture very odd overall if you re big sci fi fan check this movie out for the special effects and challenging narrative and if you re not would still suggest seeing this movie but then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts little known facts this film will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic 10 out of the top spot at the box office after 15 straight weeks at number one garry oldman is british and was once married to uma thurman for about six months mimi rogers was tom cruise first wife
it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare the best movie of the year would be summer vehicle jim carrey vehicle at that and so it is _the truman show_ is the most perplexing crazed paranoid and rib tickling morality play ve seen since don know when don credit carrey it starts with andrew niccol gattaca who created the script ten years ago the story replete with sublte religious and philisophical undertones is about man who discovers that every day of his existence has been televised for mass audience ironically it was within these past ten years that reality based television have become predominant fixture into our culture who knew one upping niccol it was when unlikely candidate director peter weir took the helm that things fell into place weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone deftly mixing capra with kafka throwing george bailey in universe inhabited by rod serling it was weir first stroke of genius to create seahaven suburban paradise prison that would make spielberg cower in shame for example bystander extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of _dog fancy_ the nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to _not_ leave the island credit weir for his second stroke the casting of carrey carrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn on and act goofy whenever the camera is near not here his performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on and although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination just as well the academy rarely honors goofy comedians excepting robin williams he stretches enough to alter his hyper silly image considerably playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carrey life no pun intended better in smaller more pivotal role is ed harris as christof who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13 work the problem people character with dustin hoffman megaglomaniac producer in _wag the dog_ and then only slightly svengalian it is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and truman well being yes in his own misguided way he loves truman as father to son and has provided the best universe he could provide he thinks rounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone mrs dalloway as carrey true forbidden love sylvia very effective in another pivotal small role laura linney congo and noah emmerich copland have the unfortunate task of playing truman wife and best friend their sitcom ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development the exception is at the very beginning where they speak into the camera wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly good for truman and for society in general there are other little problems with the script are we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such gigantic dome during his formative years was there any reason as to why in one scene it rained solely on truman even though it never had to how is it they hire hundreds of extras and none of them could drive boat and yet truman fearful of water is helming sailboat effortlessly and couldn christof have turned off the wind to strand truman at sea these little contrivances however do not hold candle to the overall effect of the work the audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show and we are drawn to truman mundane existence for no other reason than it is there the final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of mainstream picture with gnawing discomfort that hits you square in the gut upon leaving the theater was looking up in the sky wondering if it was nothing more than gigantic dome just checking

the first thing you notice about this movie is that it cold placed in minnesota and north dakota during the winter many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snow covered ground against background of beyaz just what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night as with most coen brothers films this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes each of which works out in the oddest way possible car salesman hires couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father along the way everything that can possibly go wrong does in brief scenes of vicious violence people get shot through the head in the back face chest and various other areas of the anatomy there is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen remarkably enough most of the movie is played for laughs even more remarkably it works the only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff frances mcdormand who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity with every good film the audience gains new knowledge here you learn _two_ things everyone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy and don do violent illegal business with low life amoral degenerate scum sucking losers oh yeah if you get shot in the face using brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy

computer generated imagery cgi the character of stuart while obviously computer generated image grows on you as the film progresses and you ll soon see him as much more than mere special effect there is also great deal of animal training involved with this film as many of the supporting cast are actual cats with computer animated mouths so they can speak it fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with stuart little is charming family film there are some great laughs in the movie with script co written by the sixth sense night shyamalan no less some moments that can only be described as too cute the boat race sequence is what won me over and even the majority of the one liners common nowadays in children films or films featuring nathan lane are tolerable kids and parents will love this one stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video there are two different dvds on sale one contains the film in full frame and the

screenwriters came in and polished up the script namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski who wrote the people vs larry flynt and ed wood and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel who wrote splash and multiplicity among others anderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film movie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track serious animation buffs will love the second one now know this is slightly off topic but it is related specifically to this dvd so must voice this now one of the music videos on the disc is for song called need to know by group called angels this video features four mid teenage girls the singers obviously having slumber party the girls ask ouija board need to know who to do who to do who to do as the song begins they then sneak out of their house and along the way they strike pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits then they head to party and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like ll be your pleasure all the time just say the words that you ll be mine um what the hell what does this have to do with stuart

appreciate them this is the way to do dvd good movie loaded with great features at reasonable cost the di$ney people could learn lot from columbia tristar
seen at the 21st portland international film festival film title supermarket woman director juzo itami country japan 1997 cinematography yonezo maeda music toshiyuki honda cast nobuko miyamoto masahitko tsugawa shiro ito yuji miyake akiko matsumoto super features typical itami film funny and pointed in its own way if you don care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket then this film is not for you maybe it is better to ignore it as this strong and biting satire as only juzo itami can deliver will give you an insight as to what some foods go through having in the past made films that pulled every punch imaginable from the family traditions the funeral to taxes taxing woman taxing woman returns to the diabolical gangsters minbo to hospitals the seriously ill juzo itami this time takes on the supermarkets own war to get the consumers and while this film has its funny side in the crazy situations that it creates it also shows another side which is very much the attitude of corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer goro has supermarket and competitor comes into the neighborhood trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket bargains galore its name has in mind the closure of goro humbler venue so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can goro hires hanako housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management than they are in anything else hanako as she gets familiar with the operation discovers many of the tricks of the trade done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market and the procedures are not always fresh food but new packaging and new date to try and convince the customers that quality is on the shelves hanako ideas take hold starting with few of the women that work in the supermarket being that they do not even shop there at all and hanako discovers along the way that few giveaways here and there make bit of difference if not cause some serious problems in the running of the store price error forces them to give away eggs for very low prices and causes the store few hassles but it brought the people in and everyone knows that these customers will buy few other things as the operation gets stronger the competition also has trickery up its sleeve and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks to one of the store managers as well as the meat and fish elder supervisors eventually these people are found out and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully until in the end they all have showdown and here the truth and honesty win out and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work for the corrupt opponent in the process they also find that freshness with some very funny jokes on this word as well becomes much more important tool than they imagined with some very nice performances in this hectic and fast paced film this film gives us sitting of two hours that is satisfying in many ways although failed love story between goro and hanako does not come off much even though towards the end it is suggested but this would take away from the satire and its strengths with food gags all over the place the film lets you have it and what fun it is worth seeing editorial the director of this film juzo itami died shortly after the film was finished and he left behind legacy of comedy and satire that is rare and uncompromising we would wish that he had been able to make one about film making of which he must have had few stories to tell but we will have to do with much of the japanese society and its many errant ways not to say that these things do not happen anywhere else america is no less guilty of any of these subjects at all should anyone have the guts to tackle it we could learn something along the way too worth seeing specially is taxing woman and its follow up taxing woman returns the funeral is also good although not as funny as the later films tampopo is also very enjoyable all four of these films are available in video which means your best local site for foreign film may have them ask for it
based on the relatively unknown in comparison to spider man marvel comic book blade tells the story of half vampire half human played by wesley snipes who was born of vampire latest meal now swearing vengeance against all vampires blade hunts them all his latest challenge is his biggest though he must stop the vampire deacon frost played by stephen dorff from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires admitedly comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums often viewed as juvenile by most standards even seen as illiterate by some judging by series of poorly recieved financial and critical comic book based films such as batman and robin steel barb wire the crow city of angels and the list goes on one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film to some degree agree with this sentiment having read comic books since the age of nine 21 right now can count the number of good comic book based movies not including japanese manga one hand the crow 1994 batman 1989 superman the mask and now #5 blade men in siyah is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book why is this for the most part it is because the filmmakers understand the comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match the crow and batman comics call for dark gothic atmosphere which the director provided the mask features wacky superhero with off the wall antics which the casting and cg effects reflect superman is not over the top with colour and flash and the film reflects this blade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film creating an appropriate atmosphere this is in stark contrast to joel schumacher contrived vision in batman and robin reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960 television show batman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact comics have grown up and so has the audience working on scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when ready which brings me back to blade although he may be familiar character to some due to his appearances in the spider man animated show on fox one will find no single trace of the warm and fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon the film depicts vicious vampire killer that uses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends the end results are not pretty by any means the story elements work very well for comic book story screenwriter david goyer who also wrote the crow incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films this is presented through karen hematologist portrayed by bushe wright this leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires add this to the neat little gadgets that blade uses including titanium sword complete with an anti theft device and one has an interesting premise however the film works best as an action film actor wesley snipes has an extensive background in martial arts most of which comes from capoeira brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks choreographing every single move proving that quick flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences see batman and robin for good example of that wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes regardless this film is far from perfect the film suffers from at least one major plot hole regarding the summoning of the blood god the ritual requires that number of pure blood vampires are standing on marked squares yet one of them is viciously murdered allowing the ritual to pass and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square obvious continuity errors also surface especially during scene where deacon frost takes drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame there is no trace of smoke either much of the special effects are not that spectacular either while vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch other cgi computer generated imagery effects are almost slapped together which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released the film release date was pushed back multiple times scenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake knocking the believability factor down few notches but then really hard to impress the film rating comes from gory violence but the lack of realism made me wonder why it got such rating for realistic violence watch saving private ryan the overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi still scenes involving non cgi special effects do surface and look much more impressive such as one particularly gruesome scene where vampire tries to use blade sword without deactivating the anti theft device wesley snipes is the saving grace

david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head it is one of many science fiction films released during the last year of this millenium that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future the story unfolds in near future where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs the world of the future is an unfriendly place where the scared inhabitants are hiding in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world allegra geller jennifer jason leigh the leading game designer in the world is testing her new virtual reality game existenz with focus group as they begin she is attacked by fanatic assassin employing bizarre organic gun she flees with young marketing trainee ted pikul jude law who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard unfortunately her pod an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program is damaged to inspect it she talks ted into accepting gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her the events leading up to this and the resulting game lead the pair on strange adventure in world where individuality doesn exist as the players are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot here the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game perspective don intend to reveal more of the film premise which is structured as computer game with tasks that the characters must complete to win the game released after the matrix and dark city existenz has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films however existenz is moving in different direction with premise of its own combination of dazzling special effects brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot made the matrix rare and entertaining science fiction experience with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade existenz has completely different atmosphere resembling dark city which is darker more serious and less entertaining existenz has the opportunities and potential but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored after the engaging beginning it starts to falter while was watching the film many left the theatre during the first hour and indeed existenz seemed as complete failure the actors seemed unreal the plot and dialogue silly unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another but the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on complete different level explaining all past events the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within few scenes and jet the film fails on several issues probably the best written character in the story is game designer who would rather spend the rest of her life in virtual world than face real life this is great possibility to create magnificent character and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg script to the limits but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown existenz is not world of which you might dream about in your fantasies it is not world worth sacrificing your life for it cold dark place where the players are forced to interrelate with unreal characters eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will it doesn look like place worth even thinking about david cronenberg has been the creator of the fly videodrome and the dead zone so it not so hard to guess that existenz is violent and gory film besides the regular murders of innocent people the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of two headed mutated amfibium scenes like that have become trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he can make film without flowing blood and foul creatures the way see it this is the film crucial failure it is impossible for cronenbergto create beautiful world where time space and problems of our everyday life do not exist place of blooming blossoms green forests and clear waters place really worth sacrificing your life for because of its lack of three dimensionality the film looses most of its possibilities but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes amusing performances especially by willem dafoe and one interesting and important thought depicted in many different ways throughout the movie during the film the audience is as confused as the characters detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created the matrix despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts ends with light at the end of the tunnel existenz does not it is one time experience ending in blood gore and madness rather frightening forecast for tomorrow
lake placid is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie ok so maybe it is but this one is enjoyable and clever actually it comes off more of comedy than horror film well the ending is kinda scary but in most horror comedies they are will admit that lake placid isn an oscar worthy film but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny bridget fonda plays palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating is forced to go to lake placid and investigate tooth after man is bit in half she gets there but really doesn understand why she is there bill pullman plays man also investigating what happened along with the sherriff and rich croc obsessed man they go out and find what is going on what they find though isn great huge and mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid over 150 years old he has migrated here for who knows why they have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from betty beyaz plays woman who lives on the shores of lake placid and well you ll have to see the movie to find out her character is very funny and foul mouthed which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad but funny to me the movie came off as spoof of jaws with the opening sequence and some others it is not original and is when you watch this movie you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it david kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does great job the characters have smartmouths two foul and some great one liners but believe me don take lake placid too seriously or you won like it but it is movie that can be enjoyed as fun popcorn type movie but guess it rates above the popcorn rating sit back watch the movie laugh scream and whatever you want even though the movie is and put violence and gore there really not that much gore but what there is might seem kinda gross to some lake placid is smart clever funny and scary movie that enjoyed and think you will too
the ring is probably one of the creepiest movies ve seen in years but then again ve always had this phobia of asian born horror films remember when was kid was scared as hell with those green faced long haired floating ghosts donning their beyaz gownseuuugh the ring really brings back those memories and its grips me long after the movie has ended unlike the horror films coming from the west pretty much used to the gore and visual effects so much so they become rather bland nowadays there really no scary movie from the west for long time if you have something in mind please tell me this japanese flick is supposed to be based upon stories written by `the stephen king of japan which is also heard televised over the air in japan the film revolves around mysterious videotape which will bring death for sure to the person who watches it one week prior to viewing journalist and her husband stupid enough tests the so call `urban legend and ends up having week before she meets her doom she and her husband then goes on search for the origin of the videocassette to get to the root of the whole curse with the hopes of freeing themselves the ring plays on the senses like no other horror film today visual subtlety minimal music and an intriguing plot puts the audience within an aura of suspense throughout the entire film very well done indeed especially for film that does not have single trace of violence and gore now thats something budding horror film maker wannabes should consider looking into just an idea of how visually powerful the film is it is in japanese and subtitled in chinese both of which can understand at all ok had friend who gave me gist prior to watching but he revealed very little the twists in the plot leading to an unforgettable climax will definitely leave an impression on the audience will have you at the edge of your seat

some critics including siskel ebert are on the record stating that martin scorsese raging bull the story of boxer jake la motta is the best film of the 80s since there are still number of 80s films that haven seen don feel qualified to make such judgment but ll say this without hesitation raging bull is great motion picture and would be surprised if more than handful of films released between january 1980 and december 31 1989 come close to its level bio pics often fall into one of two categories overblown hero worship or dry dull textbook account it rare that movie with the moniker based on the life of comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining raging bull is the perfect counterexample and brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta middleweight icon from the 40s and 50s and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen for all 129 minutes director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro in the title role have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic sad and horrifying historically raging bull is said to be mostly accurately with the lion share of the details culled from la motta own autobiography which was co written with joseph carter and peter savage however although la motta is credited as the movie consultant he was reportedly unhappy with the final result because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth insensitive lout the la motta of the movie is man of extreme appetites who is driven by base bestial impulses paranoia jealousy and blind rage sex and violence are inextricably linked the title is apt la motta is raging bull in the ring he is terror not just beating his opponents but destroying them outside of it he is no less vicious or more easily controlled the two people who spar with him on life canvas are his wife vicki cathy moriarty and his brother manager joey joe pesci these are the two who mean the most to jake and who as result of his inability to trust himself or others he loses he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity and when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him his lets loose with an explosion of violence raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta an up and coming fighter is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class over the years he wins several key bouts including one against his arch rival sugar ray robinson johnny barnes but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in championship match meanwhile away from the ring la motta falls in love with 15 year old vicki who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife vicki becomes jake greatest prize wife in his view is not companion but possession and the source of his most extreme pain his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him hence he is constantly haunted by belief that she is sleeping with someone else perhaps even his brother this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere are you king my wife in the late 40s la motta gets his first shot at championship fight but with one huge condition he must take fall he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing two years later he wins the championship only to lose it in subsequent bout to sugar ray by the late 50s and early 60s when the film ends jake has become pathetic figure broke overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of minor has lost his wife and children and is trying to earn few bucks by doing cheap standup routine raging bull is the other side of rocky sylvester stallone tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 it won the 1977 best picture oscar and sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production but where rocky romanticizes boxing raging bull takes cold unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring while scorsese primary aim is to present riveting deconstruction of la motta the man he never backs away from showing the seedy ugly underside of sport where gambling greed and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working rocky shows boxing at its noblest raging bull shows it at its most diseased there little can say here that hasn already said about de niro performance in career that has included many fine roles this is his most outstanding the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering and although there lot of travis bickle de niro character in taxi driver in la motta scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that if we never fully sympathize with him at least we understand the forces that drive him this is complete characterization and perfect example of acting as the younger jake de niro is trim and fit as the fat older man de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into grotesque parody of its normal form how many actors would go that far the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work although neither won their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro pesci who has basically re created the same personality in two other scorsese films goodfellas and casino presents joey as slightly more intelligent version of his brother the misogyny and violence are still there only better concealed but when joey snaps as he does in one scene where he pounds on mobster frank vincent it startling to behold moriarty on the other hand must play the temptress with virginal qualities the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake later she called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black and white few home movie segments are in color the choice is perfect for the movie giving raging bull unique look in an era when black and white approach is almost unheard of one important recent exception schindler list eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did in black and white especially considering scorsese choice of shots and use of slow motion the violence is stark and disturbing there no room for romanticism in the ring with inky siyah blood staining the canvas during fight sequences the director also uses number of point of view shots designed to show the world however briefly from la motta perspective scorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta loss to sugar ray where he surrendered his middleweight crown after that his career was all downhill yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment stretching more than decade into la motta future the reason is obvious scorsese isn as interested in boxing as he is in the character following his retirement la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies we see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to parody of his former self who cannot feel surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando speech from on the waterfront coulda been contenda perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the 80s and if not it certainly perilously close to the zenith
an avid fan of the alien saga so this review is obviously tad biased at least admitted it of course that doesn mean that gonna be giving this four star review or something because alien resurrection the fourth film in the cool as hell series is not an absolutely amazing film much like the first two were however it very good film which never fails to entertain and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series in short had good time alien resurrection leaves off 200 years after the last one where our heroine protagonist ellen ripley sigourney weaver the science fiction genre answer to job had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one of course the last one wasn very great or anything liked it though not as much as the first two and more importantly it wasn financially successful tawdry 55 million bucks so back we are with ripley back as clone which means we get another little satirical look at cloning not that that bad thing but it becoming cliche so she cloned aboard an even more futuristic looking ship called the auriga by some doctors including the necessary bad government guy dr wren played by freeman as well as the little seen dr gediman played by none other than brad douriff mainly because they have version of her with the alien still inside her once you get past the fact that you can figure out where they got her blood although think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one the film okay also on board are band of mercenary pirates including michael wincott ron perlman kim flowers raymond cruz dominique pinon jeunet sytable and winona ryder who plays analee call who turns out to have bit of secret won state it but unless you ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years you probably know all about it although it nicely covered up there bit of non sexual yet slightly homoerotic relationship between her and ripley but it never really deepened enough oh well well as you might have guessed the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship including some shocks dan hedaya for instance who death is comical yet sad since well he dan hedaya and the remaining people about or are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth of course the plot is all balderdash and just an excuse for some good old alien brand fun the real focus of the series seems to be on style not really substance although there always bit of it most notably in aliens with the relationship between ripley and the little girl what interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach alien is claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights aliens is wild tense thriller alien is bleak moody piece of semi noir alien is kind of like an off beat french film filled with lots of humor and cool scares jean pierre jeunet without his usual directing partner marc caro creates ship filled with the kind of scares films like das boot has with echoes hinting at possible threat the chills in the film are really cool especially with the music which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes there the most tense surgery scene since face off towards the beginning and not every chill turns into bloody mess or anything like that this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others there are even couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed one is the aforementioned surgery scene another one takes place between call and ripley which is just awesome the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense thrilling and jaw dropping scenes in the entire saga with small allusion to jeunet earlier film delicatessen and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool with lovely allusion to goldfinger but the best scene in the entire film sure not the first to mention it takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her she has an tatooed on her arm it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga the screenplay by joss whedon is not great piece of work as it never really deapens lot of the characters however it does make us care about most of them so that when there very little of them and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow we are pretty scared and yeah there are some very funny lines ripley who do have to fuck to get off this boat johner well can get you off but not this ship the acting is good all around with stand out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner and leland orser the poor bastad in se7en who performed the lust sin as an anxiety ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him winona ryder is good but not amazing like she usually is although she meshes well with the film of course and as usual sigourney weaver steals the show playing variation on the ripley character less emotional and more rude and bitter she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable she not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for aliens but she just awesome overall it thrilling entertaining film which doesn really amaze like the first two but is much more amazing than the third installment the style is the best part of the film which isn really bad thing but it being the best part takes away from lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply but it entertaining as hell and it definitely fit for the alien series
it may seem weird to begin film about glam rock with sequence that includes spaceship green ovular pin and the birth of oscar wilde but if one really strains they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off wilde philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned loosing his family and his career the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had similar take and came to similar demise the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else and that why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began it been said that todd haynes velvet goldmine the film that chronicles what it was like to be part of the movement not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it steals lot from citizen kane and that true in the film british journalist in the 80s arthur stuart christian bale is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade fictitious rock star who faked his own death on stage bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement structure wise this totally steals from kane not only from the set up he interviews three people and the story is result of their flashbacks but in other things like the beginning death then newsreel and smaller details like the bitter ex friend in wheelchair and the bitter ex wife as washed up lounge singer found in bar after hours this is no kane and it really doesn aspire to be it doesn attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like kane did and it doesn really uncover anything poignant about humanity instead it uses the flashbacks as form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants the 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy equipped with performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging but the 70s scenes are engaging though not to mention addictively campy they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era and feel that so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then footage they become not only symbol of decadence but of times when everything seemed so simple instead of creating the world the way it was haynes paints their own world as if it were narcotic fairy tale the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you ve experienced it everything else seems so mundane there no outside world to speak of secluding these people inside protective globe that will eventually crack haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero curt wild and their relationship that created molded and then brought down the movement reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that contributors blade played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers and wild played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop respectively complete with the creation of ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one time partners in music but also partners in bed through discussions with slade ex manager cecil michael feast ex wife mandy toni collette reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes british accent when with slade and finally ex partner wild journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality when he opens up his first slade record he finds naked and green slade lying on crimson blanket and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene finally resulting in leading boring job in america haynes demonstrates that he quite the visual auteur molding scenes that are like long heald breaths such as seemingly long sequence juxtaposing slade wild concert of them performing brian eno cover baby on fire with scenes from decadent drug party and the film most wow inspiring sequence the first concert scene of wild with his band the ratttz where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy esuqe movements including stripping naked and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers major talent and another slade discovers his idle even the brief music videos spoofs of bowie have rare visual flair that pure camp and which would cause ken russell to drool the best sequence though may be the beginning following the prelude sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post movement era in it stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be real assasination which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet with brian eno famous needle in the camel eye playing in the background the scene has detached exhileration the song doesn seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are it has distance that hard to put finger on and it seems to represent that all this is coming to quick and sad ending and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show docked in silver frock with wings and mavi hair depressingly staring into the mirror it comes off as none too obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film this movie not so much about plot but more about the way it is presented making this one of those films which is classified as being style over substance statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack however for the most part the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world by using his sets costumes cinematography and especially the music to play as characters in his film the music is especially notable the soundtrack which is wall to wall consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno rex and roxy music as well as covers by slade band with vocals by thom yorke and occasionally rhys meyers himself and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie like the cast is rather impressive but no one really walks away with the film and no performances are extremely good although eddie izzard as slade manager who challenges slade first manager to an arm wrestling match to see who gets control of his career and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly and collette and mcgregor have their moments rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub par neither putting lot of effort into their respective roles some of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes rhys meyers brian slade remains merely metaphor for the glam rock era dying when he turned into retro garbo resorting to life of salinger ism and found in the mid 70s to be lying around sniffing coke off the ass of party girl in fact no one in this film is really seen as person rather than just as symbol or composite of type who thrived during the era bale character is an especially tough sell bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood he not an extremely personal character and his cliched experiences being hounded by the record store guys for buying record put out by poof never help us communicate with him nevertheless rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them and others bitter part of which helps the film work since this is major piece of eye candy at the prime of the movie they at least look the role of fashionable leaders slade with his perpetually changing androgonys persona and wild with his topless and unpredictable image which clash and fuse into an unstable union their story of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into similar who cares attitude crossed with camp is engaging without the personal background the story of stuart though is tougher sell because he the everyman and when you can totally identify with the everyman your story in slight trouble as cultural rock piece velvet goldmine is rather good but it is merely good it never totally takes off although it has moments where it absolutely flies but then comes back down it really nothing more than bunch of really great moments surrounded by material that could really be much better the beginning is captivating but slow the middle is fantastic and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that it drags the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion it could probably stop at any point and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past which is commendable but not totally so still it does what the oliver stone pic the doors didn do right becoming very insightful to what happened using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems half assed suppose the message is live life but after you ve lived it what else is the point when you ll be forced to live with regretful memories the really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that

imagine this scenario you and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long excruciating cross country car trips far from the city and into the deserted rural routes so far the trip is idyllic when abruptly your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere it is not an easy situation but perfectly plausible one the panorama in which breakdown musters it throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness it is not easy to cobble distinct and gripping thriller nowadays but breakdown doesn bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives masterful titillating climax that by it finale engrosses viewer with total absorption the plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988 the vanishing kurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor massachusetts couple en route to california for brand new job when they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest jeff is confronted by pugnacious driver who later will be an important player in the plot department minutes later after that their brand new strikingly kirmizi jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops jeff cannot detect the car problem so he allows amy to take ride with kirmizi walsh heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town where jeff will meet her at local diner it is facile for the film to turn into pseudo suspenser but instead it opts for maximum fervor jeff manages to re start the car himself but when he arrives at the diner she is nowhere in sight disconcerted the coffee shop bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife town about twenty miles from here there trouble arises and shall not reveal anything else since that would be spoiling the fun of what head there are many involving tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes magnificent chase with three cars and huge truck will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam it is pleasure to be part of classic confrontation of good vs evil and rooting for the good guys in this case jeff kurt russell is one of the few top notch hollywood actors which doesn overblow his acting and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses so you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letter perfect suffice it is to say he undergoes transformation from jolly man to guy frantically pursuing loved one not many well paid actors can deliver these type of performances but russell is one of them as an everyday man he pulls it off extremely convincingly what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes although the film is blotted with couple of portentous action sequences very well done yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with faced with an enigma about his wife whereabouts the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters including the cryptic villains who in essence make the movie what it is what most impressive however is the feature debut by writer director jonathan mostow mostow hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of siyah angle alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nail biting suspense sought for in well made affair contrary to most american thrillers he doesn rely on visual flair but on aesthetics and substance after breakdown he should gain vast notoriety the villains in the movie aren your routine out of this world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective the baddies in breakdown all well acted are normal seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder the movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks and of all things in the world it is becoming rather easy to root for villains jon voight in anaconda in today movies worth special mentioning is walsh who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision as the leader of the gang he renders deliciously wicked performance temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for alfred hitchcock used suspense and action not only to stimulate but as way of aiding his audience fascination in his stories which were slowly realizing man biggest fears breakdown yields exactly that it magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man acting like an ordinary man looking like an ordinary and some sort of superhero despite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock think would approve of breakdown 33
plot group of asbestos cleaners get job removing the gunk from an old insane asylum as each day passes the crew members begin to discover things about the place and themselves which set other things in motion saying anything else about the plot would be crime have fun critique feel like shooting myself in the head are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie good indication as to what kind of film to expect here this ain your average happy go lucky kind of picture this is deliberately slow paced mystery horror film drenched in atmosphere with very creepy insane asylum in which most of the film takes place very few clues up front and lots to talk about afterwards will it bore some people to sleep you bet it will is it made for the scream audiences of the day absolutely not guess you can describe this film as horror movie for the cerebral crowd film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame giving away very little with each step and each sound unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up world of revelations and plenty more to discuss later ve always loved movies that have me talking about them afterwards like the shining and lost highway and this film fits right into that group in fact guess can pussyfoot around the actual word all want but the best way to describe this kind of movie is mindfuck if you feel like watching movie that moves very slowly gives you handful of characters with divergent backgrounds tosses few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together well then this movie is definitely for you it the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate damn missed that whole peanut butter thing and one that will likely creep the shit out of you if watched alone in the dark brrrrrrrrr now what was that sound in the basement honey can you go check and one thing this film doesn have unlike its hollywood ian counterparts like the haunting is special effects in fact that one of the greater things about this movie it feels real because it looks like it actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances did some research and it was in fact shot on digital video ah ha another great thing about it is that it actually very gory and somewhat violent in theme and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen it mostly implied kids and as clich as it might be to say it usually much scarier when stuff is left to our imagination or implied in movies as such other films that this one reminded me of include henry portrait of serial killer and the blair witch project with that same real sense of dread brooding and terror the film does however move awfully slow and if you really don get into it completely you really need to concentrate here you will lose the motion of the story and the pent up tension might be released but overall this film is yet another great example of the horror genre making very cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sight and with david caruso acting like the king hotshot like only he can how can you go wrong definitely not film for everyone but must see for anyone looking to throw themselves into the psyche of the disturbed count me in stanley kubrick would be proud oh yeah so where that gun again where joblo coming from the blair witch project 10 blair witch 10 the haunting 10 the house on haunted hill 10 lost highway 10 10 the pledge 10 the shining 10 the sixth sense 10 unbreakable 10
as fairy tales go cinderella has to be one of the most famous almost everyone knows it well at least in north america so it is natural that someone will try to make movie out of it it has been done before with varying results this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time the basic story remains unchanged but one thing that seems to vanish with this version and that is all the fantastical elements of the story there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least unlike in the fairy tale the prince plays much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end the prince who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france meets cinderella known as danielle on few occasions most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her although this seems to be far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling the story takes place in renaissance setting in france with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion this addition of leonardo da vinci was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie since some of the roles are bit stereotypical for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves few things to be desired for instance the character seems to be bit too unstable and fickle crown prince should not be anything remotely like that especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne the characters of danielle cinderella played by drew barrymore and that of the evil step mother played by anjelica huston are well developed and well played by the two women although the part of danielle is bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable the nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie as contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique but anjelica huston seems to add certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly the actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise all in all this movie takes you back into history into seemingly magical fairy land but don get me wrong there is nothing but reality it is just refreshing to watch movie that is not based in familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening so although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not and that adds dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing

rented brokedown palace last night blind having heard nothing about it beforehand and enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws for anyone wishing to have the same experience would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety that is no easy task superficially it bears an unfortunate and not necessarily unintended resemblance to several other movies notably return to paradise and midnight express as result nearly every review of brokedown palace subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons the consequence was nearly universal condemnation which is shame as this is fine film for those who have yet to view the movie let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system as was midnight express nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of return to paradise in my view if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad acclaimed novel lord jim problematically the basic storyline seems more than familiar two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set up involving suave con man shadowy criminal conspiracy and corrupt third world justice system the girls are alice claire danes and darlene kate beckinsale they re life long buddies who planned high school graduation trip to hawaii and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents once there they find $6 hotel and go sight seeing which includes sneaking into luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them but they are saved from hotel security by charming friendly australian nick daniel lapaine who takes care of the bill with more polished execution of the girl scam he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves first toward alice then toward darlene by now alarm bells are going off among viewers the ever present nick is too slick and his stories don add up to us the girls of course are too naive to notice long before it happens we re anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag literally containing heroin just as predictably the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison bound for long stretch left unanswered is the kirmizi herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was willing accomplice for those in need of ready answer might suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl fleabag hotel as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer fixer yankee hank bill pullam and his thai born partner wife recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film tag lines who do you trust and hank is no exception although seasoned movie goers and those familiar with pullman oeuvre will find few surprises much of the remainder of the movie is smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short hand fashion lou diamond phillips for instance plays delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank withholds vital information at crucial moments is he part of wider conspiracy with an inherently powerful if somewhat tired premise the film offers by parts riveting courtroom drama prison story and potential character study of american teens their relationship and what constitutes friendship between them the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful with the girls interaction hank investigation and the various trials and hearings offering hope for their release delivering tension as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape if brokedown palace has major flaw it is its creators tendency like time constrained tourists to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half way down and return to the story main avenue and if that were all there was to brokedown palace it wouldn be very good movie but believe the writers and director were after bigger game and in this they succeeded for the main theme of the movie like the proffered name of its location is freedom in all its permutations ultimately the other sub themes may be considered window dressing young and pretty alice danes is an old soul wild streetwise teenager with thirst for freedom and adventure presented as perfect blend of yin and yang dark and light is her cautious best friend darlene beckinsale clear eyed and straightforward alice is more complex than her friend she comes from poorer background has reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone including her own father whereas darlene life is on track aimed at college marriage kids career suburban home middle age and fulfillment alice is uncertain unfocused and yearning one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors friends and relatives from home whose lives continue while hers is in limbo tellingly alice is present but not included just as revealing of their different personalities when alice and dar first come to thailand the openness and delight on alice face doesn read as simple naivet the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in small boat reaching toward the sun she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom while dar remains seated in the shade brokedown palace begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in tape recording sent to hank however unintentional it all alice fault she responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of film beginning darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison dar of course is the willing dupe which in her view confers innocence never mind that it was her coercion of reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate dar is innocent it doesn matter alice is the subject of this movie she and her journey toward personal freedom along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half baked sensibilities and materialistic goals in the end that culture like its representatives yankee hank and dar father man who knows how to grease the wheels proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl tragedy thailand culture contrary to most opinion comes off much better by comparison it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes believe the filmmaker view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior the thai with the sole exceptions of corrupt official and spiteful prison spy were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles the girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native born their prison in stark contrast to the probable reality was no hellhole being relatively clean and sunlit the prison authorities demanded good hygiene provided medical care when needed and hard manual labor consisted of picking grass the thai guards were authoritarian what else but certainly not routinely sadistic as for the thai justice system the reasoning of the thai judges during both an appeal hearing and in the film penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality freedom has many faces and brokedown palace explores many of them in the extreme we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter but freedom seldom comes without price which is why the movie other tag lines are what is your dream and how far would you go believe could make good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom incarcerated or not by film end is alice she finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact kate beckinsale character might more properly be likened to the released temple bird referred to twice during the film trained to fly back to its cage as the thai magistrate observed in the film climactic scene the issue was always one of character and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that freedom is achieved within oneself if one thinks back over the movie which character was transformed by their experiences increasingly the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of kung fu woman female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures here at last is the story of modern heroine in reading the many user comments was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon whether or not person liked the movie almost everyone praised the actors think about that when was the last time you came away from motion picture possibly hating it but raving about all the performances in it do yourself favor rent brokedown palace and watch it with open mind there more there than meets the eye
ve never been huge fan of jeff bridges but loved him in the big lebowski the part of jeff the dude lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind and the fit is perfect the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles hippie slob on bowling team with soft spot for beyaz russians he enjoying leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy but not before they urinate on his rug the dude assumes that these collection agents were after another jeff lebowski famous millionaire who also lives in so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug the millionaire refuses but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped he wants the dude to act as go between for the kidnapers dude and his friend walter john goodman take on the task and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers millionaires high schoolers nihilists artists pornographers thugs and league bowlers comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres so take my recommendation as you will for me the big lebowski is very funny it is an incredibly successful comedy the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films not only are the two leads bridges and goodman funny separately and together but each supporting character is refreshing comic figure all the characters end up as the butt of jokes but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived each person may be comic caricature but there is always respectful self acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension the characters are firmly established and they never change their behavior for quick cheap laugh it not what they do that funny it who they are which is why the acting is so important and so successful in this movie worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus that jee zus not hay soos the greaser bowler who in lusty marriage with the game julianne moore as the post post feminist artist whose work has been described as vaginal steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter and sam elliott as the rambling long winded narrator aside from the performances what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue people lose trains of thought they interrupt they boast they repeat themselves they repeat their friends they sound natural taken with fargo the coen brothers last film it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers ethan coen is not just good at directing actors he also good at technical directing he and cinematographr roger deakins created beautiful world on film perhaps beautiful is the wrong word nihilists carpet pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty but the bowling photography and series of viking bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film all around the big lebowski is great solid comedy outstanding acting writing direction and photography all combine to make this great comic success
group of high school kids mix up with group of hip hop artists as documentarian strives to discover why today youth seem attracted to siyah culture the review if siyah beyaz the new film from writer director james toback is eventually remembered for only one thing it will be the revelation that brooke shields claudia schiffer marla maples and mike tyson can act however this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that black beyaz is fascinating film it makes statement about america youth and hip hop culture without getting heavy handed overly serious featuring cast of known commodities ben stiller robert downey jr and hot newcomers singers bijou phillips toback is complex film worth seeing black beyaz has multiple storylines that are all related to each other la robert altman there is dean the basketball player allan houston who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear stiller in exchange for fifty grand game this eventually spills over into the life of dean long time friend rich power gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem rich has to deal with the imminent opening of white owned club on his turf meanwhile the young beyaz girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in documentary by sam donager shields and her gay husband terry downey jr others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young beyaz punk will joe pantoliano as his district attorney father jared leto as high school teacher marla maples as the mother of one of hip hop crazed teens claudia schiffer as dean girlfriend and mike tyson as mike tyson the stories ebb and flow through the film losing and gaining prominence over time friendships are lost lovers are gained and there is an occasional burst of violence originally rated nc 17 in the united states siyah beyaz features lot of sex between siyah gangstas and young beyaz girls while the film was trimmed down to tamer rating viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing the three way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for and several audience members got up and left at that point the frequent sex is one of the film few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film to toback credit the level of violence in siyah beyaz is almost nil these gangstas and hip hop artists are given real problems and concerns and only become gun toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way whenever character finds himself on donager handheld digital camera he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence but not everyone has fully bought into the idea charlie phillips is full of bluster about why she loves hip hop but admits that in ten years time ll be way over this these youth know they are going through phase and are simply enjoying it toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny most of the humour comes from mike tyson who provides the film comic relief without really trying he is given big words like vernacular to say and as rich tries to discuss particular street problem with tyson he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better playing on tyson image as dimwit but tyson also gets the film scariest moment as he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry tyson is marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm the scene is entirely improvised with downey jr being told to just keep at tyson until he gets reaction the reaction he gets being slapped and then choked is astonishing as downey jr face turns frightening shade of purple black beyaz is film about hip hop culture and the film omnipresent hip hop soundtrack strongly supports this but toback keeps things from becoming too serious by moving from story to story as quickly as he does toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character struggle thus siyah white message about hip hop becomes secondary to the film itself toback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn little about hip hop along the way and we do
at first glance three kings looks to be just another war movie the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names cannot remember the 90s version it definitely is just another war movie not in your dreams imagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan thats three kings for you believe it or not it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter the story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war with the allied troops victorious majpr archie gates clooney leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to rather unorthodox post war looting spree the millions in altin bars secretly stowed away by saddam in desolate village in the desert as the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home this `wild bunch goes awol on an armed hum vee the vehicle of choice of the us army they soon find out that they have much resistance as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddams forces frequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men they become consciously attacked by their own morals as the film begins to roll it seemed to have rather `light mood to it `special effects such as when gates describes to his men how bullet can kill simply paves the way for light hearted funny action movie three kings is much smarter than that as the conflict becomes more and more complex the audience will be trapped in limbo trying to stay focussed on that light mood serious mood that the film seem to portray personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant action sequences are not shot as your old fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs in your face war violence they are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight close ups and pauses right before the action starts not john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style tons of them starring clint eastwood great performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film the screenwriter and the director three kings ranks among the best films of the year well for me at least highly recommended
ve always been told that there are two things in life that are unavoidable death and taxes oddly ve never given much thought to either of the two maybe if did at least stop getting collection notices from uncle sam yes let me make resolution to devote myself to better record keeping hold on to all my receipts and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are mistake free and will keep me from incurring penalties it seems that the issue of death may not be so different at least envisioned here in this film as this tender love story goes if you do good things and have clear conscience when you die you ascend to place of great peace and beauty the dreams wishes and fantasies that you had when you were alive come true for those who die with burdened soul however they wind up in that other place chris and annie winsome robin williams and radiant annabella sciorra seem like the perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has to offer their love for each other is strong and their bond is undeniable but tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric of annie happiness and when chris dies after terrible car accident she commits suicide tortured soul who blames herself despair is perhaps the greatest sin and she will wallow in her guilt throughout eternity chris on the other hand has made it to heaven and upon learning of annie fate he journeys to hell to find her and to try to free her from her nightmare this film brims with imagination containing lush imagery that shows the arcadia that is heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that is hell it seems that heaven and hell could very well be product of our fantasies or nightmares it shape and look is as infinite as our imagination as chris explores his new fantastic world and discovers things both amazing and wondrous he also begins to learn more about himself certain questions baffle him at first why does his home in heaven ooze with paint what is the significance of the asian stewardess why does he have an all too willing guide cuba gooding jr to help him find annie but as he slowly begins to realize the answers it makes him stronger and gives him greater chance to save annie dreams is both visually and tellingly beautiful alas have one regret the movie did well to gather more and more emotional speed but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying it seemed as if it was racing to some kind of great finish but its intensity seemed to wane in its final moments however your eyes will still well up with tears and you ll find lots to savor the storytelling is purposeful and well constructed the journey is imaginative and was surprised by how much enjoyed this film
the bond series is an island in the film world where else would we look forward to cliches and all of the other things that occur in most of these films where else would pure escapism vulnerable hero the talking villains blatant product placement predictable action sequences and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of significant change don understand it myself but that what the bond series is based on for think 18 films we ve mostly got the same thing over and over again with some variation and bit of change most notably in the two dalton films but even king of cynicism can bitch about it and tomorrow never dies the again think eighteenth bond film and second brosnan bond film is no exception thank god the plot as in most of them is pure balderdash but seems to have nice kind of edge to it instead of just plain billionaire psychotics we get rupert murdoch esque media mogul psychotic elliot carver jonathan pryce looking bitching with white haired cru cut and always talking like he out of breath who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating war no this is not wag the dog he wants real war between china and england and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it in comes bond james is sent all around the world trying to do research on carver fighting with his men and running into on more than one occasion chinese secret agent like him wai lin michelle yeoh asian action star extraordinaire and co star of supercop nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one the two eventually and predictably of course begin working together and yes there is some sexual tension between the two luckily their relationship is never strained and she never gives into his cassanova ness until the finale thank god again in every bond film james bags on average three women sometimes more sometimes less the latter being more potent towards the aids cautionary dalton and he doesn spoil this one though we never see them of course mean they need to stay around pg 13 rating there always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again the big bond girl yeoh and this time we have an almost cameo by teri hatcher as carver wife paris who it seems was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning yes teri very attractive but she seems kind of dull of course it not really her fault her part is under written and she only in small part of it oh well and there are always the big henchmen the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains this time we get tall arian looking not to mention robert shaw in from russia with love looking guy named stamper goetz otto who is pretty awesome although bit stiff well mostly his posture really and for bit of comedy we get cameo from vincent shiavelli as german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point the government people have small parts as usual with desmond llewelyn looking near death sadly getting only one scene in more grouchy mood than usual and judi dench getting more than usually gets mean it is judi dench and for no reason whatsoever except cause he was so good in goldeneye joe don baker shows up again as wade admitting he has no reason for being there and is this time more annoying again oh well the action sequences are not let down although sometimes go on too long they pop up every now and then mainly because they have to for the sake of the series and some significant ones are the opening one one in garage with bmw that runs on remote control and motorcylce chase on bmw cycle nonetheless through china streets or was it vietnam the plot not really essential they re more high tech and feature much more laughs which yeah dig so what if they re distracting they re supposed to be the acting from most around is great yeoh is actually one of the better bond girls mainly because she so unique the better bond girls are more independent and have certain wily ness to them pussy galore with her homoerotic undertones and all is one of the best and diana rigg who married bond at the end of on her majesty secret service only to be killed added some emotional depth yeoh is notable since she so active and has great chemistry with brosnan pryce is an awesome villain being slimy and lovable at the same time and brosnan is once again the mack daddy the bond series is built on cliches mainly because they re so fun and add to the escapism if you can remember the dalton years and they re serious direction you remember how unsuccessful they were both financially and aesthetically the series would falter if bogged down with too much plot too many themes and too much characterization don really understand it myself yet one of the bigger fans of the series in the northeast united states having seen all of them more than once yes ve seen this twice already you can tell adore them while it not one of the best like goldfinger or from russia with love tomorrow never dies is nonetheless truly awesome installment even if not being as fully amazing as some of the better ones
plot during 10 week span in london in the fall of 1888 jack the ripper man whose identity was never uncovered committed five ritualistic grisly murders of prostitutes this film is based on the graphic novel which assembled theory behind the century old mystery critique awesome love dark movies love stylish movies love good mysteries and love johnny depp so yes really dug this movie the hughes brothers are back with vengeance out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously and this movie my friends is very serious in fact it also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and siyah as hell it ain for the kids ll tell you that much and if any of those recent hack directors of two bit scream esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective kill scenes do not look any further because each one committed to this film is cinematic stunner especially when compared to their generic slice and dice contrivances in fact most of this film structure is very creative the actors all solid the atmosphere and feel of the picture remarkably real gotta love those unfortunates and the descent into darkness well honed by the filmmakers you can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time but it also an impressive mystery film based on the true life tale of jack the ripper man whose identity was never discovered the theory in this film is based on the graphic novel from hell written by alan moore and presents compelling story which despite being little oliver stone ish did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem sexual depravity drug usage insanity murders and love yes the brothers even managed to slip little love story in here and despite not truly being developed guess it could ve been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already that right there no real need to put any romance in film about mass murderer but that aside you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities to center this movie all the way through sure he just playing less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow but he does it so well and even added michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film was sure that her presence would ruin this movie but she was fine and how little the dreams fantasies of depp character had to do with the film development from what had seen in the trailer thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story but thankfully it wasn on the downside the film doesn really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development but then again story about the most mysterious serial killer of all time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement mean the less knew about each person the more suspicious became of each one motives reasons etc in fact was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end and that was in part due to the distance to which been held from the film characters or am giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention perhaps overall this is an extremely creepy production with glorious cinematography reminiscent of coppola dracula and burton sleepy hollow grim score and solid acting but it not for everyone some may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events and even though the murders aren shown as graphically as you might think there enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors but for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery and palpable gothic atmosphere and this flick is just that and plenty more and god knows that will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the ripper haunting cape silhouette and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon brrrrr where joblo coming from the crow 10 dark city 10 dracula 10 jfk 10 the nightmare before christmas 10 10 the ninth gate 10 the others 10 quills 10 shadow of the vampire 10 sleepy hollow 10
jean luc picard patrick stewart and the rest of the crew of the enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the 1960 series star trek gone are kirk spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek the next generation as usual crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off planet against the colonist will it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just few hundred colonists of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists insurrection is lighter movie than the last two star trek films the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as whole outweighs the rights of small group in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction it doesn do bad job other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek fan only jokes while many of the others just fall flat the other criticism that had with the story was that it ignores common sense there are only few hundred people on this whole planet why do they have to be moved the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal murray abraham aliens who number only couple of dozen so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have few hundred being booted out for few billion at least that plausible but in reality we have few hundred being moved for the benefits of few dozen which makes no sense whatsoever the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf michael dorn the trusty klingon worf was on star trek the next generation so they want to include him in the films no problem so far worf is now character of star trek deep space nine so the writers have to find way to have him show up in the last star trek movie first contact the included worf in credible fashion in this one the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren hanging on every word on the screen my minor problems with the movie aside star trek insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones while many of the jokes do miss the mark many are pretty good even for non trekkies the special effects are among the best for the star trek series the action is plentiful and well done this is very good looking movie it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek the next generation that the acting is first rate it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over decade they interact with each other with skill that few other ensemble casts can muster most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series if you ve always hated star trek there is nothing here that is going to change your mind star trek insurrection is not the best film in the series but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones
it might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy made their feature film debut with blood simple grim and often gruesome tale of revenge murder and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas it bears some resemblance story wise to the coens recent fargo but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here blood simple is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end the premise of blood simple is really just slight variation on the standard love triangle revenge scheme sleazy bar owner julian marty dan hedaya hires shifty private detective emmet walsh to kill his wife abby frances mcdormand and her illicit lover ray john getz things start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but upon collecting the money becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme to reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much but what ensues is series of bloody and do mean bloody confrontations each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening every act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator eyes but we the audience are made privy to the big picture and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person this aspect of the story along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality one gets the sense that if guns and in one case shovels were not available some of these characters would claw each other to death are the most effective components of the film the coens might have done well to title the film fear and loathing in texas some have labeled blood simple as modern day noir but while am not an expert on either genre it seems more like horror movie than anything else the coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters and the final sequence is nothing more than showdown between the one relatively innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive that said blood simple is very good horror movie the fear and suspense here are genuine the coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards such as when character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on gun discharging it as it skitters across the floor or when murder attempt unfolds in way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film that said blood simple is not exactly flawless for one thing the motivations for the killings are still little thin at times can understand that the characters had tracks to cover or at least thought they did but found it little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder and although they at least didn have anyone get hacked to death with knife the coens also aren quite immune to horror cliches they indulge in prolonged dead guy seems to have come back to life but then we find out it only dream scene that had me rolling my eyes the film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film blood simple is not quite the masterpiece of neo noir that many seem to think it is but it decent movie and it showcases the coens ability to handle suspense and violence in visceral but non exploitative manner would firmly recommend it to all coen heads as well as anyone looking for something original in thriller
capsule the director of cure brings weird and very complex concept to the screen one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse the idea is something about ghosts and the internet the film has an amazing apocalyptic style +2 to +4 perhaps the most disturbing and disturbed filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa his films all seem to have one style bleak the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold little known in the us to date his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid his 1998 film cure with one of his niftiest ideas is just now getting sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with cure is probably his classic last year he released seance remake of seance on wet afternoon that was perhaps miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into non supernatural story pulse is kurosawa back on form taguchi young computer expert is late with his delivery of some important software two co workers go to his apartment and find it dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment taguchi acting very strangely lets his friends look for the missing software meanwhile he slips behind plastic curtain when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just strange dark mildew like spot on the wall taguchi computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide but they are not entirely dead their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see ghost if they say yes they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing like computer disk instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with kirmizi tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers leave it to kurosawa to find new kind of death this is film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death but whatever it does convey is nightmarish kurosawa who directs his own screenplay ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange junichiro hayashi the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawa films creates dark cold and gloomy tone images are obscured by semi lighting or are behind plastic curtain scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence seeing siyah silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock but deeper metaphysical dread of any horror filmmaker in the world kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch rate this metaphysical look at isolation on the to 10 scale and +2 on the to +4 scale
pleasantville 1998 taps into hollywood lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed www pleasantville com april 1999 friday cast tobey maguire reese witherspoon william macy joan allen walsh jeff daniels mpaa rating pg 13 for sexual content and thematic elements genre drama in my opinion in short it takes lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film one can easily be misled as to what the real message is review in literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life such as rain fire or emotions the town of pleasantville has one adjective pleasant there is no sadness no fear no danger no discomfort no love and no hate put simply it place alanis morissette could really work wonders for one big note however is that it is only 50 sitcom that airs in reruns on an oldies tv station or is it had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day was not disappointed found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back more times in the period it endured at the box office but it wasn until months later when slipped in for small showing in one of those crummy dollar theaters after not having seen it for so long that my eyes were opened to such deeper meaning and perspective than had previously experienced it is far too feasible misconception that this is film which forwards the idea that world without some healthy immorality is not world at all instead the actual message which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that know of is that world without immorality doesn give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself because everything is automatically right there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made no space for growth and never anything new to learn and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story now not saying that necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be besides hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch the visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable after spending the bulk of the movie staring at siyah and beyaz it hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more truly intelligent addition to it all however is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork that said the plot goes as such david and jennifer are two very 90 high school twins with the typical relationship outline of don mess with my life and won mess with yours they demonstrate the well known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today david is the shyer subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv while jennifer is the wild licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation but when freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home nevertheless jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to more unrestrained approach to life and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed and as said earlier not to flip the town around into some corrupt society but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them not only were difficult choices being brought upon the town but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place people got hurt they cried they became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves and that when their physical world turned colors as well this can be looked upon as quite controversial movie but to me the message is finally clear hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run we ll never know what we could have done better until the next great movie see remain sincerely danielle flynn imr

who would have thought jim carrey does drama when first saw the advertisement for the truman show thought what hilarious idea for movie however it was an even better premise for drama the truman show takes us into world that revolves around one man that man is truman burbank jim carrey truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly cristof wants to keep it that way christof is the god of this made up world he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles there were few attempts to tell truman about his world but they failed and life went on as normal the opening parts of the film introduce to truman world we see what he is doing at his current age then we get flashback at his past it may seem tad boring but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start the film can be described in one word weird it seems like such simple idea yet it is something that majority of us would never think of but andrew niccol did it seems like warped idea but it is andrew idea and he did wonders with it jim carrey actually lived up to the hype the hype whether good or bad always focused on carrey ability to do drama no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be the only thing they doubted was carrey and he showed them all up jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars do not think he was the best actor but he deserved the nomination he plays truman burbank the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world he has lived normal life for almost thirty years but then strange things start happening he ventures into the wrong elevator light crashes in front of him his father comes back and is then pulled away we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is show but truman does not and it is just constant progression that never gets sluggish carrey is able to shed his comedy to play major role in major drama laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to point peter weir does not make the cast perfect and their flaws eventually lead to truman escape the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down despite carrey greatness the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris who plays the god of truman world he displays the pressure he is under the world he has created he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of life the action moves at good pace and rarely gets sluggish but the main point of the film is how it looks like television show it really makes you think maybe your brother is an actor maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman arrival and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon noah emmerich delivers his dramatic line all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative was not only enjoying the film was overwhelmed by genius of it overall the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood jim carrey shows that he is not just man of million faces but legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection the truman show is must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film

directed by tom dey rated pg 13 for mild language adult situations drug use martial art action and violence 107 minutes super 35mm panavision 35 what can you say about jackie chan that hasn already been said since the release of rumble in the bronx back in 1996 the release jackie has become fairly recognizable commodity on america video shelves having made over 80 films jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action comedy to the west his latest release shanghai noon is joyful tribute spoof of the classic western and by adding jackie chan into the genre the tag line for the film the western gets kick in the pants rings true jackie stars as chon wang lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china the royal princess pei pei lucy liu is set to be married to the obnoxious son of nobleman from another prefecture unwilling to follow her father wishes princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor decides to escape to america but this is all ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong which will lead to the princess kidnapping and ransom unable to take any legal action the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden city bravest guards played by cui ya hi rong guang yu and eric chen are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city nevada chon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team as he is looked upon as buffoon on train in the jackie meets up with bandit roy bannon owen wilson he is much less of bandit than he is glory hog looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being bandit will bring him with his gang in tow roy attempts to rob the train when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court who also happens to be chon wang uncle chon wang gives chase foiling the attempted robbery but also leaving himself stranded in the desert as the disgraced guard wanders through the desert he again comes upon roy who has been left for dead by his former gang buried up to his neck in the desert roy pleads with chon to dig him out chon demands to know where carson city is roy directs him and chon leaves but not before sticking two chopsticks into roy mouth and telling him to dig himself chon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors friendly sioux tribe gunslingers horse that thinks and behaves like dog and an indian bride brandon merrill before once again running into roy shanghai noon is just good fun the chemistry between the cast is remarkable the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film jackie performance is as good as anything he done before he not called on to do much acting here as the character is not written with any depth but jackie natural charisma shines through and his comic timing is so perfect both physically and surprise verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on owen wilson last seen in the embarrassing remake of the haunting gives good natured performance as roy bannon his innocence is refreshing and fun bad guy that not really bad his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script but for change does not play nymphet or some other deviant the character is noble woman of status and wealth but finds greater cause as result of her own imprisonment the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances nothing here is realistic mind you shanghai noon is first and foremost light jovial film and the performances match that style with ease the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous using calgary alberta as the prime location mr mindel is able to create lush romantic western feel to the film nothing here really looks like nevada but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged the film can be looked upon as loving tribute to earlier films of the genre and as such the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history but with reverence to past films homage to such films as high noon obviously kirmizi river and most notably butch cassidy the sundance kid all bring sense of nostalgia to the film it is comforting experience at time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant here is film that embraces those old attitudes and dare say clich and manages to make them palatable and refreshing here is film that is not contemptuous of the genre this is the purest horse opera since the days of george brian or john wayne director tom dey has crafted loving tribute to hollywood past in this his first film mr dey shows both love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see nothing here really stands out or takes one attention away from the story or action and that is as it should be when jackie chan is your star and what of the action and stunts well while not up to level of drunken master or any of jackie hong kong films shanghai noon is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before his timing choreography and creativity are still as sharp as ever jackie even gets to recreate few scenes from his earlier films obvious to those of us that have seen those films but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar finally jackie can honestly say that he has made an his way and incorporating his style to sum up shanghai noon is fun summer confection not too heavy and not too light fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy parents be advised there are scenes of smoking drunkenness and peyote use an enjoyable and charming film that can and will be enjoyed again and again

while watching shallow grave found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens blood simple both are good films in which several characters none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes the body count rises and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands both films are also flawed but for different reasons blood simple is unrelentingly dark and moody but its characterizations were little hollow shallow grave on the other hand is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they accomplished for more standard audience pleasing ending the events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that honestly felt quite troubled by what was witnessing on screen most of the time yet there was slight grin on my face at the end as the film begins we are introduced to alex ewan mcgregor juliet kerry fox and david christopher eccleston scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow they are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious but other than that they seem like fairly normal bunch man named hugo moves into the apartment remaining vacancy and the next morning he is found dead of drug overdose juliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him suitcase filled to the brim with cash presumably from criminal activities the three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death after drawing of straws the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning all of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film and part of what makes shallow grave so brilliant for while is that honestly had no idea what was coming next other than the obvious question of why they don report the death and simply hide the cash which is not addressed the plotting and characterization while sometimes predictable worked in way that kept my attention and on more than one occasion gave me chills will therefore attempt to continue this review in way that doesn give away too much of the plot broadly the trio are in danger due to hugo underworld connections as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process police inspector ken stott is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with junior detective david meanwhile becomes increasingly paranoid moves into the attic and develops an affinity for sharp objects director danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other while do not consider myself the happy endings are automatically stupid type thought that shallow grave really should have ended in tragedy realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison in the mental hospital or in the morgue this could have been accomplished quite credibly but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for more conventional caper ending in which we get kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom and nothing more granted this isn really happy ending but it still pretty light hearted compared to what preceded it really shouldn say anything more about the ending as far as details go but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable yes this ending made me crack smile for couple of minutes but ultimately it left me feeling as if been cheated still shallow grave was brilliant most of the way through and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller and am therefore awarding it three stars guess just can help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away
private matter is based on the true story of sherri finkbine and the events in her life during the 1960s after becoming pregnant for the fifth time she learns that some tranquilizers she had taken have seriously deformed her unborn child she and her husband decide with the help of her doctor to have an abortion but this is the 1960s and abortion is illegal her doctor has made arrangements to have the procedure performed withing the law by claiming that the child is endangering the mother life everything is about to work out just fine until sherri has the uncontrollable urge to talk about her situation with local reporter this sets off media frenzy and immediately sherri is the most hated woman in the world she and her husband are fired from their jobs reporters are surrounding their home at all times and most importantly no one in the country and eventually other countries will perform the abortion this causes emotion problems for all involved private matter is fascinating story and it hard to believe that this only happened 30 years or so ago it only flaw is that not once is there ever satisfactory confrontation with sherri and any of her opponents one woman passing her on the street telss her to burn in hell and when sherri appropriately yells back just tell me what supposed to do the woman has no answer no one apparently had an answer they just wanted to control what should have been only the choice of sherri and her husband this is an important film telling an important story it not just about not wanting another child it about not wanting child who will cause severe changes in their family none of which could be beneficial sydney pollack served as executive producer for this made for hbo movie
here word analogy amistad is to the lost world as schindler list is to jurassic park in 1993 after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit many critics described schindler list as the director penance as if there was need for him to apologize for making crowd pleasing blockbuster now after three year layoff spielberg is back with vengeance once again his summer release was special effects loaded action adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers now following his 1993 pattern he has fashioned another serious inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity that film is amistad although not as masterful as schindler list amistad is nevertheless gripping motion picture thematically rich impeccably crafted and intellectually stimulating the only area where this movie falls little short is in its emotional impact watching schindler list was powerful almost spiritual experience spielberg pulled us into the narrative absorbed us in the drama then finally let us go exhausted and shattered three plus hours later aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since amistad while fine example of film making is not as transcendent the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books but considering who writes the texts that not surprise however the event is part of the american social and legal fabric and while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account most of the basic facts are in order several mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film dramatic force on the whole while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired one stormy night during the summer of 1839 the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape led by the lion hearted cinque djimon hounsou they take control of the vessel killing most of the crew adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey they are tricked however and the la amistad which makes its way northward off the united states eastern coastline is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison charged with murder and piracy the first men to come to the africans defense are abolitionists theodore joadson morgan freeman and lewis tappan stellan skarsgard they are soon joined by roger baldwin matthew mcconaughey property attorney of little repute aided by advice from former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins baldwin proves more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for and his central argument that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men not property convinces the judge but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin cause current president martin van buren nigel hawthorne eager to please southern voters and 11 year old queen isabella of spain anna paquin begins pulling strings behind the scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free at its heart amistad is tale of human courage cinque is heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to he is free man not slave and while he recognizes that he may die as result of his struggle he will not give it up effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in battle of ideologies they are individuals and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie success to amplify this point spielberg presents many scenes from the africans point of view detailing their occasionally humorous observations about some of the beyaz man seemingly strange rituals the larger struggle is of course one of defining humanity as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as sub human so the pro slavery forces of amistad use similar defense the abolitionists regard the africans as men but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property in sense the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war which would break out less than three decades later looming over everything amistad presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history four claimants come forward against the africans the state which wants them tried for murder the queen of spain who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american spanish treaty two american naval officers who claim the right of high seas salvage and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad who demand that their property be returned to them baldwin must counter all of these claims while facing challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of relationship he develops with cinque even though attorney and client are divided by language barrier they gradually learn to communicate aside from cinque who is fully realized individual characterization is spotty but the acting is top notch matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his pretty boy image to become baldwin but the lawyer is never particularly well defined outside of his role in the la amistad case likewise while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan they are never anything more than abolitionists nigel hawthorne who played the title character in the madness of king george presents martin van buren as spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election finally there anthony hopkins whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done hopkins who can convincingly play such diverse figures as serial killer an emotionally crippled english butler and richard nixon makes us believe that he is adams his ten minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler list is this film lack of well defined human villain schindler list had ralph fiennes superbly realized amon goeth who was not only three dimensional character but personification of all that the nazis stood for there is no such figure in amistad the villain is slavery but an ideology no matter how evil is rarely the best adversary it is to spielberg credit that he has fashioned such compelling motion picture without prominent antagonist amistad trek to the screen which encountered some choppy waters author barbara chase riboud has cried plagiarism charge denied by the film makers comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident an opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29 1997 numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has but one thing is certain with spielberg rousing substantive film leading the way the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history
in flashback the teenage girl in the eccentric family in the canadian film the hanging garden tells her senile grandmother that she is going to school dance horrified the grandmother wants to know if her granddaughter knows the rule of if you don break off kiss by the count of then you committed sin with the boy and most of all the grandmother wants to know if she has protection she must carry rosary in her pocket at all times the richly acted film is written and directed by thom fitzgerald in quirky but loving style although some may refer to the film as yet another dysfunctional family picture that moniker misses the mark yes every member of the household has their own special problems but the writer didn choose to name so many characters for various flowers by accident this delightful little picture mixes love tragedy and pathos resulting in hopeful and almost magical concoction during the opening credits we observe the boy sweet william at the center of the story first he an average sized young lad who is slapped off screen by his father next he 300 pound teenager played with hopelessness and depression by troy veinotte when the opening credits end we cut to 10 years later william is now an average sized reasonably happy adult played with love and compassion by chris leavins william has returned after 10 years absence to attend the marriage of his free spirited and foul mouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover fletcher joe keller kerry fox from an angel at my table and shallow grave plays rosemary with compelling joy nicole burnell who gave such devastating performance in the sweet hereafter plays the teenage rosemary the father of the family whiskey mac peter macneill is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful his wife iris seana mckenna says that she would have left him years ago to at least go to some place warm were it not for her lack of money and her obligations to the kids rounding out the family is christine dunsworth as nine year old violet the sister whom william meets for the first time as the exuberant irish music fills the air at the wedding in the family home william wanders off to try on one of his old coats which causes him to laugh at the size of his former self the director manages to stage simple scenes in wonderfully imaginative ways he takes common wedding dress train and uses it to set up scenes in fresh and fascinating ways rosmary trip to the bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to cope with the long train in small bath all while talking to her brother as much as anything the film is series of character sketches in one of the strongest we watch william in flashback as he has his first sexual encounter homosexual one although he is perfectly happy liking the same sex his mother is aghast woman friend of hers suggests she take william to local housewife dusty miller martha irving who for fee will have heterosexual sex with william with absolute finesse the director crafts subtle scene that manages to yield significant emotional punch without being sensational dusty after asking iris to watch her daughter takes william and gently introduces him to the joys of sex with the opposite sex all of this notwithstanding he still prefers males the film is at its most poignant in several sequences in which the grown william comes face to face with himself when younger this causes his ugly old memories to be reignited in the most devastating he has to come to grips with his former self who was so overwhelmed with the stress that he tried to hang himself even here the director touches your heart without ever letting the story dissolve into anything approaching tearjerker the ultimate result is an uplifting story that has more hope that one would ever expect from the outline of its plot the hanging garden runs 31 it is rated for strong sexuality language violence and some teen drug use and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite old and mature
go is gloriously slick hip machine director liman who also photographed go and screenwriter august celebrate the drug rave scene in preferring to take comedic snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them after more than ninety minutes of pill popping tantric sex car chases and attempted murder go even has happy ending this is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches as go wound down anticipated an anti pill popping casual tantric sex car chase attempted murder sermon that blessedly didn arrive la tarantino pulp fiction go is comprised of three separate but related stories the basics are as follows ronna polley is bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough her co worker simon the improbably named askew is clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas zack mohr and adam wolf are soap opera stars escaping career threatening conviction by assisting peculiar cop fichtner in drug bust perhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino non linear masterwork is by now old hat the id fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me with the exception of that mind reading cat pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen but we see go wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last torontonian polley of the sweet hereafter refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was not pleased with her turn as the ill fated cashier in go she delivers hands down her best performance to date here an overrated actress who agreed to appear on the poster but not support her team at the junket or in interviews this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms polley as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you if she doesn want to be the ingenue of the moment she should have said no not go but digress go is fun film so chipperly depraved one can help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride in that sense it departure from liman last film swingers which at least lectured against self absorption in the form of vince vaughan trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story clever epilogue which has been aped by mcdonald for their latest commercial wish cared more about go characters like the techno music they listen to the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous when the lights came up and stung my eyes it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me yet entertain me it did go is light and frothy featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley timothy olyphant scream and especially fichtner whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs fichtner is character actor best known for playing backstabbers in heat armageddon and others his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go unlike much of the film fichtner is unpredictable
you ve probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over `keeping the faith it fluffy comedy thoroughly glazed with sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer regarding two moral topics love and religion and how romantic triangle causes the two to collide head on as youngsters brian finn jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio while their friendship progressed anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support so neither would feel excluded but tragedy soon struck as anna was forced to move away now adults brian edward norton and jacob ben stiller hold similar but contrastive jobs the likable and kind hearted father brian is catholic priest while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as jewish rabbi on the basketball court they refer to themselves as `the god squad in the relationship field brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy but jacob has reached the point where finding jewish bride is practically mandatory everything changes when anna jenna elfman returns to new york to visit her childhood chums now workaholic she devotes endless hours per week to her business but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again with these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail there bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult but `keeping the faith is open entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point to point edward norton has emerged as one of the finest most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the 1996 thriller `primal fear after shockingly bitter roles in `american history and most recently david fincher vicious `fight club quaint romantic comedy might seem like peculiar choice not in the least norton slips into the director chair for the first time with `keeping the faith and here his incisive resourceful approach helps add additional craft to surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg weighing every aspect it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut in addition norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian generating thoroughly likable screen presence stiller the zipper guy from `there something about mary is firm and funny boasting fully ripened comic maturity elfman perky repetition can grow tiresome such is occasionally the case on tv `dharma and greg but she seems perfectly rambunctious here the remaining cast members offer fine support from anne bancroft as jacob animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice `keeping the faith is the perfect date flick though perfection is not word to associate with the film in general there is turbulence during the process of lift off as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead once the film does settle in it is often funny and always cheerful stiller norton and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities we enjoy their interaction understand their various dilemmas and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true this is excluding the ending which is acceptable and all but seems to lack the charm and spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements nonetheless narrowly mishandled finale certainly won wipe the smile off your face nor anyone else in the audience `keeping the faith is highly enjoyable romantic comedy although one that is more observant while surveying the questions of love rather than religion aww what the hell the quality is not quite heaven sent but this little charmer could revive our `faith in potentially tired filmmaking genre
naturally at the core of leon gast when we were kings is the fight itself for what fight it was thanks to the business savvy of don king an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman fans were treated to an round battle of endurance and strategy as much as brute strength that immediately entered boxing lore with the benefit of the first hand recollections of that old ex pug norman mailer this classic conflict is brought back to life but when we were kings tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of boxing match questions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary gast could hardly choose otherwise considering the vocal uncompromising politics of muhammad ali member of the controversial siyah separatist movement the nation of islam ali opens gast film with forceful swipe at the united states when ali hollers damn america the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind his decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury no viet cong ever called me nigger ali reasons despite showcasing ali proud unequivocal politics one of the most impressive features of when we were kings is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of siyah unity and siyah symbolism that ali and his supporters champion listening to the film numerous commentators it is clear that the geographic location for this rumble in the jungle is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on map spike lee tells us that the event was pilgrimage coming home to africa foreman reminds us that africa is the cradle of civilisation fair enough but this homeland is specific nation cursed with less than inspiring reality it is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu brutal dictator while ali respects mobutu ability to forge an independent african state mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well stocked torture chambers mailer insights are lost on most of the film commentators george plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo rather than the newly christened zaire with admirable restraint gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire squalid ruling elite mobutu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism of siyah power don king resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease with the messiah label attributed to him by loyal disciple passes himself off as the voice of new siyah international solidarity understandably foreman believes he has gotten raw deal he may be as one sympathiser notes blacker than ali but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali the thuggish mobutu and the tacky huckster don king africa zaire inspirational leader or vicious dictator all is left undifferentiated unconsidered in this optimistic celebration of siyah unity little wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find that ali opponent wasn beyaz admittedly these issues are only hinted at rather than substantially explored the audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves in their own time there is just too much to cover too much that is truly worthy of celebration for protracted political analysis to be justified the excitement of james brown and king in concert for instance and of course there always ali to consider as he shamelessly and hilariously hams it up in front of the camera shadow boxing and uttering one inspired rhyme after another we gonna get it on coz we don get along doubtlessly considering the multi faceted nature of the extravaganza they chose to cover the makers of when we were kings faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues and what personalities best deserved their attention fortunately by refusing to simplify their complex subject matter they have captured the richness and excitement of this unique event
kolya is one of the richest films ve seen in some time zdenek sverak plays confirmed old bachelor who likely to remain so who finds his life as czech cellist increasingly impacted by the five year old boy that he taking care of though it ends rather abruptly and whining cause wanted to spend more time with these characters the acting writing and production values are as high as if not higher than comparable american dramas this father and son delight sverak also wrote the script while his son jan directed won golden globe for best foreign language film and couple days after saw it walked away an oscar in czech and russian with english subtitles
no it is not bad film in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose actually wished for the film to end itself quickly event horizon is not your run of the mill sci fi film sure many who have watched this will agree with me it is not even original in that sense and it does borrow heavily from films like alien hellraiser and even blade runner the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build up that makes it wonderfully horrifying the story brings us to the year 2050 where space travel have since enormously progressed the event horizon is actually ship built for secret experimental purpose it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in man lifetime the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after years it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune search and rescue team led by miller fishburne is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon the designer of the ship dr weir neill follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship event horizon is sci fi horror film much truer to the word than say alien would ever be while in alien the crew has to cope with ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces in event horizon the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb up till the point where really felt like saying out loud `enough can stand this anymore there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also the acting is only at most average by most commercial standards even so the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film thanks to its well paced storytelling disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences which incidentally has been quite generously removed by our censorship board =20 director paul anderson who did mortal kombat and his team of `atmosphere creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror this picture did not do very well in the us box office most probably for the dread factor impact it has on most audiences people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this although on the face of it event horizon is mostly molded for mass entertainment many thrills spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus however the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing my friend and could not say word to each other for quite while after going through the `experience of event horizon guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us be forewarned this film is not for the faint hearted nor for pure entertainment be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film event horizon is highly recommended=85=85but at your own risk it has been long time since good horror embraced the big screen and event horizon is one

note ordinarily moviereviews org will not give away any critical plot points of film that could be interpreted as spoilers however being that music of the heart is based on true story and that moviereviews org feels the film can not be properly credited without such revelations plot giveaways will appear in the following review if this bothers you please note the star rating of the film and stop reading now what does it take to play carnegie hall practice it takes two hours for music of the heart to play carnegie hall both figuratively and literally like the children it portrays the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to show stopping performance at the legendary concert hall roberta guaspari academy award winner meryl streep has two kids husband who left her and 50 violins she bought from small shop in the mediterranean her life desperately needs jump start and gets one when she meets man who introduces her to job as music teacher at an east harlem elementary school she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors that is the pattern like plot of this production ultimately the film chooses zero sum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an all time high when the men in her life finally vanish the first hour of music of the heart is rather painful roberta character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat also lacking depth is the film bad guy narrow minded music teacher josh pais who rejects roberta out of principle the movie never explains exactly which principle that is and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have villain around the next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre they are highlighted by one child return to roberta class coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be can be around anymore because my mom said and glowing concert not knowing the running time you may expect the credits to role at this point but they don instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent director wes craven known for his works of horror uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic but last night and roberta two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their father absence the city of harlem plays strong role in the movie roberta mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype the noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens predictably one of roberta students is gunned down and killed off screen one thing the film does lack is subtlety the fact that little boy was playing we shall overcome on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was cute and discreet reference the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience of course in horror films the foreshadowing and between the line moments are meant to be overdone so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game even with all its flaws music of the heart is beautiful film that is not an excuse for the movie poor beginning but as watched the scenes in carnegie hall thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage in december of 1979 comedian named andy kaufman put on show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history the performance included dead on elvis impression robin williams in disguise and moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies so how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life he had character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience perhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santa favorite food this movie has an amazing finale
upon taking seat at the theater and surveying the crowd soon realized that was the only person under forty in the premises twenty two but have been accused of looking sixteen yet as the film began any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close knit yet troubled sisters director pat connor inventing the abbots circle of friends weaves quiet yet affecting tale of loss need and the bonds between five sisters the family is ruled by kate meryl streep an unconsciously strict schoolteacher who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family there is very little background given to the viewer as we are thrust into tense but loving home squabbles take place one after the other caused by years and years of history perhaps one of the best things about this film is its naturalness no situation is over wrought and characters react as real people do to real problems this probably is result of the film being from stage play the play was in turn is based on time in the life of the playwright what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples both in lughnasa and africa in fact dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness legs tap and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster only after the music stops and the characters stand breathing heavily do we sense any trouble in the quiet after the music we muse that it sad that music has to cease and families falter the movie is framed by scene of michael mundy the narrator of the movie as young child flying kite he trips over bump and loses hold of his string and the kite floats off farther into the distance drawn on the beyaz diamond of the kite is face that looks at once pained and at another glance mischievous the mundy family itself follows similar fate to that of the kite and kate hold of the family isn strong enough to hold off the winds of change as michael stands staring at his kite fly away we hear the adult michael looking back at the season that his world changed forever the movie is not overpowering but it gives us beautiful window into the life love and trouble of household of lonely women note this is the first movie review ve ever written any responses on it would be greatly appreciated
in may of 1977 just years after steven spielberg success with jaws and years after francis coppolas the godfather risky ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success little did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film in january of this year lucas re released star wars on its 20th anniversary in this new remastered version the added effects which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of jam with computer generated jabba the hutt don do much but call attention to themselves other than these the film is exactly the same why pay to see it in the theaters you might ask simply because when this movie was released most of us were few years short of being born we should all get up and go to the movies for the experience especially if you haven seen it the plot is basic but in the same way complex it has many themes but the one rotates around luke skywalker mark hamill and his quest to become jedi knight his mission begins when droid named r2 d2 plays back secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia carrie fisher which tells him to contact the mysterious obi wan kanoby alec guiness he and kanoby then joined by two inter galactic renegades hans solo harrison ford and chewbacca and skywalker two droids d2 and c3po the voice of anthony edwards wage war upon the corrupt empire commanded by an evil general peter cushing and the traitorous darth vader the voice of james earl jones skywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger the force the film is obviously quite star studded but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones voice would appear so many more times in the future it just happened to work out for him the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker triumph is symbolized by the audience sense of becoming something larger than life itself universe of fans young and old recreating movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever
`strange days chronicles the last two days of 1999 in los angeles as the locals gear up for the new millenium lenny nero ralph fiennes goes about his business of peddling erotic memory clips he pines for his ex girlfriend faith juliette lewis not noticing that another friend mace angela bassett really cares for him this film features good performances impressive film making technique and breath taking crowd scenes director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it but as whole this is an unsatisfying movie the problem is that the writers james cameron and jay cocks were too ambitious aiming for film with social relevance thrills and drama not that ambitious film making should be discouraged just that when it fails to achieve its goals it fails badly and obviously the film just ends up preachy unexciting and uninvolving
plot young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes staple by his side but this new guy is not like all the others he got ambition he got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster violence lots of swearing and betrayals ensue critique very good serious minded unique british gangster flick which misses the great mark by way of an annoying voice over popping up throughout the film and so so ending here yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix okay so it not entirely new but it definitely original when all put together as done here the thing liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place it 1968 and these dudes are looking good yes it all about the suits fellas the italian shoes the cufflinks the ties and the birds that ladies for those uninitiated hanging around you here are bunch of horrible men gangsters if you will looking sharp talking shit and busting heads all over the place but that not the basis of this movie the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group the excellent david thewlis and one of his cronies paul bettany also extremely good in this film and how the power sex appeal and coolness of one affects the other you know how there are always these hanger on gangster types who latch on to the godfathers the leaders the top dogs of every crime organization well most of the time these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person that is their boss so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence but this film brings the betrayals the messed up loyalties the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package of course director paul mcguigan isn trying to be guy ritchie here and doesn over stylize his presentation jazz it all up with hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix nope he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as type this the first is confrontation sequence between bettany and man from which he attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty look into my eyes in fact the last time that ve seen guy so scared in movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers miller crossing scary shite but there an ever better scene than that in this film this one features bettany once again slowly torturing hacking and beating the living piss out of rival gangster from that man point of view but not before turning on quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes one by one that right he does the guy in his underwear that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman but the flick not perfect in fact didn mind malcolm mcdowell voice over narration at first but as the film grew into major flashback most of the film is presented as such he came in every now and then and rarely added anything of interest to the plot all he seemed to do was swear and call people the word umpteen times and even described one scene as it was happening so opened the door then went up the lift etc it like yeah know that already could see it on the screen overdone also didn quite buy the ending of the movie which despite being original seemed little unbelievable especially when you consider that it supposed to be taking place 30 years later and folks still seem to be holding grudges still in love still living in the same apartments mean mon it 30 years man don know somehow it didn work all that well for me but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies and this one is decent addition to the lot forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell narration of the obvious plot points and concentrate on the film stronger attributes such as its style the exquisite atmosphere of the time period its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads bettany and thewlis incidentally unlike few of the gangster flicks that mention below this one is in no way parody or homage to this genre of films it the real deal note this film is packed with strong accents all around which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time it also quite violent and don remember any film that used the word as much as this one so leave the kids at home for this one where joblo coming from american psycho 10 10 clockwork orange 10 donnie brasco 10 fight club 10 10 get carter 10 godfather 10 10 godfather ii 10 10 goodfellas 10 10 lock stock two

my filmcritic com colleague norm schrager nailed session brad anderson throwback to spooky horror films from the 70 it worked as an eerie homage without being self referential or smugly postmodern genre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to stanley kubrick the shining and george romero dawn of the dead without being taken out of the engrossing narrative psychologically addled waste management team clears out an abandoned lunatic asylum unspeakable dread ensues in double whammy for 2001 anderson shoots and mostly scores again with his eclectic riff on time travel episodes from the twilight zone appropriately titled happy accidents much like session the cards are played very close to the vest here is boyish eccentric sam deed from dubuque iowa futuristic voyager from the year 2470 or just your run of the mill psychologically disturbed nutcase let loose on the present day streets of nyc as played by wonderful character actor vincent onofrio full metal jacket it up in the air whether or not we should accept his detailed monologues about life after the polar ice caps have melted the question proves to be moot at least for time even if the whole thing proves to be creative delusion one agrees with the character judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend ruby marisa tomei he freak but he sure tells good story neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after series of nightmarish dating disasters the junkie the fetishist the artist the frenchman etc but isn quite sure how to handle sam deed when he starts explaining the barcode on his arm his elaborately constructed fake identity his pathological fear of dogs his ability to speak five different languages and his mission to change crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on time alternate realities don ask it all bit much to take in ruby close friend gretchen cuz ya can have love story without the token friend though nadia dajani invests the thankless role with warmth chalks it up as sexy role playing game but her cautious therapist holland taylor warns her that co dependency is rearing its ugly head again and she in over her head with yet another doomed relationship who ya gonna believe despite her winning an academy award marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents her brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear cute to her adoring fans being loud and flashing disingenuous smile does not necessarily equal substantial and sexy it takes more than crack team of hair and wardrobe people to imbue her with personality then there that damned voice which strains to be oh so adorable look this stuff is purely subjective some people feel this way about richard gere others cannot bear to watch robin williams hyperactive schtick for my money it tomei with bullet happy accidents is romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys or more appropriately chris marker la jetee especially with those still framed memory photographs anderson employs as stylistic device throughout modern manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly vaguely alien eye with color scheme oddly reminiscent of logan run as the stranger in strange land onofrio walks slightly out of step wonderfully affable but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions and bemused detachment this is science fiction told mainly via the power of suggestion though it often falls into the sci fi trap of having entirely too much forced exposition we want deeds not words at least twenty minutes too long happy accidents eventually gets around to race against time scenario that puts sam deed to the ultimate test no movie can live in ambiguity forever but anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives let pretend the loathsome and predictable next stop wonderland never happened shall we there are also some slow repetitive stretches as ruby and sam go over the same arguments again and again over whether or not he crazy the premise is strong enough to sustain interest but it enough to throw nod in the general direction of rod serling for wrapping up his ideas in half hour time slots commercials included
it is with hesitance that call apocalypse now masterpiece certainly it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made with director known for producing masterpieces with ease and some of the finest actors of the 1970 the plot an adaptation of joseph conrad heart of darkness was set in vietnam and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant coming on the heels of the end of the war apocalypse certainly has its moments some of which are the finest in film history the plot is fairly simple captain willard sheen is troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for 2nd tour of duty his mission is simple take boat up to cambodian territory and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz brando with extreme prejudice along the way willard runs into series of adventures including one with lt col kilgore duvall and strange encounter with playboy bunnies willard four person crew finally make it to kurtz compound where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as god among the natives willard experiences with kurtz take up the last half hour with confrontation and eventual ending the movie is visually breathtaking the battle scenes are exquisitely done and the score is brilliant setting murky mood of darkness that is first rate the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie the journey to kurtz camp is quite ride with psychosis setting in on almost every character the most interesting one is kilgore the lt col who cares more about the surf than about the mission it is at times revolting psychotic and incredible and it is one hell of movie the scenes are bold inventive and powerful and the acting is stunning especially be sheen duvall and fishburne the narration is exquisite as is the mystery of kurtz coppola sets about hallucinatory ride through vietnam kind of like saving private ryan on lsd the film is jarring in its implications and psychotic in its execution the problems come when the film slows down one of the major scenes in the film where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz is colossal mess the dialogue is confusing the lighting is atrocious and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound the film slows down to drag sheen seems forever captured by madman played by brando is lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received brando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes but is bathed in shadows the entire time making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic the scenes are poorly done the dialogue is muffled and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief sheen seems to adore this man but why the viewers are never told the entire journey is supposed to be prelude for stunning entrance of this god like kurtz but the scenes fall way short of expectations granted it has its moments which are brutally horrific but the general feeling is one of confusion brando mumbles his lines in incoherent stir and my feeling was that this could never be great man this could never be man who inspires hundreds to follow him so why do they do it there are moments of brilliance but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have satisfying ending the finest scene at the end is sheen escape and his entrace into the temple his rise out of the water with the smoke coming off of his slicked head is brilliant 30 seconds of film yet you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times and indeed the film on the whole is very good it is stunningly flawed expression of film for it addresses major issues such as man mental stamina during bouts of war but one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful had the character of kurtz been more explored and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for there is too much good material in here not to be called masterpiece but it could have been so much more rewarding

have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally at any given moment in life or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world or outside of it these thought provoking questions are the subject of final destination which is the most riveting horror drama since 1999 the sixth sense stylishly filmed and tautly directed by files alum james wong the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters in accurately written teen speak rather than overwrought highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn use all the while developing into darkly foreboding severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less successful but still suspenseful epilogue at the start of the film 17 year old high school senior alex browning devon sawa is about to leave with his 40 student french class for field trip to paris progressively getting case of preflight jitters he spots several mysterious coincidences including the departure time being 25 the same as his september 25 birthday as well as hearing the john denver song rocky mountain high over the sound system in the airport bathroom john denver died in plane crash alex grudgingly mutters to himself once seated alex suddenly gets horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff and after causing ruckus onboard he as well as six other students and teacher are thrown off arguing in the airport lobby alex suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight killing all 300+ passengers including the rest of their classmates as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode the fellow survivors whom he has saved treat him in varying manners carter kerr smith the hotshot jock holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate alex best friend tod chad donella wants to stand by him but can because of his fearful parents the teacher mrs lewton kristen cloke is frightened by him believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster as well as in state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to fellow coworker only outsider clear rivers ali larter who unboarded the plane due to sudden connection to alex premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life that is only the setup of final destination and the less said about what follows the better suffice to say the film does indeed turn into slasher film albeit one that is more thoughtful than most and replaces knife wielding maniac for the never seen granddaddy killer of them all the grim reaper itself the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes and final destination surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in rube goldbergesque manner they manage to occasionally be so intense you don know whether to shrink down in your seat tap your feet in nervousness or turn away devon sawa rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999 underseen slasher comedy idle hands is even more of charismatic presence here the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival which he comes to believe he wasn meant to do as well as the loss of the other passengers is superbly and subtly acted on his part one scene in which he is watching news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful ali larter 1999 varsity blues in the other central role is also effective as girl whose life was going well until her father died in convenience store shooting years before leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married loutish man the exact opposite of her now deceased father the other roles are not as fully written and most remain rather one dimensional the movie is mainly sawa however and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles tony todd 1992 candyman as an arcane morgue attendant pops up for five minute cameo but his appearance is rather supererogatory and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye while at other times it hovers over being just little too stilted and campy ultimately what is so good about final destination is that within the confines of the slasher genre writer director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created premise that has never been seen before in this manner and film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten two things that are rarely found in today horror films if anything it safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again
the word rest in the title should be stressed since this is movie that lacks any action scenes at all what does takes place is more based on character development the film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people nick beth carol and sid what they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at nick and beth have relationship and have decided to move from enfield arizona to butte montana and who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different carol is nick ex girlfriend and beth best friend sid is joint smoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in obviously based on stage play the problem with the movie is that there lot of things left out it not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other the reason why nick was fired from his job isn mentioned and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain mystery when he hasn seen them for many years set in small fictional town in arizona was good move since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings the name of the city is not important this could take place anywhere with four young people in house discussing life and the future particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her not an actress that have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with but ll keep an eye on her in the future interesting trivia this was rated in the us but rated barntill ten in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it
this is the movie not the perfume slow moving stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcock vertigo it is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader set in new orleans 1959 it shows the wealthy michael courtland cliff robertson sitting on top of the world celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary with party in his mansion as his lovely wife elizabeth genevi ve bujold and young daughter amy blackman both look up to him beaming with joy his real estate development partner bob la salle john lithgow proposes toast to him and to their prosperous business while his high society friends give him their best wishes upon retiring for the night his daughter and wife are kidnapped in their bedroom and he is left with ransom note to deliver $500 000 tomorrow or they will be killed inspector brie stanley reyes comes up with plan to put in phony money and transmitter in the briefcase exchange as that will lead them to the kidnappers but the kidnappers burst out of the house surrounded by the police taking the two victims with them and in the pursuing police chase the kidnapper car explodes and goes over the bridge where none of the bodies were found grieving the loss of his wife and child the guilt ridden michael builds them tomb on the expensive land they were to develop sixteen years later he goes with his partner bob on vacation and he revisits florence italy where he met his wife when he goes to the church where they met he sees young girl who looks exactly like his wife her name is sandra portinari genevi ve bujold and she working there restoring art that is decaying he falls instantly in love with her and doesn heed bob warnings that she might be altin digger and decides to take her back to new orleans and marry her sandra becomes his second chance to prove his love as he thinks he can finally put the past behind him the surprises to come weren really all that surprising as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ve bujold and the competent acting of john lithgow it plays too much like rehash of the master work to break any new ground yet it is still thrilling in its own way
bill condon gods and monsters is fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ian mckellan who made the horror classics frankenstein and bride of frankenstein since was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film there is no way to know how accurate the film is but suspect that much of it only came from whale inner fantasies and hallucinations whale who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once homosexual scandal broke out involving him as the film tells it during the end of his life whale at his large home in became infatuated with the tall handsome and much younger man clayton boone brendan fraser who was working as the gardener at his home james whale we learn quickly was what many people refer to him as in the film dirty old man in one of the opening scenes young film enthusiast visits whale home to interview him and whale agrees on one condition for every question he answers the young man must take off an article of clothing because of this episode we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for painting later making the excuse that his bright beyaz shirt is disracting only so he will take it off clayon agrees and doesn really think much of this much to the warnings of his friends becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past certainly the relationship between whale and boone is headed for downfall since whale starts to grow deep love for this young man even though boone is not gay and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis gods and monsters is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast due to his sexual preference and never got the recognition he would have liked since he longed to be referred to as motion picture director rather than horror director and in one heartbreaking scene he attends party with boone being his guest held by director george cuckor and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore it is evident that whale first love in his life was making movies and when his career ultimately fell apart so did his passion in life as played brilliantly by ian mckellen james whale comes off as sad but dignified man and person who was not afraid to stand out from others just as long as he knew he was being true to himself he never hid the fact that he was gay however even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession and it was this unblinking honesty that made him great person through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone boone of course only things of whale as possible friend or someone he can talk to while it means so much more to whale who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life although boone is only in dead end job as gardener of people homes whale views him as the ideal man not only one that is good looking even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings but one that will actually listen to him since whale lives with only his loyal but disapproving maid touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor although an extremely fine and mature picture few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments but it is little thin and the structuring of the on again off again friendship at the film center is fairly predictable we know early on where these two characters are headed and we can guess that there will be final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds in lesser hands this set up might have felt too calculated but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this also subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and waitress working at bar effectively played by lolita davidovich but abruptly dropped and never brought up again if the film was not going to follow up on this side story then it perhaps should have been taken out altogether gods and monsters is heartfelt and intelligent motion picture impressively directed by bill condon who sense relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone the film also plays as tribute to fine man who met an untimely end walking away from gods and monsters it was ian mckellen marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me and doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably it is sad testament when person true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life which ironically enough is no one else business in the first place
actually am fan of the original 1961 or so live action disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as pair of twins separated at birth by divorcing parents never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again and everyone should know how feel about remakes especially of films happen to enjoy my fallacy unless you re going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both just wrack your brain and come up with gasp new idea this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list and was actually quite the opposite contemporary live action disney films are not one of my favorties anyway they re usually unfunny alienating and big fat bore at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 this one however is shockingly not bad in fact it actually good not the original good but what great about it is that it doesn necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining because it cute and innocent fun because it has pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with because the lead star is immensely appealing because the parents are also immensely appealing and repeating myself because it cute and innocent fun there nothing too risque about it save the plot the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish but that is precisely the point of the movie and it aimed directly at either kids adults who want to remember the original or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be kid personally am somewhere between the second and third can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn so weird or diverse the names godard and kubrick weren even glimmer in my right eye back then when would tune in every sunday night for couple years to see abc wonderful world of disney where they show you live action and or made for tv disney flick an hour per week can remember my mom taking my sister and along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films like lady and the tramp and pinnochio and most sadly remember every single christmas without fail there were barage of children animated half hour shows made exclusively for the christmas season that wouldn dare missing can even remember seeing the made for tv parent trap ii on tv one night and after had seen that one over and over and over again saw the original parent trap it more of late childhood movie because it deals with the issue of divorce but it deals with it in disney ized version it playful and witty and charming and if saw it for the first time right now having never experienced that part of my childhood probably dismiss it probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if hadn seen the original at such perfect age watching it could remember what fun it was to watch disney film and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly perfect parents splitting up and how it affected my adolescence and also how it brushed that fear off with smooth stroke and pointed out that even in the most fucked up of situations things could always work out if you well manipulate things bit at least for the better this new version did that for me but it also charming in its own way it has new cast contemporary feel and for the first time in awhile for live action disney flick tone that isn corny or condescending but just right the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in safe kind of way and for the first time since the original film the kids actually know better than the foolish adults the story is basically classic by now repeated almost as many times as kurosawa the seven samurai pair of twins played here by lindsay lohan just like they were played by hayley mills in the original are separated at birth by their divorcing parents one annie is sent to live with the mother natasha richardson resembling her mother vanessa redgrave more than had ever noticed in london where she lives with her parents and her devoted foppish butler simon kunz as she works as swingin fashion designer she grows up refined and classy but also with keen knowledge in sports and poker playing the other hallie is sent to northern california with her father dennis quaid to live on vineyard with their pseudo maid lisa ann walter and grows up rugged yet charming they both meet at the same camp one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged they feud because they look all too similar and are thus in tight competition which results in some nasty pranks which winds them in seclusion together in private out of the way cabin there they become friends then learn about eachother once they know everything they concoct scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent whom they ve only heard of they learn about eachother lives in detail they make sure they look alike which requires hair cutting and notoriously ear piercing scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in pulp fiction and when the end of summer comes they switch and hope for the best lindsay lohan doesn necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original but she comes off just as appealing as she did once she does though add couple new things she makes the california twin little more appealing and the london twin bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original respectively she also adds on an american and british accent to each one with one faking the other accent throughout and if you really take notice you can see that the fake ones accents aren exactly perfect she also incredibly appealing not merely cute which is especially notable since this is her first feature film and we know how notorious child actors are especially in their first films she makes great protagonist and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing dennis quaid in fact hasn been this likable in about decade his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him notable actor in the past not just that he mr meg ryan ditto natasha richardson except that she just hasn ever been this likable period the two make winning couple maybe not so winning as maureen hara and the late brian keith in the original but they still work for this film instead of the bickering that ensued in the original the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original during the opening credits we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother and when back together again the film more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental but in that great way not the migraine inducing way as in many such films this all brings this new parent trap to level of entertainment that hasn really existed since well the original film years ago still my money the best live action disney flick of all time this is because it has form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot gold digging sharon stone type played by elaine hendrix who deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film treat instead of bore like the original this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be case in point it takes two starring the olsen twins because it treats the children as the smart ones and the adults as the silly ones not the other way around and because above everything it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew however in comparison with the original it could be bit better certain scenes work well but not nearly as well as they worked in the original liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than liked watching two old flames getting back together over bottle of wine somehow feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing lesson extracted from the howard hawks cary grant films of yesteryear and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom compared to the original this film almost drowns in cutedom the original though not gritty was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences as such this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances

synopsis as response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be test case if she can survive the demanding training she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps throw in lot of political machinations sabotage brutality water and sand and you have an entertaining movie review the title of this movie turned me off at first mean gi jane the other titles which were considered were more promising in pursuit of honor or matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are little meaningless as far as concerned went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor to my surprise really enjoyed the movie moore as lieutenant jordan neil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for gusty woman in few good men the storyline is simple anne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is ruthless machiavellian politician with an agenda to push using feminism to achieve political mileage she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit test case to enter the highly intensive navy training jordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all looks brains and strength the training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch nonetheless it one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless hero heroine along in his her endeavours sure there are the stereotypical elements inhuman treatment sexual innuendo resentful peers pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer stepping away from the stereotypes though viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than brutal screamer his character exercises little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such character jordan boyfriend royce is also in the military although they both started at the same time due to the fact that he has seen active service he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has royce what is his surname do we care almost resents jordan attempts to advance herself although he quickly settles down to being doe eyed and supportive his character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you don have to be lesbian to want to be in the military in parts this is very silly movie with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that it hard not to cringe still liked it though weaknesses in the script aside this is film which captures heroic and reckless mood as we watch jordan battle it increasingly clear that it is personal battle this is an individual fight for self advancement we don have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings we don have to feel uncomfortable because we re having ideology thrust down our throats it enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or not
if you thought baz luhrmann radical take on _william_shakespeare s_romeo_+_juliet_ was wild wait until what you see what tony award winning stage director julie taymor _the_lion_king _the_broadway_musical_ does to the bard _titus_andronicus_ for her audacious and very bloody film debut while luhrmann transplanted the star crossed lovers to 1990s florida taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in rome but places it in surreal temporal limbo the colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the 1990s while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more 40s and 50s and other garments are more gladiator like as tamora queen of goths jessica lange exacts revenge on roman general titus anthony hopkins for killing her eldest son and he does the same to her for the wrongs she commits taymor obviously wanted to express the timeless relevance of the story underlying themes however the time convergence approach only works at times for often it just distracting as in one scene where tamora suviving sons matthew rhys and jonathan rhys meyers blow off steam playing video arcade games taymor didn have to resort to such avant garde time tricks for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned them she is strong storyteller and master visual stylist the latter compliment encompassing all areas makeup and costume choices as well as those in the editing and photography departments she also has sure way with actors hopkins titus is at once tragic and horrifying and lange is sultry as the viperous tamora the clear standout of the cast however is harry lennix as aaron moor who is tamora secret lover and schemer in his own right lennix brings great depth to role that could have easily been played as stock villain great villain he indeed is but to leave it at that isn giving full justice to his powerful and multi dimensional work _titus_ isn complete success but it is never less than fascinating and it announces the arrival of fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice
is it just me or have disney films gradually lost their appeal was almost stunned by the quality of who framed roger rabbit fun unique look at world where cartoons and people lived together the little mermaid harkened back to and perhaps surpassed the classic disney animations from the first half of the century however the endless stream of the little mermaid wanna be is getting to me you know the spiel lame plot recycled from some well known story colorful almost psychedelic animation the lead character who learns valuable moral lesson the comedic sidekick sidekicks the seemingly unattainable love interest few catchy songs few in jokes for adults and the occasional out of place warner brothers coyote fall off the cliff type joke it formula and like any formula it gets tiresome that why delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli japanese cartoon studio from what ve seen of their movies kiki delivery service and the already english dubbed and american distributed my neighbor totoro foreign audiences are in for treat these movies particularly kiki delivery service are wonderfully original and entertaining kiki delivery service starts with an unusual premise kiki upon hearing forecasts of clear skies decides it is time for her to leave home this is unusual because kiki isn college student or young adult making her start on the world but thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as witch her mother is also witch and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance just the idea of witch heroine may scare away some audiences but no mention is made of the occult and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie kiki mother acts as village doctor and kiki is able to do no more than fly on broom kiki must choose city to move to and what she chooses is the co star of the movie german seaport town far removed from the country life she has been used to initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding she discouraged and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as witch on the verge of leaving for new town she uses her power of flight to deliver pacifier to baby who dropped it the favor eventually blossoms into her working as courier one persons delivery service this is where the movie becomes shockingly good kiki job is catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn seem forced or artificial but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in different light they re three dimensional impossible to quickly evaluate possessing of faults and understandably reserving in kindness towards strange girl however each one has something about them some interest or trait that makes them interesting and unique the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings the seaport town genuinely looks impressive capturing the european charm of medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950 this beauty is beauty with depth for every detail left in dozens are only hinted at could probably go on all day but won suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie some of my favorites are kiki relationship with the baker husband although he quiet never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie and he initially scares her his kindness wins her friendship in the garage of deliveree house can be found vintage model two old ladies have relationship evolving from master servant to friend friend such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg added on top of this is lesson on the importance of self worth kiki initially seems to derive much of her self worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her but an encounter with rude girl crashes down her bewonderment making her question the importance of such beauty this causes kiki to lose faith in herself however kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings but the innate beauty inside her seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that don even want to hint at it the ending of the movie has subtle charm combined with sense of awe and ironically the most disney esque moment ve ever seen if you don hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions there is no violence however cartoonish no song and dance number and kiki pet cat jiji is more friend than comedic sidekick although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes however would be surprised if disney doesn give jiji more jokes or at least the voice of some comedian refreshingly enough the moral lesson of the movie is not self contradicted habit disney movies have gotten into beauty and the beast beautiful belle for instance learned that beauty was derived from person inside and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into handsome prince in snazzy clothing kiki on the other hand learns to separate her wardrobe from her self image and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film another difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for kiki delivery service not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be but with greater attention to realism and detail it fits the movie to this is particularly true with scenes of kiki flights the extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film ve ever seen not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states disney tentatively plans theater release of monoko hime shortly following the summer 97 japanese release and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release although the wait is unfortunate it good to know that it being released at all for kiki delivery service is definitely movie worthy of widespread promotion and release watch this movie along with man bites dog and perhaps something by woody allen this is the best movie ve ever seen
allen star of many brian depalma movie in the early eighties has brief throwaway part towards the end of out of sight as the maid of crooked financier in keeping with her past performances allen wears little more than green velvet victoria secret ensemble which begs the question did they really need costume designer for this out of sight is not likely to secure ms allen the kind of plaudits bestowed upon pam grier who likewise returned from out of obscurity to appear in another recent elmore leonard adaptation jackie brown but it is intriguing to see her name kicking off the also starring credits given her limited screen time the real stars of out of sight are george clooney batman robin by way of and jennifer lopez selena whose winning chemistry coupled with steven soderbergh freeze frame directorial technique help the film retain the charismatic charm of leonard original work with the success of get shorty three years ago filmmakers have realized that adapting an elmore leonard novel can be an easier proposition than trying to dream up storyline from scratch in out of sight clooney stars as jack foley career criminal who specializes in unarmed robbery he just waltzes into banks and politely makes withdrawal claiming that his partner just another customer it so happens will shoot the manager if the teller doesn comply for all of jack nice guy charm though he not very lucky his latest scam lands him in florida glades correctional facility federal marshal karen sisco lopez coincidentally arrives at the prison just as jack and his buddy ving rhames typically appealing are breaking out there brief struggle and jack bundles himself and karen into the trunk of the getaway car it in these cramped confines pressed intimately together that jack and karen start falling for one another the mutual attraction continues as the couple on opposite sides of the law slip in and out of one another grasp karen follows jack to detroit where he about to pull off another heist this time cache of uncut diamonds from incarcerated businessman richard ripley played by toupee sporting albert brooks almost unrecognizable in the prison scenes it during this final caper gone awry that allen makes her scant appearance clooney range as an actor is limited but he has undeniable charm lopez too is easy on the eyes but she demonstrates more depth in her portrayal of karen tough yet tender professional she dispenses with hit men as easily as she out maneuvers sleazy pick up artists in bar especially cute is sequence in which karen fantasizes about jack in motel bathtub admirably supporting clooney and lopez are don cheadle as fellow felon maurice snoopy miller steve zahn as the perennially stoned glenn michaels and dennis farina as karen dad who affectionately buys her piece add couple of uncredited cameos from jackie brown cast members and out of sight proves to be lot of fun not as hip and clever as shorty perhaps or as complex and colorful as brown but loads of fun nonetheless
like movies with albert brooks and really like movies directed and written by albert brooks lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies his humor is of kind that is not very prevalent in movies today inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent talk films which are finding their way into theaters the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with but even if we can brooks has the talent to make them comfortable and therefore we laugh teenagers and jim carrey fans probably won find an albert brooks movie very funny but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will put simply brooks comedy is intelligent mother is albert brooks latest film and it does not disappoint brooks plays john henderson middle aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce he makes an attempt at dating but fails miserably he then has dinner with his brother jeff rob morrow successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life jeff has good job loving family and most of all warm relationship with their mother beatrice debbie reynolds after dinner john witnesses telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky dory the dialog is in comparison beatrice always hints at fault in john and his career every time she talks with him and john gives it right back to her at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john life she says love you and john replies with know you think you do the thing is beatrice is not overt with her criticisms but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit picking and guilt loading it the kind that goes something like yes dear think you do that wonderfully but it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy there always the big but john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women either because of his flawed self esteem caused by his need for validation or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home he should move back in with his mother for while just to see what kinds of feelings come out and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is great experiment he calls it brooks own brand of humor really shines in this film especially in the interaction john has with his mother there scene where john has just arrived at his mother house and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito and having explained to his mother about the great experiment beatrice asks now explain to me again why you don want to stay at hotel she still doesn get it and it is absolutely hilarious in the same scene we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over when john points out the ice on the sherbet beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze you ve named the ice asks john he also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator such as twenty pound block of cheese the freezer was good invention says john but it not supposed to be used for everything that why it smaller than the refrigerator it something most of us find strangely familiar brooks is also master at employing the non sequitur for example in defending your life his and meryl streep characters are in comedy club having discussion when they re finished and walk out brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line and so the moral is if you have to fart go outside you don know what the joke was because you couldn hear him during the entire scene but must have laughed for the next five minutes it seemed so out of context in this film brooks uses the same trick couple of times to open or close scene don want to give them away but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past john purpose for staying with his mother is to learn and we as the audience learn right along with him his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with but as john spends more time with her we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way on screen brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world in way he very much like yosarian of catch 22 expect with something of an attitude casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect she assumes the part with ease even moving and speaking little slowly and is just so adorable it hard to get mad at her character this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her as his first choice brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer disease that may be just as well since reynolds lends softness to the character which enhances it immensely rob morrow also does good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother favorite and for all his success in his job and family is slowly exposed as mama boy the only things that hold this movie back from being better are couple of plot holes solid connection is not really made between john troubles and his reasons for living with his mother additionally the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this beatrice you must think some kind of moron john no think your someone who thinks moron beatrice well it takes one to know one

wish could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials but there isn george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant special effects bound flicks and he has done it again this is the first star wars film ve seen on the big screen so of course the impact was much greater than when watched the three original episodes on video what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story but its amazing visuals basically the film plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets qui gon liam neeson and his young apprentice obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor set out with the animated jar jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war when their ship breaks down and they are stranded they find young boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his slave mother qui gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing anakin participates in heart pounding podrace one of the highlights of the film to get the equipment needed to fix qui gon ship however most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy meanwhile queen amadala natalie portman is frustrated and at wit end being na ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of crumb this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made in all the star wars films human emotions that we the audience can identify with are usually nil but the films are for pure enjoyment not for uplifting purposes despite the fun of watching the movie the phantom menace is not without flaws for starters we have the ill conceived moronic character jar jar binks who should be considered threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience what klutz george lucas clumsily tried to create fun character that would be as memorable as say yoda r2 d2 or c3 po but alas his efforts were in vain secondly this may be good or bad depending on your point of view the movie atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic book feel of the previous three star wars installments this is due perhaps to the utter complexity to this movie plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions can say much about the acting though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway however there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances they are straightforward and at times stale natalie portman has great presence but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen stoic unfeeling enigma there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk despite the inevitable faults there is so much to enjoy about the movie the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes but they are amazing and edge of your seat fun in their own rite the film is treasure to look at the visual effects are astonishing 99 8% of the time the awe inspiring mouth opening eye popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius not since 1997 the fifth element has there been film as drenched in visual treats as this one the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element the previous star wars movies kubrick 2001 maybe even of fritz lang classic silent metropolis however all the sets are so original the original star wars movies can even match the grandeur of this film visuals and that is sheer pleasure for the viewer it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode the costumes are remarkable and have jean paul gaultier written all over them whether its queen amadala gigantic wardrobe complete with gold embroidery and feathers or the jedis simple brown uniforms the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie as for john williams score don think he done one as complex or powerful since can even remember it is as epic as his schindler list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films but williams has added on made the music much more intense and moving what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed there is very little to hate in the film it very accomplished and skillfully made flick it is the best fun film and the best big budget film out today most definitely
