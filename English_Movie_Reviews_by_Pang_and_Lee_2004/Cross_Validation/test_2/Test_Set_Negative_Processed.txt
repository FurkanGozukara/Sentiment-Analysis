the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film end if you re not familiar with this law then maybe you ve seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film end now if you re regular reader of mine you ve heard me say this countless times you know how drive me crazy is going to end but is the journey to get to that ending worth it no it definitely is not melissa joan hart from abc sabrina the teenage witch likes hunky stud on the basketball team adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who just broken up with his activist girlfriend apparently he wants to make his ex girlfriend jealous enough to take him back and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance so the two pretend to date for some reason but only after hart gives grenier bath to turn him into hunky stud will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends will this crazy scheme work do care the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy what makes movies like can hardly wait and 10 things hate about you work and to lesser extent she all that and never been kissed is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is joke and write their scripts accordingly don know what the writer intention was with drive me crazy there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to here there nothing just teens whining about who going to take them to the big dance do me favor kids go get job or something just shut the hell up in all honesty the best part of this film is the end credits now normally when say that it followed with the joke because the movie is finally over in this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film after the obligatory second playing of britney spears titular song there quick commercial jingle for burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and brief rendition of the school song for their high school nothing great but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them sci fi fans take note there are brief appearances from stephen collins star trek the motion picture and faye grant the tv miniseries and the final battle [pg 13]
follow up to disney live action 101 dalmatians that better more entertaining than the first just as unlikely with 102 dalmatians the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs more is definitely not the merrier 1996 101 dalmatians certainly wasn the greatest movie going experience of all time but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous larger than life performance in addition we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen and close facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53 year old actress under that startling siyah and beyaz wig of hers but that only half the problem with kevin lima laborious film what makes 102 dalmatians such collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor here almost single handedly foisted on wisecracking macaw who thinks he dog voiced by eric idle its rabid plotlessness cruella goes after puppies again winds up in goo again and most of all the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic heroes of the piece welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander than bland alice evans as parole officer named chlo gruffudd is cute and harmless perhaps but evans can even aspire to that the dogs upstage them both of course but in the case of evans even close split ends are more animated bad acting however seems to be requirement for this sequel since rard depardieu shows up as french furrier with haircut like robert de niro in men of honor jean pierre le pelt is flamboyant fashion designer with penchant for fine furs and depardieu over the top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail and wail for wail france most popular export besides brie has long since turned into caricature of himself and in 102 dalmatians the producers milk that realization for all it worth le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as poopies par example and ad nauseum the finesses of the script attributed to four screenwriters no less and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up are quickly dispensed with since all it takes for paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben that done it back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off limits sables and minks and plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of hooded designer gown the dogs are pretty cute try making puppy look otherwise but that pretty much all they are there always the feeling that there trainer off in the wings coaxing the dogs to open doors or pick up their food bowls in unison or pop tape into the videocasette recorder savvy holiday goers should skip 102 dalmatians and pop the original 1961 animated classic into their vcrs instead it one dalmatian less but 101% more satisfying
out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey cold uninvolving confusing new thriller though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard author of out of sight as well as jackie brown get shorty and pulp fiction after you watch it you realize that it not nearly good enough in an aggressively non linear fashion the limey li mey noun an english gentleman tells the story of wilson terrence stamp british ex con just released from year stint in prison for armed robbery he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny he doesn know much about the circumstances of her demise all he has is name terry valentine valentine was jenny former boyfriend wealthy and corrupt record executive he played by peter fonda in his first major role since the terrific ulee altin in 1997 seeking valentine reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having big party he winds up breaking his cover eventually setting off valentine head of security and valentine himself who decides to run for it what mess have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time pulp fiction which twisted time every which way was masterpiece but do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer the limey does exactly that the plot is permeated with flashbacks flash forwards and what can only be described as random time travel without any evident purpose there is no method to this movie madness it uses fancy way to tell story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably the plot isn particularly interesting in the first place traditional mildly hackneyed and not very involving this is sort of brooding film our protagonist doesn speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude felt like the director wasn very interested in the proceedings himself almost like he made this film for paycheck ditto for the editing which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal he not much in the way of stature but he has surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor he shy quiet but always effective he adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression his feelings don always show on his face by you can always tell what they are this is basically conventional thriller told in pretentiously bizarre fashion why soderbergh couldn just parrot down and tell story don know but what he does do certainly doesn work the result is wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil even the action scenes don work 1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one act two act three storyline but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it shall we go back to basics

the first film produced by adam sandler happy madison production company clever title eh is essentially one joke movie much like the movies sandler stars in himself however the difference here is that this one joke just isn very funny rob schneider stars as the title character scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming man whore to raise enough money to replace wealthy client custom made fish tank which deuce destroyed while staying in his home deuce goes on numerous dates and each woman he goes out with has humorous quirk about herself one has narcolepsy one has tourette syndrome one is man etc etc my problem is that we see all of these women in the film trailer so why do need to watch the movie seen the trailer seen the film only quick cameo from norm macdonald and follow up joke during the closing credits generates any chuckles deuce bigalow male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video division of di$ney the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 85 and features the original theatrical trailer as well as trailers for mystery alaska happy texas and outside providence an extremely brief production featurette which contains footage not used in the film and storyboard to scene comparisons yep you read that right there are storyboard comparisons on this dvd two scenes are storyboarded neither of which are particularly exciting there are fight scenes in this movie so why aren we seeing storyboards of those segments especially the parody moments from the matrix wonder what funnier the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that di$ney thought fans of this film would want to see them deleted scenes sure audio commentary you betcha but storyboards come on [r]
warning spoilers are included in this review but it doesn really make much of difference deep impact begins the official summer movie season and it also brings back memories of 1997 remember when dante peak came out in february few months later volcano was released the first film was smart exhilirating and one of the best disaster films had ever seen the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent well it deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition this time unfortunately the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon the upcoming comet disaster to be released the beginning of july of course the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine and so am in the minority as was when stood on the side of dante peak but while watching deep impact began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film apparently many did and it utterly baffles me to be completely honest haven had this little fun watching disaster film in my entire life volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo but it was still rather fun to watch deep impact doesn just have implausibilities it also contains cheap human drama incredibly horrible special effects and poorly constructed plot the only thing that gives it half star above my bottom ranking is slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters deep impact begins in an unnamed year the year varies advanced technology sets it in the future but fire in the sky is showing on local movie theater pushing it back to 1993 line of students is outside at night peering through telescopes at the dark sky above among these are leo biederman elijah wood and sarah hotchner leelee sobieski leo unknowingly discovers comet and his teacher sends photo of the unknown object to an astronomer who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about few seconds he races off to mail the information but is killed in reckless car accident year passes and nothing is heard about it again we are then introduced to jenny lerner leoni reporter for msnbc she gets handed job to investigate possible cover up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse james cromwell she talks to woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with girl named ellie after talking with rittenhouse and unsatisfied with the information she gets she decides to use the internet for help luckily she knows exactly how to spell the certain ellie that she is looking for they spell it ele in the film that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled before she can use the information the government decides to push her car off the road they take her in to meet the president of the united states president beck morgan freeman beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold press conference naturally she wants to be compensated and they offer her front row seat and the chance for the first question and so yada yada yada they reveal the comet to the public and their plans send massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive they announce plan called ark which is their only hope for survival computer will select 800 000 people at random these people are the ones who will go into large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won kill off the entire human race after two years the dust will settle actually it would take much much longer approximately ninety years from what understand and the humans could come back to the surface and start over the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures but there is one subplot worth mentioning jenny and her father jason maximilian schell have very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional it shame that nothing else is heartfelt now of course we all know that the comet does impact the surface the title alone suggests it and the previews actually show it by doing this absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won work director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show er her major film debut was the peacemaker pathetic and heartless action film well this time leder outdid herself creating film worse than that one suggestion to ms leder please stay away from the big screen or at least the action genre much of the blame can be placed on leder directly because the pace is disastrously off throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed it goes from months to weeks to hours it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real time it that boring of course leder isn all to blame for it screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted simplistic story that only gets worse with time what starts out promising soon turns deadly for the audience anyway chock full of cheesy one liners you know you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school and stupid characters you might think we were back in the 70s again only one of the subplots is remotely interesting while the rest are forgettable and boring and the main plot is so outrageous that you can figure out if this film is supposed to be an action drama or sci fi to put it simply the special effects of this film are hit and miss situation that right 80% miss and 20% hit scenes above the earth are well done and the orbiting ship is majestic but the comet is huge mistake making it more laughable than frightening the concept of even trying to land on comet is preposterous enough but that forgiveable what isn forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface give me break will ya and of course the much hyped collision of comet and earth well it is far from spectacular and it makes independence day look brilliant the water rushing towards the land is effective but once it hits the continent the effects turn ridiculous cgi water is used and it looks so bad that heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks in fact may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days just when we think visual effects can be improved along comes film to show that they really can and should be one thing has struck wrong note with me concerning mimi leder direction which also influences the actors leder loves to show the actors faces before and during moments of terror this reminded me of another action director renny harlin die hard cliffhanger but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations leder likes to flaunt people fears via their faces but instead of coming off as sympathetic leder seems more of sadist one moment has an astronaut flying off into space this should be enough to warrant response from the audience but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person face while drifting into space this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience and for one am not going to be fooled on another note leder film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts the pace does pick up and some very emotional moments are shown then again when you watch people cry for their loved ones it obvious it will be emotional it mostly just big trick to rope viewers into feeling for the characters but it didn work for me but anyway the actors do as much as they can with what they are given leoni bad boys tv the naked truth is the best of the film and she is given the meatiest role her character is made stronger by leoni presence and we grow to care for her robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch but his character is turned into shreds by the plot elijah wood also comes off rather successfully but he still hasn had many good roles wood stick to drama you are too talented for this stuff vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen maximilian schell is distracting but he does provide some nice humor morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this and gives one of his most shallow performances to date which is quite remarkable for him leelee sobieski could have been better but think she just suffered from poorly written character special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby eldard is good in his role but is limited by the plot crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv star trek the next generation seeing her was one of the highlights of the film overall very talented cast virtually wasted deep impact is rated pg 13 for disaster related elements and brief language this is one of the worst films of the year and if it is any omen of things to come this summer could be one of the worst ever luckily the files movie is coming up and hopefully armageddon will be more successful it shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn worth much costing nearly $75 million with special effects done by the illustrious ilm which is huge shocker and with score composed by oscar winner james horner titanic one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience well it not when the comet does hit the earth you almost wish it could just take this film along with it
practical magic is film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap trap like this one the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens two sisters whose family comes from long line of witches spanning back 200 years at the start their parents die when they are still children and they go to live with their two zany aunts stockard channing and dianne wiest switch to the present day gillian who is the stronger more rebellious sibling leaves home and meets up with dark abusive guy goran visjnic while sally stays in their hometown meets and falls in love with sweet caring man has two children and then is devastated when her husband is hit by truck and killed come to think of it she not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic they accidentally murder him and in desperation bury the body in the backyard of their aunts house add to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism not to mention spattering of light hearted whimsy and you have pretty good idea how messy practical magic is after seeing the film reflected that there was not even one scene or element that liked or enjoyed it is comedy to be sure but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching it is not charming or entertaining in any way and then to top it off we ve got this dark but bird brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian body whatever the characters are handled terribly and actually most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call character there is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film and in every scene involving them they are always standing side by side no attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people the same goes for aidan quinn as handsome police investigator who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock even though he comes into it at around the 70 minute mark and once again there is no attempt to develop their relationship or his character in any way in fact every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along rather than getting to know the people saying the lines should have know was headed for trouble during the opening credits when found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman who managed to destroy the batman series with batman forever and batman and robin practical magic is directed by griffin dunne primarily an actor who last year made the contrived clumsy romance addicted to love with meg ryan and matthew broderick disliked that movie quite bit but since practical magic is even worse that can only give you taste of what talentless filmmaker he is tell him to quit while he ahead but in these last two years he ultimately already buried himself
showgirls is the first big budget big studio film to receive an nc 17 rating and its release last year came at time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence but if showgirls is any indication of hollywood future the folks in washington should focus their attack on more dangerous threat to american values bad moviemaking showgirls is relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas who collaborated on another shock value project 1992 basic instinct follow the plight of young woman teen tv star elizabeth berkley determined to make name for herself as topless dancer it hackneyed premise to begin with so not surprisingly all of the stock characters are trucked out there the demanding producer the loyal friend the bitchy competitor lest forget the scummy club owner of course any attempt at character development or coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film main attraction an endless parade of full frontal nudity unfortunately showgirls doesn satisfy in this department verhoeven slam bang in your face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic to make matters worse you ll be forced to sit through the movie clothed scenes which don cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground but if it adult entertainment you want stay home and watch the playboy channel you ll be the wiser for it
here concept jean claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie now if that isn enough to get you to finally see van damme movie don know what is all sarcasm aside it is certainly different way to start movie of course few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had twin brother so lucky us we get to see more of jean claude van damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives van damme #2 is police officer in france who finds out that he had twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france the remaining twin the french cop goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death once there he hooks up with his deceased brother girlfriend played by natasha henstridge and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are jean claude acting abilities don seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie in other words just in case you missed the sarcasm his acting is worse than normal on the upside natasha henstridge is in this film and she does what she did best in species she gets naked sadly this is probably the high point in the movie she is actually decent actress but didn improve as much as thought she would after species this is the typical van damme movie with jean claude doing variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents nothing new here and certainly nothing we haven seen in every other van damme movie simply put there is absolutely nothing new about this movie it has retread plot this isn the first time jean claude has played twins he still can act we all saw natasha breasts in species although this is one repeat performance not complaining about this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in sub par
the only thing worse than watching bad movie is realizing that the film had lot of potential and could ve been effective such is the case with _urban legend_ the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house the killer wears one of those bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up so you can see the face guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days anyhow the premise is certainly nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric it very good setup that promises more chills to come unfortunately the film never takes off from there the movie takes place on peaceful new england college campus like most slasher flicks this one also centers around young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by knife wielding maniac or in this case an axe wielding maniac ve always wondered why these killers don save themselves lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill after the fine first scene the movie degenerates into monotonous series of those annoying you thought it was the killer but was just someone else scares these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music guess sudden sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast the slasher appears attacks the victim is eviscerated and the tedious cycle appears anew false scares should always be used in moderation someone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren as scary as they used to be this movie commits the biggest sin horror film can commit it not frightening remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in _scream_ and _scream 2_ this movie still adheres to them tons of illogical moments about more than really have the inclination to list and don mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense that type of illogical can be fun this film insults your intelligence more times than care to remember the last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you ll be laughing more than you ll be screaming actually you won be screaming at all at its best the acting can barely be called adequate and the script could ve definitely used rewrite or two the film still manages to have some strong points the killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans there are some intentionally funny moments these were exceeded by the unintentional ones the film is well made from technical standpoint besides the first part there is also another good scene prolonged cat and mouse chase inside radio station if there had only been more sequences like this that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music _urban legend_ might ve been worth your money
play it to the bone is punch drunk mess of movie containing good cast but awful acting an interesting premise but terrible execution ron shelton beyaz men can jump gives us rocky story with not one rocky but two rocky no is vince boudreau woody harrelson edtv bald tattooed newly converted christian whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as curse word something that he has not yet successfully achieved rocky no is caesar dominguez antonio banderas the 13th warrior best friend of vince who is currently dating vince ex girlfriend grace both men are nearing the end of their almost careers when fluke provides them with redemptive opportunity when both fighters of the undercard of vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated the fight promoters need to find quick replacement our boys are tapped to fight each other the winner of which is promised shot at future title fight the film is divided into two sections at first we have buddy road picture as our two heroes in grace sassy grassy green muscle car travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by once in vegas the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar both mr harrelson and mr banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past not that we know it from their work here mr harrelson is uncomfortably awkward apparently never having gotten firm handle on vince the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable mr banderas is uncharacteristically non charismatic as caesar weak and ineffectual there is little life in his screen performance the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another tom sizemore saving private ryan robert wagner austin powers ii the spy who shagged me and richard masur fire down below are crooked promoters lucy liu payback is sex starved hitchhiker looking for good time and lolita davidovich gods and monsters is the shared girlfriend who can make her mind up which boxer she prefers because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them the film flounders with all the appeal of dead fish until the boxing match actually begins but even then because the outcome is so predictably obvious the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other writer director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed well choreographed well edited and well performed if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film as it is the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable the title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film the phrase play it to the bone is reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you ve achieved your desired goal that is biblical principle know ye not that they which run in race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain corinthians 24 [kjv] achieving anything worthy in life requires playing it to the bone we need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives this is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives as movie play it to the bone is hardly worth our time but as principle of life the phrase play it to the bone are words to live by
have no real tangible proof of this but swear that there are lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take bad script written by bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director then it is actually possible to make good movie using their logic all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into good movie is cast bunch of super famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget this is the only way can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre now before continue to ferociously attack what wrong with this film just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller catherine zeta jones plays virginia baker an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal sean connery if you ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before really don have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details the two team up for various jobs stealing various things for various purposes the problem we come to is that we ve all seen this few billion times before and this film doesn break any new ground in the big budget hollywood action genre the result is that the entire production feels contrived going to be completely honest here pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run time was looking at catherine zeta jones now while this may be compliment for ms zeta jones it certainly isn for either the writers or the director who are not nearly as clever as they think they are just about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between entrapment and blackmail with an eighty million dollar budget you think that entrapment would at least feature edge of your seat action scenes or breathtaking special well you be wrong the action that is present in this film takes place in huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular unfortunately for all those involved with entrapment die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by 11 years the reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture you know exactly what going to happen despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists many scenes seem to exist merely as reason to outfit zeta jones in extremely tight fitting clothing one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask nothing wrong with that but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was so why didn she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ll tell you why because it great excuse to photograph zeta jones posterior as it slides underneath those beams and it also allows second scene of the exact same thing the rehearsal ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie and though he has great screen presence although so do connery and zeta jones and the most interesting character in the film not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss concept invented just to describe this picture one last complaint entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into shadow or behind building or he becomes obstructed by moving vehicle and then in the next shot he ll spontaneously disappear in ninja like fashion can picture amiel patting himself on the back thinking to himself it ll leave the audience wondering for days how did he do that we know jon it called editing
an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it hollywood existence when think of the screenwriters behind this film picture room full of monkeys the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves all of the monkeys combine their efforts hop in cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark office the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clark desk while flailing his arms and shrieking the director appears to be deep in thought until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims `i love it the writing behind this project is embarrassing for your amusement will explain the plot dr kinder kathleen turner and dr heep christopher lloyd are two of the cold hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute where peculiar studies are going on as the story goes there is an ancient myth explaining that babies ages and under know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences when they move past this phase they become like any other drooling toddler kinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies namely little sylvester sly for short who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission impossible team there is so much crap derived from this premise despite the fact it virtually identical to the plot in look who talking far superior film in any league you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kung fu tactics question it obvious the babies are super smart but why are they able to fight like jackie chan the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers it shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes familiar home alone formula also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90 knowledge quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors the effects in baby geniuses similar to the talking animals in babe are pathetic the editing is disaster and the jokes are never funny the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are `cute suppose they are can admit to smiling few times because the babies were cute other instances though was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever their entire existence is based on punch lines peter macnicol and kim cattrall as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester twin are both miscast then again don suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid meanwhile dom deluise plays fellow who gets hit in the crotch with monkey wrench hahaha would avoid baby geniuses at all costs instead of watching this would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling or perhaps you would consider going diving in shark infested waters anything to avoid this painful movie the final line in the film spoken by the bratty sylvester is `if they think doing the sequel for less than $20 mill they re nuts sequel please have mercy
susan granger review of america sweethearts columbia sony what waste of talented cast billy crystal and co writer peter tolan have concocted sly provocative premise and as the opening credits roll it obvious that they re attempting an old fashioned romantic comedy the story involves veteran publicist billy crystal who is summoned to orchestrate press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director christopher walken holds megabuck movie hostage in his editing room refusing to show it to anyone he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of possible reconciliation between the film once married but now estranged stars gwen and eddie catherine zeta jones john cusack they ll be so distracted that they won remember they didn see the movie or it wasn what they expected and crystal thought of this long before sony exec concocted the phony critic david manning quote scandal for help he turns to gwen personal assistant sister julia roberts but the laughs are few and far between crystal glib cynical flack isn wickedly funny enough with few amusing one liners after six months under the care of depak chopra like guru alan arkin cusack character too emotionally fragile lacking the necessary charisma zeta jones vain narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one dimensional only hank azaria as zeta jones much macho spanish lover and stanley tucci as studio exec and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth basically we don like these ego driven stereotypical characters let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements and joe roth direction is predictable formulaic and telegraphic on the granger movie gauge of to 10 america sweethearts is contrived shallow as screwball satire it strictly superficial
this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times it is hard to tell what is independent about this film it might as well have been made in hollywood or on home videocam it is the debut film for the director who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s where the mind set of all the characters depicted is grounded but to see it in the 1990s is different story it is old news the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn mean much since their relationship remained undeveloped the introduction of the wise guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour de force performance by the star of the film adrien brody as ray ray is the only son of low level mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield new jersey suburban basement ray sr vincent is now trying to make go of it by running small scale home repair business his son lives with him and works unhappily as shoe salesman dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open business and marry his long time waitress girlfriend joanne sybil the title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman 10b which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film you should be aware that there are lot of things about this film that don make sense its constant brainless chatter between the buddies their uneventful growing pains and the despair of their lives make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them desperate to make his dream come through ray goes to loanshark humorously and menacingly played by james moriarty and borrows 10 grand to bet on sure thing at freehold raceway the horse loses and now ray has big problems as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough there is nothing have seen so far to like about ray he is undependable mean spirited and stupid so when his best friend mike gallagher the narrator of the film gets chance to sleep with his girlfriend who cares the director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do as for ray gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen his buddies the college student mike and the dependable butchie gillan and his old man who he has this love hate relationship with rally to his aid and the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting though adrien brody showed signs that he could be future star because of his intensity and looks he reminds me of sean penn
synopsis sonny koufax adam sandler is rich childish angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa kristy swanson in bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin jon stewart and adopts year old boy named julian cole and dylan sprouse while kevin is on an overseas trip under sonny supervision julian soon learns to lie to women tell people how he wipes his ass throw tantrums and scream for his god damned treats self centered julian breaks school classmate arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong meanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk food toys and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform not surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonny incompetent supervision and this leads to custody battle opinion it movie about an embittered creep teaching little kid to be jerk and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior that the essence of big daddy but there bigger issue involved marketing movies that are rated pg and pg 13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below on tv film clips advertise these movies as family friendly hit comedies then when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment folks in hollywood are trying to develop preteen market for raunchy stuff but think most american parents would agree that early childhood is time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation to many american mothers there probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about woman ice cold tits
one would think that david duchovny star of the cult favorite files would be very careful in choosing his leading man cinema roles at least one would hope so one would be seriously incorrect eugene sands duchovny is surgeon so dedicated to his craft that he becomes addicted to amphetamines to stay awake and work more it turns out to be bad plan when he loses patient and his license while under the influence ten months later in seedy bar to score synthetic heroin the doctor gets chance to ply his trade when assassins gun down customer using plastic water bottle and bar tubing sands operates and saves his life smalltime hoodlum raymond blossom timothy hutton is impressed with the cutlery skills on his associate he kidnaps and then offers down and out eugene position in his organization blossom needs doctor to patch up gunshot victims that would be problematic at hospital sand temptation is that this will give him chance to practice medicine again albeit illegally big chunks of cash to fuel his habit and close proximity to the gangster womanfriend claire angelina jolie this film babe factor the would be big time operator is desperately in need of help on the run from russian mobsters the bad guys that seem to be all the rage in this year films and trying to cut pirate software deal with the chinese mafia blossom is surrounded by blood after few medical misadventures the physician grows disenchanted with his employment an encounter with couple of psycho surfer dudes who threaten to blow him away unless he fixes their dead buddy cements his feeling that he is in the wrong line of work when the fbi visits and forces him to become an informant there is no question that he needs to be somewhere else oddly enough these seem like they could be exciting scenes the film disproves that assumption then bunch of other uninteresting things happen writing this only two days after seeing the film its struggle to remember the events you can take that as solid lack of recommendation for all the coolness that duchovny exhibits in files it surprise that his big screen presence is so lacking in charisma the doctor is particularly bland and dull even the cold turkey bit which is rife with dramatic possibilities come across as banal little chocolate and minor sweats get him through heroin withdrawal like virtually everything else in the film it missed opportunity the fox mulder detachment doesn work here oscar winner hutton manic mobster is much more difficult to get handle on played partially for comedy and partially as crazed killer blossom almost becomes real but then sinks into goofiness most of the time hutton looks as if he searching for his character and coming up empty jolie also makes few false moves towards creating three dimensional human being before giving up and turning into scenery the most interesting aspect of her performance is watching her pouty lips threaten to take over the screen the rest aren any better michael massee eccentric fbi agent never revs up one of blossom henchmen steals few moments of the show as quirky gunman reminiscent of val kilmer doc holliday in tombstone his two gunned blasting as he does bizarre dance is the high point of the film but that 15 seconds isn worth sitting through the other 90 minutes first time film director andy wilson known for his work on the british television series cracker appears to be attempting to jump on the pulp fiction bandwagon the best of these movies combine sense of style and flash with significant substance the second rate ones concentrate on just one of these aspects playing god does neither well the basic idea of the film is solid and then it goes nowhere even worse it plods back and forth up and down long and winding road before it ends up nowhere fox fails yet again in his search for intelligent life
for good ten years or so super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene now he has followed in the footsteps of director john woo who launched chow super stardom in the acclaimed better tomorrow by moving to hollywood had some reservations about this move and it would seem was right to have them chow plays hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay debt his final job requires him to kill policeman seven year old boy this he refuses do and runs however he is forced into violent confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers are brought in to do the job cue around 80 minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot outs which take place in various locations some thought had gone into making them bit different but unfortunately they end up being just plain boring the car wash scene found myself laughing at how stupid it looked tut tut the emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music could have sworn one piece was ripped out of bruckheimer movie and not on the content mia sorvino passport forger is dragged into the affay and also provides lame love interest as well as being rather handy with gun director antoine arqua has clearly not observed chow excellent acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter few lines of broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots chow trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale which in fairness is quite good and there not even toothpick in site and as for making chow shoot like cop well that damned unforgiveable to round up the replacement killers is pretty darned lame first outing for chow it would appear he has left asia for 90 minute pop video this is not what we wanted at all considering john woo was the exec producer did he have no say so at all watch the killer again and weep at the difference review by chris hill there room at the top they are telling you still but first you must learn how to smile as you kill if you want to be like the folks on the hill
the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry cage is legendary retired car thief memphis raines don you love cute movie names who must call upon his time worn skills to save his thick headed brother ribisi from being killed seems murderous crime boss eccleston with fetish for wood insert your own joke hired brother kip to steal ridiculous amount of expensive exotic autos fifty cars to be exact poor kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly if the cars aren delivered in three days bossman has casket carved out just for kip literally if only someone could save him hmmmm wonder what memphis is doing in order to give the film some emotional heft there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of yawn excuse me dramatic tension shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe lindo who looking to send memphis away will he catch him there old flame sway jolie who had her heart broken by memphis years ago will they get back together shortsighted thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother yet resents him for moving away from the family will they reconnect raines old mentor duvall has long since left the life of crime will memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life one more time can you answer all these questions correctly in seconds without seeing the film first ll bet you can following the opening credits which fill you in on the accomplishments of the raines family through montage of old photos we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis he first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive go carts in later scene as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control all the while making breakfast metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions just as pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it big brother memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it looks like everything might turn out alright after all you know this because the music swells on the crest of violins that about as strong as the characterization gets which is shame bruckheimer has real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis or maybe it just the cars duvall trots out his ornery but sweet old codger outfit sure he still laughing at taking paycheck for this one lindo projects warm hearted but tightly focused detective that almost transcends the material the biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones who plays mute accomplice of memphis without saying word he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie like blast of nitrous oxide he attacks each scene with straightforward zeal too bad his minutes onscreen are so few somehow bruckheimer manages to attract top hollywood acting talent to high concept poorly written movies gussies up the film with lots of altin hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes every time something clever happens it counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing you re watching movie there innovative usage of siyah lighting that goes from being novelty to part of the plot it counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing driver test imagine the yuks there segment where one of the thieves shows another his cool fake fingerprint trick it countered by the lame semi subplot of car being stolen with bunch of heroin in the trunk the ramifications are never explored then there the ridiculousness of the many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars not only is it stupid but it against the law this is movie made of pretty but tepid car chases strung together by just enough character interaction to move the plot along gone in 60 seconds aptly describes how long it ll take for this marginally entertaining but empty film to leave your memory
sensuous romantic comedy about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out its the kind of stuff ve seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen lope cruz who plays brazilian chef with magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot but who can get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story pen lope was wonderful in pedro almod var all about my mother but here she is so visible in such stale story where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking that she somehow looks ridiculous as if she got egg all over her face the best you can say about her is that she not to blame for this picture being so off this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex is in my opinion worst than raunchy film that delivers what it says it will the story is all about the love motion sickness and cooking ability of isabella cruz who is born in bahia brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents cook to cure her motion sickness her parents tried every remedy until they went to spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure she is able to control it now as long as she doesn drive car ride elevators follow in dancing and is the woman on top when making love in other words she has to be in control of things in her small fishing town she falls in love with handsome macho latin waiter toninho oliveira murilo ben cio and marries him they open up successful restaurant where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it even though he loafer one night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco we don see her in flight so can tell how she handled her motion sickness problem unless she flew the plane she visits her friend apartment monica harold perrineau jr who is cross dresser blending right into the san francisco scene to cast away her love for the irresistible toninho she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell freeing her from ever loving him again her luck changes when local tv producer cliff mark feurerstein gets whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show you can really write the script from here on by yourself as the despondent toninho begins to realize what good thing he had but things continue to go bad for him there is curse he caused on the fishing in his village there is no chef to replace his wife as the restaurant is about to close for good so he comes to san francisco figuring he can charm her again he brings along with him his guitar playing musicians the ones he used when courting her when he serenaded her under her window he sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick the yuppie tv producer chasing after her and sees that she is no longer charmed by him when he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her the ratings go up and he hired as regular on the show the show gets so big that the network honchos come onboard taking it national but they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show get rid of monica because he freak have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses and they change her ethnic dresses to low cut vanna beyaz type of sexy dresses cliff her would be boyfriend acts creepy and sides with the network big shots even though he loved everything she did these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos they were revolting it was an insult to one intelligence sure that not spoiling the ending for anyone when tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up meal that breaks her spell of loving him again if the film wasn terrible enough monica and cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers it was so awkwardly done that it had no sense of truth or humor to it this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film because it doesn look or feel like an almod var film the type of film it aspired to be but more like film that was interferred with from above its more like futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic as it searches for box office heaven
even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material as this subpar submarine comedy proves down periscope stars kelsey frasier grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of corrupt officer james coburn plan to get him out of the navy like any lame emsemble comedy the officer assigns him to group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out the fat guy who eats all the time the beautiful woman who doesn belong there lauren holly the second in command who does everything by the book rob schneider the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out harry dean stanton and so on then comes the transparent plotline first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him and that comes courtesy sad sight gag montage that includes guy with mop knocking schneider overboard after the ship is fixed up come the early drills where everyone seems completely inept like the electrician who can connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone finally and this covers the final hour of the movie grammer has to lead his men and holly to overcome the other ships in wargames exercise and he has to be clever rebel to do it in scenes that stretch all levels of believability first they re singing louie louie like bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off then thirty minutes later they re making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off the whole while evil captain coburn is overacting underwater cursing grammer as most people watching the movie probably are too it all predictable without any original humor to redeem it the jokes are right out of mchale navy and other cut rate sitcoms of the past there one scene where schneider looks through the ship pantry in disgust holds one food can up and announces this expired in 1966 yelled back at the screen so did these jokes watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and around the start of the second hour started writing my will the blame can really be placed on the stars though kelsey grammer is good in this he just doesn have anything to work with his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had welcome aboard tatooed on his penis grammer probably did something even worse got really drunk and agreed to appear in movie he knew nothing about same for holley save the penis part who is likeable in down periscope just because she so gorgeous as for schneider whose character is downright annoying there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas although he still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the snl ship my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as formula comedy okay it police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber and after everyone was signed on turned into disaster judging from the video box most other movie critics agree with me the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel jim ferguson guess even jeff craig from 60 second preview who said tank girl kicks butt without ever seeing it didn like this
for timing reasons having to do with baby sitters we recently went to multiplex and saw undercover blues would give it one half of star for guts anyone in movie this bad would have to have guts later read ny times review that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid had gotten so plump they looked like they had the mumps in the show the script was the worst part they had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh they had lots of great sight gags like two people trying to go in door together and therefore bumping shoulders against the door turner and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on game show the good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet and left buy some tickets and give them to your worst enemies tell them the show is great and smile lot one of the top few films of this or any year must see film excellent show look for it average movie kind of enjoyable poor show don waste your money one of the worst films of this or any year totally unbearable review written on september 29 1993 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer
capsule lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for terminal illness potentially interesting idea made stagy and boring claire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that was waiting for someone to sneeze just to break the ice it perfect example of what my wife calls an movie where means so ing earnest movies like this need wit and brashness to be absorbing claire is one strained speech after another written delivered with all of the energy and spontenaity of dmv clerk claire takes two women claire and noel both writers and throws them together in the same cabin at women only writer retreat claire wrights light comedy while noel is scholarly authority on porn and sexual behavior obviously the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about and for the entire one hundred and twelve insufferable minutes of this movie that all they do talk the movie sets up its microscopic plot with beat dead horse into glue obviousness the evening talks at the camp are chaired by motherly type named maggie self professed lesbian and when noel owns up to also being lesbian claire looks like she been hit with sockful of wet sand the movie then quickly degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance and claire looks out over the water reflectively ugh the most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads all of this of course leads up to scene of complete inevitability claire and noel in scene that should have come an hour earlier because then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about what just happened we never get hint about how any of this has changed anyone only how they felt about things that didn even happen yet the problem with claire is not lesbianism as such but the leaden way it handled why is it that any serious better word would be adult or at least thoughtful examination of sex in movie almost always winds up producing movie that unwatchably boring the way this movie deals with lesbianism we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids many other movies have used the same subject in ways that are thousand times better more engaging more creative more intellectually and artistically interesting look at john sayles lianna or the interesting and little seen desert bloom both of them have more life and vibrancy than claire what this movie needed was good swift kick in the pants

your first clue that something isn gonna be quite right with the movie you re about to see it heavily christmas themed and its release date is oh say at the end of february your second clue that something isn gonna be quite right with the movie you re about to see charlize theron one of the movie dubious stars makes an appearance on the daily show in which when asked if her new movie any good she replies with the equivalent of verbal sigh assuring us that yeah it sure is movie all right and there some scenes like those you expect to find in movie and there some action and there other stuff too how to immediately grab my attention open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits then show caption reading six days earlier ya know was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas how to immediately lose my attention follow your opening scene with terminally dull nice guys who don deserve to be in prison scene write line for the one of prisoners like just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad then have ben affleck actually say that line on film and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor for good measure throw in poorly motivated prison riot and have affleck best buddy stabbed aw and just two days before his release too already the cliches are piled on thick and when it rains it pours how to take my attention dash it violently against the rocks and make it so that contemplating my strategy for calling shotgun about an hour before know the credits will roll deny your characters the ability to think have ben affleck for some reason ll never understand pretend he his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend played by charlize theron have gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in poorly planned casino heist the villains big idea kidnap affleck because he used to be security guard at the casino force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are then dress up in santa suits create some diversions and rob the place on paper it seems like the stuff of potential caper comedy but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he looking at the makings for some sort of clever action crime thriller it not like the man isn capable far from it he the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases ve ever seen in last year ronin but he certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr moreau step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible cast ben affleck in the role of the world most generic hero he gets no good one liners he doesn get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as car thief and wants cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie his name is rudy short for rudolph in all likelihood see it called reindeer games get it get it shut up in the past affleck has been at his best as supporting actor and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as leading man step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible gary sinise villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook filmmaker could have some up with he dirty and potty mouthed he got long scruffy hair and goatee and fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them he also extremely inept at what he does he thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises and he trusts affleck character to pull through even after time and time and time again he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him but instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role sinise seems to think he playing some sort of tough smart and smooth criminal mastermind rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script [on side note gary sinise wins this week title award as he the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings last week winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards how to take your bad idea and make things worse include two or three plot twists that instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely this is bad movie and what worse is that except for few moments near the not so stunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad if they done that much at least would have been entertained
tomb raider fun exciting challenging given the unprecedented popularity especially among teenage boys of the video game that sports an uber buff pistol packin babe who raids well tombs you have to believe it these three things and more lara croft tomb raider the big screen variant of said video game which features pumped up angelina jolie the oscar winner for girl interrupted no less in the title role is however none of these things it isn fun it isn exciting and the only challenge is seeing how long you can stay in your seat suffered through to the bitter bitter end the wife opted for barnes noble at the 45 minute mark directed by simon west with the same subtlety he brought to con air tomb raider is an empty headed big budget bore the story borrows unintelligently from that mother of all turkeys hudson hawk the same hokum about planetary alignments and sacred stones that when brought together well who the heck cares and it makes super mario bros bob hoskins ill advised career move look like rocco and his brothers that classic of italian neo realism ll go out on limb here and say suspect there actually more character development in the video game than the movie proper this is where the jolie defenders video game nuts jump in and say this movie isn about character development it about kicking serious butt or bum since ms croft hails from england green and pleasant with lips breasts and biceps all inflated to the max lara croft is all about posturing and jolie has hard time simply standing still without trying to look tough ok let forget challenging shouldn tomb raider be at the very least fun and exciting shouldn our butt kicking heroine also encompass the sophistication of say james bond with the wit of indiana jones there no humor to be found anywhere in tomb raider even though it tries hard from time to time even the mummy returns didn take itself too seriously the villain here is noticeably lacking the special effects are ridiculously overblown and unnecessarily complicated and the script is non existent to liven things up perhaps jolie live father jon voight puts in few minutes as lara dead father lord croft talk about stretch one thing hadn expected from the film is that jolie affects slightly better english accent than her pa although suspect that thin looking moustache he forced to wear gets in the way some unsuccessful not entirely if anything lara croft tomb raider makes you want to check out the video game itself to figure out exactly what all the fuss was about
can recall previous film experience where the fairly good time was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota for forty minutes or so was lured into loopy if occasionally over wrought romantic comedy and was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt then rather suddenly was clubbed over the head with nasty bit of violence shortly thereafter was whacked in the gut by another feeling minnesota is film that made me feel violated as though had trusted writer director steven baigelman to bring me cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face feeling minnesota tells the story of topless dancer named freddie cameron diaz who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss kirmizi delroy lindo suspects her of stealing from him red punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper sam clayton vincent onofrio who is far from the man of freddie dreams enter jjaks keanu reeves sam estranged younger brother who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie eye and have sex with her in the bathroom united in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam jjaks and freddie take off together but sam isn ready to let them go without fight freddie meanwhile isn ready to let sam money go without fight and thus begins series of violent confrontations there is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam intense sibling rivalry as boys and their mother tuesday weld sending jjaks away to live with his father it does great job of setting up jjaks unstable life life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family reeves wounded look is just right for jjaks the wedding sequence includes number of nice moments most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which simple question is given very funny spin most important baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy as in scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements will dare on the car radio you would have every reason to expect that relationships both familial and romantic would be the focal point of feeling minnesota unfortunately you would be dead wrong suppose should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which kirmizi threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding but certainly didn expect what got what got was yet another in long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality or rather creating gags about brutality suddenly the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes story about corpse and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another but there is no consistency to the characterizations vincent onofrio turns in manic performance as sam whose jealousy competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks while reeves turns into framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood there are films which have managed to employ radical shift in tone successfully jonathan demme something wild and neil jordan the crying game come to mind but they didn try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment don want to dismiss baigelman successes out of hand he gets fun performance out of dan aykroyd as crooked cop and some well crafted comic moments and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as light hearted caper it _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value and that he can make his two halves into whole feeling minnesota left me feeling used and there not much funny about that
highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature beams itself onto russian science vessel well this is the point where the movie strays from becoming decent and original movie and simply becomes predictable sci fi thriller anyhow this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the virus known as man the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated and then hapless crew on tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies the movie is that predictable the story is full of very shallow characters that don do much other than subsist the captain of the tug played by donald sutherland makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age looks to be in his 60 to add to this we re shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific in typhoon no less none of the characters seem to work together at all they are always bickering and vying for some form of control this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in tub and someone is simply creating waves it looks genuinely fake granted trying to recreate typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish also on the topic of flaws the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly why if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics should it not be able to create them move faster regardless the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it as to the actual casting for the movie finally there is nothing to complain about the actors were superb but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe watching these actors act this story out made it bearable if barely the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch mediocre sci fi thriller then you won be too disappointed as the movie is but the latest in genre that was originally created by aliens it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv
an american werewolf in paris is failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis 1981 feature an american werewolf in london where the original had comedy the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit coms where the first installment had chills this one has sequences that are inappropriately unintentionally funny in short while an american werewolf in london has become something of minor classic in its genre the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity the film opens with trio of daredevil americans andy tom everett scott brad vince vieluf and chris phil buckman sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do little bungee jumping soon they have company in the person of serafine julie delpy who has decided to end it all she jumps but andy with bungee cord attached goes after her and manages to save her at the price of major headache serafine disappears but smitten andy seeks her out however once he learns his would be girlfriend dark secret he wishes he hadn she werewolf cursed to change into hideous beast when the moon is full and to make matters worse he has suffered nasty bite himself actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie she imbues serafine with spirit spunk and humanity which gives us an emotional stake in the character fate this isn necessarily good thing since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as completely mindless campy entertainment experience delpy injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with better script and better cast surrounding her delpy previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski beyaz and richard linklater before sunrise she was radiant charismatic and effective in both given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here she gets as close as possible to those adjectives it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one miss and if your primary objective is catching glimpse of her in the buff check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts the rest of the cast acts at level considerably below that of delpy which is to say they give performances appropriate for the screenplay tom everett scott that thing you do plays the lead like he in made for tv movie it would be kind to call him bland actors vince vieluf and phil buckman as andy friends are no more impressive julie bowen happy gilmore is suitably fetching as werewolf meat and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has brief turn as another monster meal on the technical side it all bad news the computer generated werewolves look painfully unreal the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits repeated use is made of the werewolf cam an infrared wolf point of view approach that interesting the first couple of times it employed then becomes tedious and the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on screen action they re matched to director anthony waller who displayed confident edgy style in mute witness stumbles with this material never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel as result we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii your sister is werewolf will give waller credit for killing off dog though something that rarely seen in movies these days an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in bad movie sort of way but that dubious distinction ultimately it an unfortunate effort for while it isn unbearable to sit through it isn howl either
if you don think kevin kline in drag is funny wait til you see will smith in drag it even less funny by the time jim west smith disguised himself as belly dancer to bail his captured comrade artemus gordon kline from the clutches of evil dr loveless branagh was unequivocally bored by wild wild west the new summer blockbuster from men in siyah director barry sonnenfeld is the old west really breeding ground for high comedy anyway if your answer is no then you recall rustler rhapsody or back to the future part iii if your answer is yes you re thinking of blazing saddles but that movie was parody of the western genre not nineteenth century romp 1869 jim west is quick draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon under orders from president grant kline again whose impression for all we know is dead on to apprehend legless loveless the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states and sell it back to britain and spain how will loveless accomplish this well by hulking around the desert in an enormous mechanical tarantula of course bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar hayek whose scientist father was kidnapped by loveless joins west and gordon on their gadget filled train gordon first discovers rita in cage waiting to be rescued racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically with west despite the movie hip attitude toward the siyah thing west automatically shoots anyone who calls him nigger before that person can finish speaking the word super at any rate kept waiting for rita to say something humourous but she walking dress up toy her single comic moment is also the best shot of the film she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peek boo flap of her pyjamas jim west is the role that finally stymied will smith whose comic timing has always been hit or miss as episodes of the fresh prince of bel air demonstrate smith better reactor than actor which is why he was so thoroughly engaging in men in black he didn start out hero in wild wild west he required to exude eastwood cool and amuse at the same time and from frame one difficult feat not sure any living performer could pull off smith is ill equipped for example to handle the moment in which jim west performs stand up for some rednecks at his own hanging what attracted sonnenfeld to this material this isn the first time he has adapted tv show for the big screen the addams family anyone but it the first big stinker of his career as director wild wild west is poorly paced bombast full of doa gags ted levine shows up as general who uses gramophone horn for hearing aid levine played buffalo bill in the silence of the lambs he too intense to get an intentional laugh lousy special effects the bluescreening is amateurish foregrounds are never proportionate to the backgrounds and frequent illogic to wit its ridiculous villain so badly wants jim west out of the way that he drops him onto steel platform to do battle with some generic ugly henchmen instead of shooting him at point blank rage with one of the many guns on board the tarantula wild wild west bright spots such as the cool opening credits sequence bai ling all too brief appearance as femme fatale or the brilliant his master voice joke are all part of the film first half which is more clever and enjoyable at least than its second when towards what seemed like the end of wild wild west gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane and west rejects it there was collective groan among audience members it meant we were going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before gordon builds the glider the invention of which would inevitably lead to the proverbial whiz bang finale
wow film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever amazed that someone thought this was story that must be told on screen many blacks in hollywood complain that they are not nominated for awards based on their race think first they need to concentrate their energy on themselves and stop making movies which makes them look like nothing more than sex crazed buffoons even offended by it bill bellamy is player which means he sleeps with lot of women and lies to them what pleasant main character one day his friends decide that they want to find out how to be player why they decide this one day have no idea how many years have they been friends and why all of sudden would they want to learn anyway bellamy agrees to teach and his wonderful lesson to his friends consists of letting them ride in his car while he rides from house to house having sex with women this is the bulk of the film folks guys riding from house to house one keeps getting out to have sex while the others sit in the car since russell simmons is producer and since the official title of the film is def jam how to be player was ready to be jumping up and down and stomping my feet and beating the person next to me because of the comedy amazingly aside from gilbert gottfried 90 seconds of screen time there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such manner instead of jokes there just an endless stream of profanity and naked breasts and naked breasts aren so bad but naked breasts alone don make good movie be sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well gilbert gottfried character serves as one in his very brief appearance asking for explanations as to what is being said they should have brought him along for the entire film [r]
what do you get when you rip off good movies like woody allen bananas and martin scorsese after hours you think you get the best of both films instead you get woo falling in somewhere between def jam how to be player which was awful and booty call which was ok woo is yet another in the embarassing genre of showing african americans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons the whole film plays out as siyah version of after hours as wild woman woo jada pinkett smith goes out on blind date with straight laced tim tommy davidson mayhem follows them for some unknown reason read contrived screenplay davidson puts up with all of woo antics for the entire night which include her destroying his bathroom mirror stealing things from his house violently questioning him accusing and belittling him actually about previous girlfriends causing riot in an elegant restaurant and other various infuriating things that any normal person wouldn tolerate but for the sake of this bad movie sure why not there are few chuckles in the film the best being the scene swiped directly from bananas in this case davidson is running from thugs gets into subway car as the doors are closing starts to taunt the thugs then the doors open back up again good joke but stolen one another chuckle is provided by billy dee williams cameo as himself movies like woo are seemingly released every three months or so and not one of them has ever been hit woo won be one either so why was it made and more importantly isn there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive everyone involved should really reconsider their careers at this point [r]
like good action film should metro has action that keeps you involved some action films have action sequences that are so conventional our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts the ghost in the darkness which opened few months ago is film that action was so bland and uninvolving it not only invited my thoughts to divert me it nearly put me asleep but metro is one of the best action films in while it is hip sharp nifty and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy eddie murphy was in bad shape for while and this invites me to mention last year the nutty professor which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be metro happens to be lot better than any film in the beverly hills cop series that is because metro takes itself seriously but doesn prevent itself from having little fun eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible and controlled people the beverly hills cop movies all featured eddie as reckless wild cop always crossing the line by just an inch in metro he plays hostage negotiator so negotiation is his job not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble his character in metro takes himself seriously eddie murphy mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in metro and perhaps it is quite better off that way murphy plays scott roper and as previously mentioned he is san francisco hostage negotiator in the first tense situation in the film we are introduced to roper kind of work as he tries to calm down confused unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up murphy handles the scene seriously without his usual happy go lucky misfit humor the film develops when its villain is established and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda jewel thief and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim metro takes different twists and slight turns and there is one great virtuoso chase scene involving the cable car cars flip cars crash cars turn over and it is done so good in this film was reminded of speed and the speeding bus that couldn go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons there are also some other good scenes in metro that lot of films would rather choose not to have scenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner few little methods of betting and winning of course the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling the scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice too those are the scenes that make up metro which is mainly about eddie murphy maturing as personality the actor that most enjoyed seeing in metro was michael rapaport who plays roper new partner lip reading book skimming genius and master of observation it was not the actor presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of proclaimed genius rapaport is an actor who usually see in the role of the dimwit the really really dopey dimwit hardly recognized him in metro and it was quite joy to be able to see him in role like this feel that respect him more there are two main types of villains in movies like this the ones that are part of the story and the ones that are devices the villain in metro is no more than device but he is darn good villain nonetheless he is played by michael wincott whose voice is pushed out in abraded rasp as if he smokes cigarette between every take wincott makes his villain korda as mean as could be the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down flight of stairs just for kicks like richard widmark in kiss of death and in addition wincott physical appearance and mannerisms in the film actually reminded my of an arrogant friend use to have who is no longer on my good list liked metro and do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy his past roles were the great ones but they were also precursor to the maturing that would later take place possibly from murphy growing as person now having family metro is no nonsense movie it works as buddy movie which it does not overplay it works as dry comedy which it does not overplay it works as suspense film which it does not overplay and it works as an action film where it does have tendency to occasionally go all out but who cares it still remains serious and it does not overdo itself oh and there were plenty of explosions in metro as well how nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those if there is one major objection had to metro it was the length an area where lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes metro is film that lasted little too long but it was still entertaining and it gave me something to do while waited for it to end paul haynes
there should be requirement that potential viewer be under certain film iq in order to see mission to mars there are probably quite few people who are going to enjoy it and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind but there are those who will not and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies 2001 space odyssey armageddon apollo 13 the abyss close encounters of the third kind the extra terrestrial alien and aliens why because there is not one original idea in mission to mars all of it is cribbed from other films and in most cases better films if this is the sort of thing you don mind you might like the film of course there are other reasons not to like mission to mars the main one being script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven used their brains in some time and who don intend to start during the film running time mission to mars manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time the plot cribbed greatly from 2001 concerns team sent to mars the first manned trip ever made to the kirmizi planet luke graham don cheadle leads the team jointly formed of americans and russians the team encounters mysterious monolith that emits strange pulse this being nothing like the pulse emitting monolith in 2001 that one was on the moon but when they try to study it giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them all except luke who survives long enough to send garbled message back to the rotating space station which looks strangely like the rotating space station in 2001 rescue mission is planned with husband wife team woody blake tim robbins and terri fisher connie nielsen obligatory pilot with troubled past jim mcconnell gary sinise and extra crew member phil ohlmyer jerry connell along for the ride after some zero gravity dancing they run into problems when one of their engines is blown forcing them to attempt desperate landing aboard supply vessel now stranded on mars with minimal supplies the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home after all that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth mission to mars is one of those films that makes critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it so let start with one of the things that does work director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in few scenes during the middle of the film that it everything else fails the failure isn de palma fault he working from an atrocious script only during the sequence aboard the ship looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in 2001 where the rescue team air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does mission to mars come to life scene where they attempt to save comrade floating away into space also provides some tension until you realize that the entire danger more danger attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film it just contrived way to generate thrilling scenes take it out and the plot isn affected in any way the sequence also suffers from few plot holes as does the rest of the film why is the ship computer which sounds strangely like hal from uh 2001 able to detect hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine why did tim robbins character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside shouldn the astronauts be better trained to deal with hull breach why are the characters such idiots because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them all the conflict is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing long opening tracking shot during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know jim it too bad you can go on this mission because you were determined psychologically inadequate because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together does anyone really talk like this can we find out these things in less grating matter like maybe in flashback the whole film is like that the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what going on they must tell us exactly what we re looking at every time sample dialogue from the film shot of mars astronaut look there mars astronaut you sure that mars astronaut yeah that mars all right astronaut hey are you guys looking at mars that exchange isn actually in mission to mars but wouldn be surprised if it were for all their cribbing from kubrick spielberg james cameron and even ron howard the makers of this film haven learned to do something all those directors did very well show and don tell de palma used to know how but seems to have forgotten this is mentally challenged filmmaking they assume the audience won get what going on so they explain everything five times over fourth graders may appreciate this but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted the principal actors sleepwalk their way through mission to mars never managing to do away with an apparent just here to get paycheck attitude cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines armin mueller stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard decent guy performance and sinise hams it up with wistful facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife played by kim delaney who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in heavy handed monologue about the meaning of life and especially during the stolen from no less than three movies lollipop to whoever names them conclusion which combines endless obvious explanation and sub par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then and of course these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in 2001 who facilitated the evolution of life on earth those aliens were from an unknown world it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy mission to mars but such comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow going leisurely pacing might have helped film with little more substance to it but all of the substance of mission to mars has been stolen from other films and those other films dealt with their ideas in much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters supposedly we re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one totally different from the one character decides not to return ending of armageddon but suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning me alternated between the two there is only one good thing about the way mission to mars finally ends the fact that the movie is over
warning may contain slight mild spoilers rated for intense violence gore some strong sexuality and language starring arnold schwarzeneggar robin tunney rod stieger gabriel byrne running time 132 minutes we go into movie theater boom the lights go down our hearts race we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie we ve been waiting to see for long time comes on we sit there watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is why shouldn have know what was getting myself into again like this past summers hit stigmata end of days may be worse it not like this is any kind of original idea it just throws in some rosemary baby along with the devil advocate little exorcist and some stigmata here and there whala you have end of days movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific sadly but truly again like most recent films all the good parts are in the trailers the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be hit in the first weekend and flop in the next jericho cane arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role is cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan living in gabriel byrnes body and stop him from impregnating christine york robin tunney because if he does and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist he has to do this before it turns into the year 2000 and strangely he trying to fight him minutes before 2000 comes he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger in terrific role and tries to save this girl leading to an ending that satisfying but turns into typical action movie that pretty much it on plot it does have the razzle and dazzle of great action movie and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it parts you have to wonder where all the money went as for arnie good role ok performance think since he is getting little older he is held back lot of his stunts the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film in the trailers it looks like good scary action film and ends up being boring long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions gabriel byrnes who ironically played priest in stigmata here plays satan and gives good performance but again seems held back and not into his character two years back al pacino gave terrific performance in the fun the devil advocate and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also robin tunney great performance as always plays satan main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isn nothing new the direction by peter hyams is at times bit overblown though not nearly as the visual style was in stigmata here we are given great camera work and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just don work in this movie the script written by andrew marlowe has few witty lines but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax was ready to go home only few things work here and those are few of the performances the writing and visual style but the storyline and the finished product don work as well the sad thing is that end of days had so many things going for it the plot could have been more organized the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mind numbing at times it seems like armageddon and started to get old and tiresome hollywood is running out of ideas bad and like ve always said before needs new ones even with its 100m budget end of days is less than pleasing in fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over and easily could have had 70m budget maybe sound crazy but am really looking forward to the new exorcist film and hope that they make it as good as the original we need to get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just to make money at the box office we need to get more films like the blair witch project that could scare people to death while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them and how do know that it is in fact the blair witch overblown effects stupid and thin plot line good performances disappointing umm yup those pretty much describe end of days
ugh that about sums this movie up just ugh the original godzilla movies are somewhat of cult classic and when reviewing the previous films each film had certain degree of intelligence and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following in spite of bad special effects horrible dubbing and man in lizard suit they maintained certain degree of how to put this dignity not quite the word looking for you understand right and in 50 years godzilla has maintained that degree of whatever leave it to america to screw the whole thing up >from the geniuses that brought us independece day arguably the worst sci fi movie of all time to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had while they do bring us eye popping special effects that will amaze you they lost what was at the center of all the original godzilla movies storyline summing up the movie is simple heck can do it in one sentence giant lizard attacks giant city and bunch of nobodies stop it simple as that matthew broderick stumbles over his lines and it hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dog walking character on the television show mad about you the dialogue seems to be improvized almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all can see the scene on the set right now all right we spent all of this money making big special effects and we ve gotta get this movie out by summer or it going to bomb in our faces so you actors just say what ever comes to the top of your head all right make up something kay good roll film the special effects are enough to keep you interested through one viewing and some of the cinemtography is well done the scene with the siyah umbrellas comes to mind still an hour into it you will become antsy wondering how long they can drag it out and drag it out they do have to laugh the slogan for the film is size does matter think they cut this too short it should read size does matter acting does not
not so long ago men by the names of peckinpah ford leone and eastwood made westerns real westerns these were some of the best films of the twentieth century those days are gone now we have crap like wild wild west to pass for the western and that record is not improved with the unbearable tale of american outlaws outlaws is yet another re telling of the jesse james legend courtesy of movie king james robinson producer of such classics as wrongfully accused and chill factor delayed since the spring this version stars the irish hunka hunka burning love colin farrell the best part of schumacher tigerland as the bad ass jesse james alas any sense of his character has been left on the ranch leaving us with only cute chicks like ali larter minus the whipped cream to watch the spin this time around fresh from serving as southern militiamen in the civil war jesse james farrell his brother frank gabriel macht and his pal cole younger scott caan lay down their arms and head home to missouri to tend the family farms after the war has ended but trouble is brewing in their small town of liberty when evil railroad baron thaddeus rains harris yulin and his cronies rollin parker terry quinn and allan pinkerton timothy dalton demand the boys turn over their lands to the railroads the jameses and the youngers then join forces to fight the railroad by robbing banks up and down missouri thus cutting off the railroad financial surplus and playing robin hood to the local people along the way the boys squabble over who the cutest of the gang who the most popular cowboy in the gang and who ought to go on mtv total request live they rob numerous banks with identical interiors always with the kindest of hearts strutting in their grungy dusters as moby songs play in the background the witty banter they share could be plastered within hallmark card the biggest disappointment here lies in the acting of colin farrell after great job in tigerland farrell walks through this role easier then nicolas cage in gone in 60 seconds and his american accent rivals richard gere irish accent in the jackal combined with feeling like bonanza the teen years this homogenized production toned down to get the ever popular pg 13 rating gives us an invincible jesse james that quickly grows tiresome and boring the unbearable villains courtesy of timothy dalton and thaddeus rains spend the entire film proclaiming that everyone should be hanged sucking out any energy left in the film not to mention the real story of jesse james and his gang bears no resemblance to the plot of american outlaws instead the movie is full of old outrageous tales about the wild west tales which went out of style in cent magazines about century ago
when robert forster found himself famous again after appearing in jackie brown he immediately signed up for little film called american perfekt this was almost two years ago waited patiently for the film to be released but it never was finally forgot about it the other day though while was perusing the selection of the local video store stumbled upon you guessed it american perfekt immediately rented it and with certain amount of glee rushed home to view it having now seen the film understand why it never saw theatrical release american perfekt is jumbled mess the storyline is non existent it took me half the movie just to figure out what was going on and at that point the only thing really knew for sure was that the movie was never going to introduce plot of some sort it wants to get by on quirkyness and so called charm alone and it just doesn work robert forster plays psychiatrist who picks up amanda plummer and they head off on the road together along the way to no discernable destination they run into all sorts of kooky and wacky characters suppose this free wheeling no plot style is supposed to give the film an element of danger and excitment but all it did was make me sleepy all for trying new things within the realm of film but not at the expense of coherence nothing in this movie makes sense the actions of the characters go unexplained even when they re truly bizarre ll give you an example without giving too much away david thewlis has part as drifting con man at one point mid way through the movie he runs forster and plummer off the road with his car as he passes them we see that his face is covered in blood do you think we would get an explanation as to what happened to him you would think so wouldn you american perfekt is waste of time nothing is gained from watching this movie except maybe migraine and if you do rent it don bother trying to figure out what going on in the hopes that everything will be resolved by the end this doesn happen and no explanation is given for the misspelling of perfect either

it seemed like the perfect concept what better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter than to make movie about guy with split personality it exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care to the wind to get laugh jim carrey signed on too even better the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly as schizophrenia and so forth such protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers fire proving that some people just couldn take joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy yes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie isn funny it not for lack of trying the farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most high concept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites man who after being dumped by his wife for midget limo driver decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them this of course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too forgiving nature making his job as rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult soon enough charlie repressed aggression manifests itself into second independent personality named hank deep voiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster this guy isn above crashing car through the wall of the barber shop in which he been insulted or holding little girl head underwater because she refused to stop jump roping in the street then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film runs off its tracks some have suggested that this isn problem because the farrelly brothers brand of humor doesn require plot to work they re wrong of course plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort 1996 there something about mary 1999 outside providence was technically an earlier project the brothers earlier film wasn funny merely because it contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected in mary the farrellys managed several times to pull off neat sleight of hand trick they have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion me myself irene by contrast seems to have been made by folks who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work having been produced by the same guys who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment the brothers pile on the offensive humor taking shots at race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner of bathroom jokes but they haven come up with way to make any of it fresh most of me myself irene comes off as rote by the numbers adolescent comedy the plot with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene waters renee zellweger who in more trouble than anyone knows back to new york has an ending that entirely predictable from the get go think charlie and irene will fall in love yeah me too the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven already expected them to do no matter how outrageous their actions might be compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing this stuff is almost entirely soft tossed presenting an obvious problem when gross out humor loses its shock value it no longer funny merely gross the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry take for example the subplot involving charlie three siyah sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon the incongruity of it all is funny for while with three burly siyah men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too pleasant smile on his face but by the end of the film they re still doing the same schitck it hasn been elevated to another funnier level and it hasn been dropped either that too bad because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through me myself irene reeks of wasted opportunities there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie new personality and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank actions this doesn really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie condition early on so they don have any opportunity to be surprised by it the film throws what looks like patented farrelly curve in scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script doesn go anywhere with it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax jim carrey is gifted comedian both physically and vocally but he left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in manner similar to steve martin in all of me it great showcase of flexibility and split second role shifting but none of it is terribly funny carrey doesn pull any stunts we don expect him to pull and the farrellys script doesn give him anything else to pull the situations in which he must perform the role shifting aren set up in any meaningful way perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better zellweger irene is not strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strong willed irene is nothing in particular as the film never makes clear whether she ditzy clever or neither as such she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only sane person in the film chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straight laced for movie like this he like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected after viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked but don believe it good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style if the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and still think they are they ll rebound just fine even after that happens though ll still consider me myself irene to be high caliber misfire
based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad victory spins tale of pair of lovers heyst william dafoe and alma irene jacob who seek refuge on heyst isolated island however their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones sam neil martin ricardo rufus sewell and their servant pedro graziano marcelli who have come to steal heyst rumoured plunder while the novel is largely complex in characterization the film sadly transposes conrad characters into lacklustre leads the most disappointing being heyst himself conrad heyst adheres religiously to his late father ways of detachment and isolation his ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice the struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude however is lost in mark peploe director and writer diluted version of heyst without properly establishing the crucial details of heyst character all that is left of conrad main character is very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement on the one hand actualizing the subtext is mammoth task though not impossible but on the other hand dafoe flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism in the end we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another the final transformation while perceptible lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad novel its absence in the film is unforgivable the film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers alma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship namely heyst underlying philosophy of detachment which heyst himself grapples with the struggle against heyst ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma love for him jacob fair skinned gentle and yet passionate handles the role with precision detailing nuances where possible unfortunately she is let down by superficial script the couple relationship develops too hastily leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with blatant show and tell approach all we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone this is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried thoughts and emotions the sketchy handling of their relationship stands out as sorely as dafoe american accent an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london the other characters such as schomberg jean yanne the owner of hotel and mr jones sam neill also fall short of conrad meticulous characterization while schomberg should have been more menacing and vindictive mr jones should have been portrayed as something more of an enigma sam neil caricature of slightly stout effeminate and soft spoken gentleman at large ifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as an insolent spectre on leave from hades endowed with skin and bones and subtle power of terror poor characterization aside kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo secretary to mr jones reckless ruffian capable of murder sewell with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity masterminding deceitful plans behind jones back at the same time we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans despite the authentic setting and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer very few images are left behind for us to savour after the film has ended sourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have their charm but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence of an epic which is what victory deserves to be the delicately inter woven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate production at the end of the film we are told that perhaps alma victory was in teaching heyst how to love hollow victory indeed the flying inkpot rating system wait for the video little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
the comet disaster flick is disaster alright directed by tony scott top gun it tells the story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on collision course with earth and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble jeez after great opening in which an american spaceship plus the city of new york are completely destroyed by comet shower nasa detects the said asteroid and go into frenzy they hire the world best oil driller bruce willis and send him and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem that like sending mouse into cat carrier isn it the action in armageddon are so over the top nonstop and too ludicrous for words had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook couple of times was not alone plus to see wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is film like armageddon is waste of the actor talents the film is just reel to show off bunch of snazzy fx shots the only real reason for making this film was to somehow out perform deep impact producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon
years ago robin williams made _jumanji_ brilliant achievement in special effects but travesty on nearly every other level the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ boring illogical weepie wannabe that left my senses numb don get me wrong love breathtaking special effects and pulse pounding imagery _brazil_ is on my personal top ten _the city of lost children_ is great film because of its outlandish scenarios even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ being in the minority amidst my friends _what dreams may come_ imagery aside has little daring thought to complement its imagery the daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized it idea of plot is so lukewarm that it insults the bigger questions it raises it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences put on an electronica soundtrack and sell it as one of those popular _mind eye_ videos robin williams plays chris nielsen who dies too prematurely not only in the story but before we have chance to really know and care for him the director vincent ward and the screenwriter ronald bass have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife big mistake it would have been far better to take the half hour or so needed to tell his life story first ala _it wonderful life_ so that can build up respect for him so could know and possibly care for him his children and his long suffering wife played superbly by annabella sciorra instead the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses it doesn so in the afterlife chris learns that people still don meet god that our thoughts are reality and time does not exist there hmm i+ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative the not meeting god part still irks at me but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect that said this alternate reality still makes no possible sense read on chris wife commits suicide since suicides go to hell chris would be separated from his wife forever the important question is is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love good question and like good thought provoking questions don+t like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question _loathe_ it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes popular rescue film especially rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously _really_ loathe it when it+s story is no longer run by logic but by special effects hey chris did you forget your thoughts are _real_ they are more _real_ than the physical world according to the new age screenplay so why don+t you conjure up positive thoughts of annie and let that run wild and then she would appear before you and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity because there would be no movie that+s why and albert the angel played by miscast cuba gooding jr says bluntly that+s fantasy umm if your thoughts are more real than the physical then fantasy is not fantasy but real surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that and if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person and that your thoughts aren big enough to sustain you for eternity well in all due respect that why don subscribe to this theology all due respect another idea based on time pause does not exist here so chris spend your eternity with annie as she is on earth reliving your favorite memories or hang out with her when she was growing up you+ve got eternity perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out and forcing her to write still exist in her diary imo is just too tacky there are many other ideas all of which are hundred times better than what+s unraveled in the plot the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before and just come out stale most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects so when they finally show themselves he realizes they were with him all along and when this happens the film runs in slow motion as if to build emotion _gag me with spoon_ so the only things for me to like are sciorra+s effective performance who rises far above this mundane material and the special effects please note that while enjoyed some of the visuals did not enjoy _all_ of them some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe everybody floating up and down in invisible strings it sounds like joke but it+s really true really tried to block out the dialogue and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack my vote goes to rare cd called never say die 1981 from petra christian rock group it+s pretty good and they have song about annie who commits suicide it+s too late for annie she+s gone away for good there+s so much we have told her and now we wish we could but it+s too late melancholic yes depressing yes but far more entertaining so in case you don+t know let me be straight suicide bad _don+t do it_ no no no got it you shouldn+t have to pay $7 50 to hear this in an awful robin williams schmaltzfest
the original _babe_ was my favorite movie of 1995 sleeper hit that transcended its target audience being surprise commercial and critical success it had no marketing tie ins which limited its final take thus babe arrives with budget greater than the money made in babe plush dolls vending machines hawking shirts and macy thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money grubbing too late this is sad review to write because babe not only does _not_ live up to the original but it doesn even come to fraction of it shouldn expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors magic but this film tries too hard and loses its charm consider driver applying the accelerator with great intensity unaware that his car is in neutral imagine with me if you will _scream_ jamie kennedy explaining the rules for sequels like babe there must be _more_ talking animals there must be _more_ slapstick comedy there must be _more_ songs for those mice to sing that cute keep the story cards to break up the action that cute too even though the pig gets wise made no sense given the context of that story partition there must be action however illogical that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to the baa ram ewe secret code the that ll do pig that ll do now throw in the limitations james cromwell now hot commodity has limited time on the set or maybe he didn approve of the script christine cavanaugh the voice of the original babe demands more money $200 000 paltry considering the $80 million budget out daily comes in with noticable results george miller the director is more well known for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment not for kiddie fare and no he didn direct that _andre_ film in 94 the special effects are impressive _but limited_ babe talks but most of the time from single shot repeated over and over again babe is center screen looking straight into the camera with happy smirk regardless of whether he happy or scared or tired season now with the original elements which as we will find out are straight from the screenwriting is hell bin change the venue into the big city this has been praised as wildly original excuse me didn _home alone_ do this several years ago how about the muppets even _the bad news bears_ travelled to tokyo sorry no dice side note to give the city fairy tale look george miller crafted fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the world great cities and yes it _is_ impressive but this too is over used repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions and for the most part babe _remains in the hotel_ ii given the limitations of cromwell the human element is taken over by the boss wife played by magda szubanski she not lead actress type she not funny enough in her physical comedy and she simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls have her arrested falsely on drug charges have her accidentally incite riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes have her bounce around on bungee cord at prestigious benefit dinner was hoping for little smirk during these scenes but felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film the violence the scene where pit bull dangles from the bridge head submerged underwater even the best fairy tales have bit of the macabre in it as the brothers grimm have demonstrated no my problem is with the story or lack thereof _babe_ is sent out to save the hoggett farm but once in the city that story is forgotten being good natured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice but other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull what did babe actually _do_ without giving the ending away the farm is saved from left field quirk that had nothing to do with the pig speaking of pig or pig pig pig pig pig the word pig is so overused had they changed it to an expletive and had the pig be al pacino could have been watching _scarface_ this is screenwriting further cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups had it been cartoon and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd maybe my reaction would have been softened but to farmer hoggett his wife an elderly mickey rooney much too irreverent quick splice those singing mice into those scenes the film isn colossal failure did like glenne headley schmoozy chimpanzee liked the pink poodle the dog on the cart who momentarily thinks he in dog heaven and weird looking guy who may have been doubly cast as an airport employee and judge but most of the time was looking down in boredom or in embarrassment over the hacked up script them singing mice those chapter partitions the proficient acting of the animals none of these can compensate for story let me spoil the final scene farmer hoggett looks at pig proud says that ll do pig that ll do that it hope didn ruin it for you but tell me this what the heck did that pig _do_
lauded as genius by many stanley kubrick commands superlative filmography that includes such critically acclaimed films as 2001 space odyssey clockwork orange lolita and dr strangelove or how learned to stop worrying and love the bomb now sadly he added eyes wide shut to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first and only blot on his near flawless copybook kubrick alas should have quit while he was ahead this much publicized psycho sexual tease thon with its star billing of real life marrieds tom cruise and nicole kidman is nothing more than one long two and half hours long boring exercise that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut kubrick faithless to arthur schnitzler 1926 novella dream story has confused eroticism with nudity he has confused intellectualism with talking slowly he has confused profundity with pretentiousness in addition the director has made some strange casting choices leaving sydney pollack in and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel and jennifer jason leigh out pollack the director of such box office hits as tootsie and out of africa is normally solid in his occasional acting stints but here he miserably out of his depth and there isn much depth to begin with unhappily there not likely to be director cut of this film to determine whether the decision to exorcise keitel and leigh was the right one in fact with the exception of the stark black and white credits snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack and many many grainy tracking shots down lavishly decorated corridors there none of kubrick trademark brilliance in this film it doesn help that the story as delivered is ridiculous cruise and kidman who bring little more than marital torpor to the project play well to do new yorkers bill and alice harford he doctor and she an unemployed art gallery director and they share central park west address at an opulent party hosted by their friend victor ziegler pollack alice gets little tipsy and starts dancing with jeremy irons like hungarian who singularly determined to get her in the sack bill too is seen arm in arm with couple of models before he pulled away to deal with an overdoser back home bill and alice smoke little pot before alice aggressive jealousy kicks in as retribution she confesses to her husband that she once had deep feelings for naval officer she eyeballed at hotel where she and bill once stayed this hurtful admission sends bill into tailspin he pounds the streets of the village in his heavy siyah overcoat struggling with black and white images of alice in the grip of horny midshipman it all way too much for him for revenge bill almost has sex with hooker he almost has feelings for underage girl he sees in costume store then he almost does the hooker roommate and he almost involved in an overblown rococo orgy when an old college chum of his tips him off to mysterious password protected party where everyone wears masks and the women are incredible naked this erotic set piece cult ish bacchanal complete with chanting incense and lots of strategically placed partygoers covering up the dirty might impress the likes of hugh hefner but it lot less shocking than it intended to be what the big deal bill doesn exactly do anything other than throw his money and credentials around and alice only ever lusted in her heart whoop dee doo still they make up at the same agonizingly slow pace was kubrick notorious for multiple takes paying them at an hourly rate even geniuses have their bad days eyes wide shut just happens to be kubrick bad day an unerotic disappointing and altogether pointless end to an otherwise memorable career
the army utilizes number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done one particular field manual is known as the fm 22 which among other things covers the practice of saluting under the saluting section is sub section which covers how salute is rendered by military work detail in the presence of superior officer the salute is rendered by the highest ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail in any event the salute is rendered only by the man or woman in charge rather than by the whole group almost at the very beginning of the general daughter we see general motorcade passing work detail everyone salutes it looked impressive but it just wasn right that little bit showed me that someone either didn do the appropriate research or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene in fact this would serve as metaphor for the rest of the picture as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to good movie what results is film that looks good but like that one scene just isn right the first fifteen minutes of the film is good example paul brenner john travolta is an agent for the army criminal investigation division undercover at georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale prior to the transaction the buyer gets whiff that brenner isn the unscrupulous supply sergeant he supposed to be and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living so ensues cat and mouse action sequence which ends like certain scene in raiders of the lost ark we ll just say that it involves propellers brenner then receives new orders when the commanding general daughter captain elisabeth campbell leslie stefanson is found naked bound and dead on one of the base training ranges he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill madeleine stowe to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder what want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary it gives no insight into brenner other than the fact that he little cocky does the arms subplot turn up later no so why add this extra running time to the film the answer it looked cool or how about the atmosphere the beginning of the general daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south thick trees dirt roads sultry colors over water all backed up with bayouesque music nice immersion in the setting but it soon doesn matter for when the film plot shifts over to the murder investigation so does the entire mood no attention is paid to the location of the story and the music is altered to fit very generic thriller theme did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making different movie instead of creating cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie as ve already mentioned an entire section of the film doesn jibe with the rest and the characterization only adds to the difficulty brenner who comes across as man with little respect for authority suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell james cromwell and utters some of the corniest yes sir ve ever heard he even delivers an emotion charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general daughter even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just couple of minutes previous sunhill who initially comes across as professional investigator utilizes couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information and even revels in her ingenuity both characters are protagonists but it hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place and in some cases simply unappealing could imagine that during filming west would shoot scene then take the actors aside and tell them let do it again but this time want more say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good in this film they overact in most of their scenes an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general aide colonel fowler swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention far cry from his days as linc in the mod squad can help but think he was acting from west direction couple of side characters including west point psychologist john beasly and young female private ariyan johnson make their scenes nearly impossible to bear the only two actors who seem to have escaped west influence are james woods who provides good performance as colonel moore elisabeth mentor at the psychological operations unit and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police woods relishes the role of man whose job is playing with people minds and does so without ever taking it over the top hutton just kind of hangs around but at least he wasn overacting haven read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based but ll bet more than few dollars that the story was better in book form the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished every time we re presented with some new aspect to the case west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it the most momentous discovery ever but the information is not used by the investigators at all instead when conclusions are drawn they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts but lucky guesses instead the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill letting them play game of twenty questions with the suspects then letting them guess who the killer was would ve been over in half hour the film finishes with sort of bookend featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning literally during the closing credits we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off they both seem kind of happy maybe they were driving away from simon west
don appreciate it when thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting when in fact it ludicrous in the case of the general daughter the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to certain point but at this juncture in the story the movie begins to fall apart like crumbling cookie this predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of it detailed flaws get past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent and you re likely to survive this entire movie travolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner who working undercover at military base when another situation arises the apparent rape and murder of young female officer leslie stefanson it turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell let the investigation begin with the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill played rather on the sidelines by madeleine stowe brenner uncovers what appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case things begin to get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore james woods former commanding officer of the deceased who has few secrets up his sleeve woods submits another scene stealing performance here as he oozes authority surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar with echoes of his supporting role in true crime in which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges he makes every moment believable here though the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta as the two send mindful knowing glares across the room there are many scenes such as this in the general daughter in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb director simon west con air shows watchful eye of delivering stylish looking thriller but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part of it the general daughter is more often than not predictable and unexciting mess it does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless dragging it heels all the way at mind numbing snails pace few brief action scenes marvelously handled in the editing department show that the movie could have delivered such more proficient package from director who does such great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts suggest west should stick with mindless rip roaring action features and attempt to avoid future projects like this still the movie is certainly not without it merits the acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast the performances range from commanding travolta to electric woods to stiff as board cromwell who doesn show off his real talents here madeleine stowe manages to hold her own for while but as the female lead in an action thriller she doesn pull through sufficiently one of the problems with the execution is that it very predictable >from minute one had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question the script even unwillingly points him out for us using familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end in all fairness we ve seen many of the devices used in the general daughter put to greater effect in other films the secrets behind the girl mysterious death are explained gradually but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly the general daughter is not terrible movie and it is involving enough to sustain viewer attention span for certain period of time but it just could have been so much better
didn hate the big hit even though it is stupefyingly terrible film for the entirety of its running time my eyes were attached to the screen and never once got bored found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness this is such confused disaster of film that it entertaining to watch it in the same way that it entertaining to witness thirty car pileup on freeway spaghetti bowl as narrative the big hit is pure garbage never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries it reminded me lot of grosse pointe blank which is similar film that fails in lot of the same ways it fine to mix genres if the film makers know what they re doing unfortunately writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don seem to know how to handle the material and the result is an action film that wants to be comedy the biggest problem with the amalgamation in this case is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place but it sure is fascinating failure marky er mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley hitman he good hitman apparently although his tactics seem bit rambunctious he doesn snipe or make clean kills he just kicks the door down and shoots everything he works with few other hitmen cisco lou diamond phillips crunch bokeem woodbine and vinnie antonio sabbato jr they re nice bunch of muscular guys who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex they all work for man named paris avery brooks who is rich powerful and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own this of course is where the plot comes in they decide to kidnap young japanese girl named keiko china chow who has rich father when they do this it turns out she is paris goddaughter it very bad to have paris against you the story is standard action film stuff it nothing new and nothing particularly offensive but certainly not the slightest bit compelling clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it john woo type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy it true that lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea such as face off and the replacement killers which are both far superior there are stunts that are fun to watch the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns melvin is also very good at breakdancing and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives like said it not boring most disasters aren what makes it so bad is its genre shifting madness it seems to start out as quirky but realistic action comedy as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains then as soon as they go to their first hit it turns into music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere then somewhere in between it turns back into comedy keiko turns out to be spunky little girl in one amusing scene she is forced to read letter out loud indicating that she has been kidnapped but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words and scenes like this work alone but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious or not be in the film at all one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped when cisco gets there paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it but they let him out of there telling him to find the perpetrator the scene is played for laughs but it isn funny and since it doesn quite work as comedy it tries to fall back on the action which also fails this is film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with handgun cars land on tree branches and are supported by them characters betray each other without second thought grenades are thrown in tight places people jump out of tall buildings and survive people outrun tumbling cars and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds most frustrating of all though is the film definition of hit man these guys are anything but subtle quiet and skilled individuals they re more like socially depraved militia men melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage including missile launchers and hand held machineguns the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest this obviously doesn make for deep or interesting people to watch the acting is kind of fun though wahlberg is good actor and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in silly sort of way phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character while christina applegate who plays melvin fianc is convincingly air headed the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny the funniest parts are supplied by the actors and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one liners it true disaster one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional despite all this though must reiterate the entertainment value here you can cherish the awfulness of film like this if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is you just might enjoy yourself
cried during _babe_ admit it the special effects the story the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was children film so much so that yes got little overly sentimental such my friend is the power of cinema when word came out that they were using this newly developed for doctor dolittle update in which eddie murphy plays the title character and many great comic actors supply the voices my anticipation rose to great expectations they can possibly drop the ball on this one can miss can possibly miss they missed what went wrong after much thought supply three general rules don let television actress turned comedy movie director near an urbanite script penny marshall dreadful preacher wife betty thomas worked wonders with the brady bunch movie but the same sitcom airiness doesn quite work here it as if she lifted generic sitcom and iced it with light doses of modern r&b take away the siyah cast take away the atrocious soundtrack and you have the residue of some mid 80 kirk cameron show the greater the cast the less the individual cast member has to do con air it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman garry schandling john leguizimo ellen degeneres and gilbert godfried in your lineup but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped stereotyped characters one line at time it even worse because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you don get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits now there are three character actors who do get special treatment albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he in and the scenes as depressed tiger do resonate certain poignancy norm mcdonald fares nearly as well as stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle but there little humor here that rests on the shoulders of chris rock sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wise ass guinea pig even the mouth is ill synched don let the special effects technicians walk away with the script there certain timing that mandatory in comedy to have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson creature shop is travesty this is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren well timed laughfests with the right director they can be and have here betty thomas is clearly over her head wish could commend the special effects but they re merely average count the number of times where the animal mouth is turned away from the camera or too far to notice or ill synched this is less babe and more of look who barking clone you may be wondering how does eddie murphy fare well he came back with the exceptional nutty professor and don doubt he can come back again here he tied into straight man and given little to do the exceptions are when he fears he going crazy far cry from his smarter than you expect routine that he more adept at it unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years after all this what left butt jokes _lot_ of butt jokes guess for kids that may be funny but was stone faced if there lesson the film may be telling us is that animals have feelings too and they care way too much for your butt
well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task he has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films in domain that he owns it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell good action script from bad one eraser back in 1996 was confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense batman and robin in 1997 was the siyah sheep of the batman series with ridiculous acting idiotic action scenes and painfully flashy costumes now in 1999 end of days not the end of days is the third strike in tough at bat for arnold is this the end of powerful action star long lived career will arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable classic like those in the past terminator terminator judgement day predator or an unforgettable performance in great guilty pleasure like those in the past commando kirmizi sonja true lies it doesn look that way end of days begins with the birth of baby girl in 1979 who inexorably due to the formation of the stars on that night will be the carrier of satan baby the hour before new year of 2000 fortunately for the movie sake the girl grows up and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers subway trains in dark tunnels and myriad of inept nypd officers it an action film dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up imagine if the girl had lived in anytown usa where the only thing to destroy is dairy queen and post office arnold schwarzenegger jericho cane in series of boring events finds himself in the middle of religious battle between the church who is trying to hide the girl or in some cases trying to kill her and satan gabriel byrne who is trying to make her pregnant if the devil is successful the world will no longer exist as we know it jericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because he once had faith but no longer does and his wife and daughter were killed and he feels responsible for it jericho cane is your cliched by the numbers hero right up to his name arnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can he shouts at everyone from cops to priests to the devil in one truly hilarious scene which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point jericho screams to the devil you are @#$^% choir boy you are choir boy those two lines marked the high points of this film movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor end of days fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception of gabriel byrne byrne playing man who has been made the manifestation of the devil seems to be the only one who is having fun in this whole movie he wonderfully plays manipulative villain with the power to control everyone at any time the annoying thing about his character however is that he has the power to kill any human with simple punch in the face yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho and taken the girl from his custody the other actors in the film give very weak and unconvincing performances kevin pollak who plays the partner and close friend of jericho is the supposedly funny character in the film every action movie has one the one problem is that pollak does not deliver one funny line robin tunney plays the chosen mother of satan baby with extreme annoyance she gets no sympathy from any of the characters in the film except arnold who pretends she is his wife and daughter or any of the viewers in the audience in one unnecessary scene tunney walks out of her room and takes her top off is this her job in the film the actors are not to blame entirely because the script is terrible you can tell script is terrible when you are able to predict what will happen minutes before it does this little prediction game is very fun exception to trying to sit through this nonsense of movie in last attempt to make this movie good special effects are used to try to entertain the audience but without memorable action scene in the whole film the director has not done his job successfully this film would have gotten c+ if arnold stood in front of camera and shouted you are $@^@ choir boy for two hours
cradle will rock is the latest effort from director actor tim robbins while he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995 dead man walking he gets little overconfident and sloppy here the story is confusing and filled with many subplots so ll try my best and explain it as simply as possible the film is based on mostly true story about federal theater in the 1930s that produced play the cradle will rock that apparently was offensive to some so the government shuts it down it during the time of the depression and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs or are poor between this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots about those who work in theater or those associated also along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience tim robbin just keeps piling on political views and characters that we just give up on the film or in some cases walk out for robbin it may be nice achievement but to me it seemed more like friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue and fancy outfits thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast unfortunately are all uninteresting except for few let me recap what each important character does so please bear with me it the least you can do especially if you were considering seeing this ll begin with those involved with the play there orson welles angus macfadyen who of course is the director of the play the producer john houseman cary elwes marc blitzstein hank azaria the writer of the play emily watson woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock outside the play there the ventriloquist bill murray who wants relationship with federal theater clerk joan cusack another subplot involving painter diego rivera ruben blades who unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage john cusack there few other actresses and actors who have their own stories susan sarandon philip baker hall too name few but those that mentioned were the most significant to the story anyway most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted except for emily watson who does another great job and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack who always delivers through thick and thin now although most of the film was weak to say the least there were some nice moments and some involving subjects but all this is overblown sure the free speech segment was nice feature but not when it becomes repetitive the whole film is like this and it basically nothing but headache on the brighter side tim robbin direction was masterful his camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas anderson latest magnolia only smoother in my opinion but even that can make movie that much better although it has it moments not many of them but they re there cradle will rock stays true to it title because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over
disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life richard leonardo dicaprio sets off for thailand there he meets crazed man by the name of daffy robert carlyle who gives him map to beach secret utopia then commits suicide richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel tienne guillaume canet and fran oise virginie ledoyen once they get there the three discover secret society existing on this beach there richard falls for fran oise this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element which is solely creation of hollywood seems to hold to the original novel the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking don think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning but that is were many things go wrong darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking the plot of the movie moves along at decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts this is where the movie has some great potential then the three travelers get the island and there is turn for the better yes folks said better now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost un watchable there is even video game style sequence that borders on the disgusting it doesn make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion and am hoping many other peoples am hoping that in my little rant ve made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing so if you go see it and you don like it because of this don blame me the character development was not up to par either found the character of richard to be nothing more than spoiled child although there is feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard leo character comes off as wannabe philosopher the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason granted some people are like this myself included but nor anyone know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough richard is obviously obsessed by fran oise at the early stages of the story yet there is actually very little development along this story line this am sure contributes to the movie lack of core plot and being unfocused now shall move onto something little better about the movie for all you cynics out there the movie did have few good things about it the cast and acting was passable at the very least and think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard mind you think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much think this is topic all on its own so won get into it but like the fact that there was an international cast used had only and american cast been used can see this movie being horrible the international flavor added more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable not to mention the movie is set in thailand and global cast makes more sense when all is said and done liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable would not recommend this movie to anyone the fact that liked it has lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt if you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings
have you ever heard the one about movie so bad that it made guy run out of the theatre screaming obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment and so to finish us utterly they have now released urban legends final cut this is another scream like feature consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip offs from the most pointless movies of all time amy jennifer morrison is film student who is attending film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have clue about what to do but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university film program where each year best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize virtual one way ticket to hollywood success she has chance encounter with campus security guard reese loretta devine whose tale of series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at fictional thriller organized along similar lines soon enough fake and real blood starts to flow and amy is being chased around by scary killer while her cast and crew get slain one by one is the culprit the original urban legends murderer just some random psycho member of the faculty one of her competitors for the hitchcock or is there something even more stupid going on this is another one of those tiring pointless teen slasher flicks neither scary funny or interesting it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain the body counts and screams continue to grow as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly in fact watching films like that after having watched scary movie is impossible keeping serious face several times tried to prevent myself from laughing without succeeding and then realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing it the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century how many times must we tolerate the same clich that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them they are the most stupid meaningless predictable and soulless films in existence however director john ottman manages to make urban legends final cut into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre what was done with sense of redemption for past failures and irony in scream ottman takes seriously for that reason alone it is worth look just to realize how bad movie can be it tough to find comparisons for such an achievement and we have to dig in ancient history to find movie that would match its intellect even movies like lost in space and mission to mars seem spectacular in its shadow we have not seen such waste of ime and resources since showgirls 1995 no matter how hard tried to find positive elements in this so called production came up with nothing except the way the killer was dressed here feel that have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie sylvie deveu that have wisely replaced the well known scream mask with very elegant fencing mask jennifer morrison stir of echoes is all right and the other actors best achievement is keeping straight face when pronouncing the words from the script in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film with the exception of its screenplay is its portray of film schools if these graduates will be the directors of the future then hollywood golden days are over rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing third installment let just hope and pray that it just an urban legend
when ponder childhood memories past one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the inspector gadget tv show with my older brother truth be told we were rabid fanatics our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr claw the inspector arch nemesis was never biggie on nostalgia but you just can help but have fond memories of something like that sometimes even find myself up at 4am watching re runs of my favorite episodes trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder felt as kid at the very least was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me despite how horrid film may be the simple task of rekindling even slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up so back sat with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver let face it exactly how good can live action disney film really be was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr magoo and george of the jungle two previous disney adaptations and wish to god that had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well rarely has movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind was left sitting there absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what had just seen can something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world right from the beginning knew was in trouble in the opening scenes each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be to simply serve as real life duplicates of their cartoon clones when referring to them people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who certain character is supposed to be oh hi penny is brain with you creating one dimensional replicas is one thing having mere names take the place of them is quite another the plot shall we call it stays fairly in tune with the original series matthew broderick stars as john brown how creative is that security guard who is horribly injured by pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex why rupert everett for the love of god why who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events brown is then rescued and used as prototype for new law enforcement technology wherein he joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form drumroll please inspector gadget >from here on out the movie becomes hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations although to be fair my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind there something about an evil gadget taking over the city his first crime must have been swiping matt dillon dentures from there something about mary and it all ends with what else bunch of post credit nonsense and cameo by don adams himself to be honest wasn much paying attention to these treats was just glad that it was over
back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention new line cinema put on lavish presentation for its big screen update of the cult 1960s sci fi tv show lost in space complete with in person appearances by cast members mimi rogers matt leblanc lacey chabert jack johnson and even gary oldman that should have set off my warning alarms the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in person cameo to peddle last action hero but no like millions of others bought into the hype and got lost if only had gotten lost literally on the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped together blockbuster wannabe you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film at the convention goldsman claimed to be rabid fan of the original television series and if that really is the case hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is narrative to begin with which there most certainly is not after the setup in which the robinson family father john william hurt looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews mother maureen rogers wasted daughters judy heather graham ditto and penny heavily made up chabert looking like junior version of neve campbell in wild things and son will young newcomer johnson making the best of it and pilot don west leblanc doing bad han solo impression find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr smith watered down but still lively oldman cashing paycheck and loving every minute the script stream of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along and hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting they encounter another ship they board it alien spiders attack them they return to their ship the other one explodes they land on deserted planet and so on an attempt at plot involving time travel occurs in the third act but goldsman doesn seem to understand the rules that come with using such story device when one character past self dies the future incarnation inexplicably lives on the look and effects should be lost in space ace in the hole but hopkins even manages to botch that for big budget film the visual effects are incredibly shoddy in one composite background shot could see the mavi outline around oldman the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like digital effects but nothing in those shots is as jaw droppingly unconvincing as blawp monkey like space creature that becomes penny pet entirely computer generated and every inch showing it blawp looks like it was lifted directly from sony playstation game apparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it how else can one explain the graininess of blawp composite shots with the human actors but in doing so the seams are that much more obvious you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by crystal clear solo reaction shot of judy new line is hoping lost in space will become big franchise much like the long running star trek cash cow at paramount don think so in few years the lost in space movie will likely live on not as series but as the obscure answer to trivia question what film ended titanic 15 week reign at the top of the weekend box office
the only two really good things that can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows jane march was very cute as jane and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length if you haven already figured it out didn like this movie very much the plot was boring and contrived to the extreme tarzan casper van dien has now left the jungle and living in civilized society he is just days away from his impending marriage to jane played by the aptly named jane march back in his former home of africa group of looters has found the key to locating lost city mind you never really figured out why they actually wanted to find this city anyway tarzan old jungle friend appears to him in vision tarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city he leaves jane his first mistake in my opinion and travels to africa of course jane is hot on her ape man heals the two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys sound like dumb explanation of the plot it actually an improvement over the real thing the acting is just plain awful not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film but it wasn acting jane march wasn heck of lot better but at least she is easy on the eyes compounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re recorded and ve seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies added to the sound problems was the cinematography this film was filled with beautiful african scenery but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me quite frankly think you could probably do better job capturing the beauty of africa with camcorder than this bunch did with professional film equipment then we have the special effects special effects in tarzan movie you are no doubt asking yourself yes friends the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements into the story probably for the sake of using cgi since it did nothing but hurt the story in most parts they weren bad just nothing special but they were more than little on the hokey side except of course when we got to the ridiculous climax of this movie the grand finale special effects went right into the toilet at that point it almost looked like they had run out of money these effects were of noticeably lower quality than those in the rest of the film and looked like something in an amateur video production took one lesson away from watching tarzan and the lost city ape men and bones that morph into skeletal warriors don mix stay far away from this version of tarzan
silly performances and some huge gaps in logic mar an otherwise interesting tale of an eclectic group of people stranded at the last stop cafe and motel due to heavy snowfall one of the stranded is colorado state highway patrolman adam beach who discovers murder scene and bag full of cash from recent bank robbery someone amongst the group of strangers is bank robber and murderer but is it the same person or are there multiple criminals adam beach unfortunately was the wrong choice for the lead in this film he doesn play the role with enough seriousness to be believable or enough goofiness for it to be funny his performance is stuck somewhere in the middle and this film really needed it to be on one side or the other rose mcgowan is cold and unpleasant to the eye as always and jurgen prochnow what on earth is he doing in this best performance comes from william taylor as cheesy yet still somehow cool and confident wayne newton drifter type the last stop is available on dvd from sterling home entertainment as usual with sterling they ve filled out this dvd with extra features the disc contains the film in its original aspect ratio of 85 choice of dolby surround sound or dolby digital surround sound full length audio commentary track with director mark malone interviews with the cast and crew the original trailer and the usual cast and crew biographies the film itself might not be the greatest but sterling effort of adding decent extra features while keeping the price affordable suggested retail of $19 95 makes this dvd worth the money [r]

what to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography ie the garbage known as snuff films nothing right what to like about film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography well nothing so why make it hollywood there no reason why the average sane movie goer will be interested in such topic no one is going to enrich their life or have good time by watching material such as this the lack of quality filmmaking in 8mm from technical to acting stands out even more when you consider the star writer and supporting cast all reputable but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again like paul schrader schumacher has his moments but they re few and far far between basically this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it why not walk out well this wouldn be thorough review about thoroughly bad movie here why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of 8mm first thing if you don heed my advice then understand what you re about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud it not easy to watch didn know the details of the story beforehand but at least my ignorance can help others now the ha plot revolves around tom welles nicolas cage as surveillance expert and private investigator rich old woman discovers snuff film in her late husband safe she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl it had to be young girl didn it schumacher who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead she horrified that her husband would have owned such film in 8mm of course and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find family man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque murder let me backtrack for moment see snuff films are pornos with violent twist people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead however the deaths are often staged and in those cases special effects and good acting make all the difference very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard to find movies the thought of this industry makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review but ll swallow my bile and move on welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry you think he sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him he comes across smut clerk max joaquin phoenix who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze after lot of digging and bribing welles finds the men who are responsible for making this and other snuff films skip ahead skip ahead skip ahead led by dino velvet peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance and star torturer machine christopher bauer they have big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue the movie doesn end there unfortunately because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do become vigilante this film doesn draw you in it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close it is possible to like film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ie se7en but it takes large measure of restraint schumacher has none and larger amount of talent schumacher has little by those jabs not only referring to his stylish destruction of the batman franchise but time to kill was an immensely overrated disappointment for guy who gets so much studio money his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled good screenwriter and good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter writer andrew kevin walker didn recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for 95s twisted thriller se7en director schumacher doesn have that innate ability to make you watch things you don really want to see like better directors are capable of doing he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don see is more frightening than what we do especially when it scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered however gratuitous is joel middle name he must think that not flaunting hard core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint no he doesn go that far but we see enough unpleasantness he doesn leave much to the imagination it manipulating to hurt or kill young girls just to get the audience on the side of murderous vigilante the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ha ha craft case in point shot of christian fellowship bus good right drives away to reveal one of the villains bad right see no subtlety does joel think we re stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery who do we root for in this mess is there anybody out there it not all the director fault though why did the actors sign up for this nicolas cage is an oscar winner for cryin out loud if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda what is cage supposed to be in this movie whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash he was so solid as concerned father in civil action guess ol nic pete and jim were promised mountain of money or they re suckers or they just don care there are moments albeit brief ones where this rises above the wasteland catherine keener is good although too quick to threaten divorce as mrs wells baby cindy is obviously cute and wells devout love of his daughter is sweet the mother amy norton of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter this film has an appropriate blue toned washed out look like payback which was much better movie the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue but at other times it rough during some conversations close ups and wide shots are not cut very well making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren good and whose timing was half second off such technical error indeed stands out speaking of standing out don believe the misleading trailers there not much action here occasionally yes but not as often as your tv will have you believe after seeing 8mm may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again is that positive well if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing dirty movie again is their motive they ve done swell job here it ll be long time before give schumacher film another chance unless lose my mind and become seriously depraved but today not depraved so ask why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it sure that somewhere right now there some pretty sick crap going on but that doesn mean need to know about it yes mr walker your script tells us that there are some screwed up folks out there yes mr walker the proverbial monster doesn look like we expect him to you said all that in 1995 move on this film serves no purpose it doesn entertain it doesn teach us anything it doesn make statement beyond the obvious this stuff is bad approach only if this film awakens the authorities to find way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile that not likely to happen though so 8mm is indeed scummy waste of money orson welles said years ago in tribute to film to movies to good movies if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in hole like snuff films 8mm should never have been made now excuse me while go try to forget ever saw it useless trivia joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme he used it in batman forever in batman robin in time to kill in falling down and it rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow
guilt guilt is something felt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time the penultimate thriller basic instinct made my last few teenage years worth living but know so well that it terrible film made by terrible director incapable of feeling guilt verhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls and on november seventh 1997 unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me who cannot control the urge to see giant bug movies the pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year simple beyaz on siyah title card reads starship troopers my friends and speculated that the night before the prints were shipped verhoeven realized he forgot the credits is this how hundred million dollar movie should open were the rest of the film that subdued starship troopers is about group of beyaz blond haired himbos and bimbos who all have spanish last names they graduate high school join the military and then rather curiously decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all lifeforms on that planet the story is so incomprehensible and told so bombastically it akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in foreign tongue aside club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasn changed in the future one plus starship troopers contains some very funny sequences specifically the newsreels of the future hysterically funny actually but the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between the storytelling lacks focus to say the least the politics of the film are scary the actions of the major female characters are dictated by their out of control libidos there even creepy sex scene the lovely dina meyer makes out nude with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater just the way he seems to like it use the term sickening because van dien is the least appealing actor ve encountered in big budget picture all chiseled features and machismo he even barks eulogy at funeral like military orders of course verhoeven probably the one to blame and perhaps jealous because so disgusting at any rate movie called starship troopers shouldn be about sex exactly ten years ago verhoeven made robocop which was about nothing but skillfully made and oddly moving and rated despite its goofy premise maybe it asking too much for verhoeven to make pg movie then he master of insipid violence however ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it

came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor an innocuous enough on the surface romantic comedy it not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity but there it was nonetheless sat there watching this marshmallow of movie unfold when suddenly realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 in word it the same thing that wrong with so many movies circa 1999 writing more to the point it the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you re telling story about relationship the bachelor is merely the latest in long line of films where we re expected to get dewy eyed over any pairing of attractive pleasant people just because they re attractive and pleasant in this particular case attractive and pleasant exhibit is jimmy shannon chris donnell single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage it scary notion for jimmy even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit anne renee zellweger his girlfriend of three years convinced despite his reservations that it time to sh or get off the pot jimmy proposes to anne very badly anne refuses which leaves jimmy in very odd position when his eccentric grandfather peter ustinov dies and leaves very specific video will jimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is married by 05 on his 30th birthday stays married for 10 years and produces child there are only couple of minor problems jimmy 30th birthday is the next day anne is nowhere to be found meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex girlfriends it wacky brewster millions esque premise acknowledged as such in one of the film better more self aware lines of dialogue the kind where shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters at least that would be the case if jimmy weren already world class altruist screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will if jimmy doesn get married not only will he lose all the money but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him costing hudreds of jobs from the outset jimmy motivation isn cash it the livelihoods of his devoted employees it almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play role in the bachelor plot development by any human standard the guy is impossibly selfless and that the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness there never any tension between the two star crossed lovers because there no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake the blandly nice donnell couldn pull off randy cad if he tried so the filmmakers don even let him zellweger anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to but no one dares make her anything but the woman lightly wronged and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation the parade of sit com set pieces had better be damned funny since they re all that stands between us and blissfully sweet foregone conclusion ll admit couple of those set pieces are amusing including ustinov rantings about procreation and restaurant full to bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly like the shudder inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in church you re never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from film like the bachelor but that not the real problem nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm fuzzy conclusion it leading up to the problem are beginning and middle that are equally warm fuzzy there no spark no energy no humanity it an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer digestions we ve reached point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don even have pulse the bachelor is love among the mannequins
there have been merchant ivory costume dramas with more of pulse than the mod squad self consciously hip cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many baby boomers well said squad certainly won be pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards contemporary take on this decidedly 70s show doesn exactly seem unwarranted but one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf didn transform into full blown case of botulism how curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad insisting that the latter is group of people working together and then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for sizeable chunk of the running time they are julie pete and linc reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd exposition put out of the way so fast that you re likely to be lost from the opening moments on and they are respectively played by claire danes giovanni ribisi and omar epps talented actors each deserving of better than this their plight involves standard cop corruption stuff as our would be protagonists catch wind of an internal cover up after their superior reliable dennis farina one of the best things here and gone so quickly gets killed and framed for drug trafficking they pout lot and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that would impress the hardy boys and linda tripp but few others when you re supposed to be asking what going to happen next you ll instead entertain thoughts like who are these people and why should care or aren thrillers supposed to contain thrills not that danes epps and ribisi don give it shot danes can do the troubled teen thing in her sleep as evidenced by my so called life but she saddled with mysterious boyfriend josh brolin subplot so see through you begin to seriously question her so called intelligence ditto for ribisi saving private ryan looney loose cannon though at least he performs with wild and crazy vigor that occasionally demands attention but epps poor epps epps higher learning is so short changed he reduced to literally waiting around for bad guy to chase him all this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters one of whom scott silver is also the director they must think that if they dress up their stupid story in such spiffy trappings the look of the film is really quite impressive it ll somehow pay off but this mod squad plods anyway characters are non existent present are just some good looking young things modeling cool levis and cooler attitudes plot hardly escapes confusing convention and the one genre element you think would be show up in generous portions few nifty explosions some fights any kind of action whatsoever only rarely makes it to this dull gabfest all those quick to put down last month inept but serviceable my favorite martian update need to take step back here small to big screen translation that really should ve stayed in its former incarnation mod or not
by the numbers film which introduces characters situations dilemmas and developments that we ve seen before in parade of other films film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one film which is packed to the cap with predictability leading to very little tension excitement suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience in short clich ridden formula film welcome to my review of the general daughter plot an undercover army detective and rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughter rape torture and murder they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules and the hush hushes to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder critique by the numbers see above this film is just there it sits there on the big screen for couple of hours floats around goes away hopefully never to be heard from again it is so predictable that even blind man could see its plot points coming mile away it as suspenseful as leaf dropping from tree it as action packed as canadian curling tournament get the picture sure did it too bad that it took my friend and less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot and to break down each scene before it was even completed easy as pie it unfortunate because james woods and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film but alas was not to be that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted woods chews it up in the few scenes that he in travolta passes the test cromwell plays well cromwell and stowe is window dressing with smile mia since 12 monkeys 10 it seems and this predictability isn reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or few good men it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen it like riding bike other scenarios which sponge out any tension suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually breaking down to the investigators without much reason given ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly and directorial style that can only reward director simon west with solid nomination for the best poor man michael bay doing his best poor man impression of tony scott add two scenes with sunlight shining through some half open shades for grit and integrity and an all out rainfall for the finale for further chaos and you re great director yawn yeah whatever tony mean simon and aren we all sick of hearing about these army bad boys and their overdone code of silence enough already next subject please see it on video if you wanna fall asleep after seeing much better movie like an officer and gentleman 10 otherwise save yourself the trouble and go take crap instead you ll feel much better afterwards trust me little known facts about this film and its stars ironically john travolta turned down the lead role in an officer and gentleman which eventually went to little dickie gere ironically on james woods part he completed one of his earliest acting roles on tv welcome back kotter starring none other than john travolta actor james woods recently confirmed reports of his big dick on howard stern radio program unlike rocker tommy lee woods is also alleged to have an iq of 180 he apparently scored perfect 800 on his verbal sats and 779 on the math section what man john travolta is married to actress kelly preston and they have son named jett travolta loves them planes word on the street is that the kid was apparently conceived during weekend at demi moore and bruce willis home director simon west first film was the jerry bruckheimer produced con air 10 before that he directed tv commercials including the budweiser ad with the dancing ants yippee veteran director john frankenheimer ronin 10 the manchurian candidate portrays the character of general sonnenberg in this film the imdb reports that when senator robert kennedy was shot at the ambassador hotel in los angeles on june 1968 it was his good friend john frankenheimer who had personally driven him there that day clarence williams iii who plays colonel fowler in this film is known to some from his role as linc in the original mod squad tv series younger folk may remember him as prince father in purple rain
often similar to little boy lost in park that he had no right venturing into the call of the oboe toque do oboe is disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray many elements of the film are solid and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know but they simply don convert into solid work although setting is never established it becomes apparent the film takes place somewhere in latin american village in present day the community is dull one where every day is downhill slide from the last over time the people have taken to themselves the town cinema is closed no tourist has passed through in years and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger so what happens when tourist paolo betti does arrive one day he sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock it is revealed that he is musician who plays the oboe as hobby when he sits down in the park one day to give solo performance the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years it is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to silent film thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages the woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner leticia vota who also happens to be engaged to the town police inspector figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance involvement with this musician the rest of the plot closely resembles freak show gone horribly astray it features character who literally rises from his grave woman who has phone conversation with god and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character to an almost humorous drunk technically this film is nightmare the music score is poorly edited into the film so it is often choppy rough and abrupt the lighting is poor at best which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be relevant fight is filled with dialogue but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words in addition the pace of the film seems uneven it opens with series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one patience the film then moves into faster pace that again slows towards the end as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark there was however potential for this film it is piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music and the re unification of people these are all topics that could easily fill movie perhaps if there were no freak show and the technical aspects were to improve there might just be thing of beauty at the end most importantly though the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours aren such bore until then there seems to be little more hope for this piece than that boy has by simply crying out mommy while he wanders astray in park
steve martin shines but sgt bilko fails to impress based on the popular 50 sitcom sgt bilko follows the string of old sitcoms to movie conversion fever remember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back brady bunch was moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy but the tv conversion movies are hitting our screens like wildfire sad to say with mixed success such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following the more likely the sitcom will be made into movie sgt bilko frankly have not seen any its original tv version even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd failed to entertain sgt ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool place of vehicle storage and repair of fort baxter though totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out money making opportunities from running gambling den in the military garage to pools though materialistic in mind bilko methods has thoughtfully `enriched the lives of the men of fort baxter providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that colonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn `blissfully confused state bilko has managed to hide his operation though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it bilko state of ascent is suddenly under fire when the pentagon sends major thorn tough cookie on army regulations to check on the progress on the $70 million hovertank project new weapon under development within the fort grounds to add to his problems thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of major `sabo done on him by bilko during their younger army days director jonathan lynn who directed my cousin vinny in which marisa tomei won an oscar for best supporting actress managed to pull sgt bilko through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of laughter but that is about it there are really not enough laughter packed moments in sgt bilko to fully entertain the average movie goer still steve martin sgt bilko is played with finesse and full force by the renowned comedian without him sgt bilko would have just fell flat on its face sgt bilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year but doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world the current trend in mixed successes in such tv conversions may be blessing in disguise really at least it will force hollywood to re think any of its initial intentions to turn another tv idea into movie or at the very least approach those ideas with more creativity unless you are fan of the tv series or love to watch steve martin in action you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres sure there are better ones around

have nothing against unabashedly romantic films when done right with at least slightly evident restraint they can be engaging sweeping appealing but it hell of shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle hollow boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers the ones willing to buy into ephron whiny views of life and romance tom hanks and meg ryan two of hollywood most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed repectively baldwin wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son jonah seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse jonah senses tension and calls talk radio show to tell the world about their problems sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out ephron has him do this so that annie reed meg ryan can hear it annie is happy woman she is engaged to walter an allergy prone working man and seems to be perfectly content but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it five years after this movie hit theaters hanks ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better although still sub par romantic comedy you ve got mail which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet at least that movie had sense of spontaneity here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie donnell but none of them can save the film from being bore its characters are dull and empty its script isn funny or particularly charming the script has fundamental problem annie gives up for little reason her life with walter to pursue sleepless in seattle whom she has never even seen it the kind of life decision that real people don make and its major unforgivable plausibility sacrifice in essence this movie purpose is to head towards goal that shouldn even exist it ten minute short film with ninety five minutes of filler if you were to show me sleepless in seattle and didn have to review it you could just call me asleep in philadelphia 1999 eugene novikov&#137
marie couldn talk paulie the parrot star of his own movie tells us about the daughter in his original family dad couldn listen and mom couldn cope so they got rid of me paulie the autobiography of talking not merely mimicking parrot has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird the voice not the body and as the minor character of benny small time crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms as the parrot mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up benny on the other hand is character you ve seen thousand times before and mohr brings nothing new to that role roberts deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig script lends subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems when kids movie wants to mosey along watch out if the material is not crisp and perfectly composed beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium so it is with paulie when they let their bird do his stand up comedy routines the show hums and the audience roars too often however sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they wait for the story to pickup again tony shalhoub the smart mouthed chef from big night plays misha recent russian immigrant to the he had been teacher of literature at home but now he makes his living as janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study although misha gets few nice lines russian like long stories his somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy besides paulie the only character worth noting other than cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands is the speech impaired marie played in precious performance by cinematic newcomer year old hallie kate eisenberg naturally enchanting she gives the picture genuine heart the bad news is that her part is confined to the first half the best scenes have the bird dancing and strutting to show off his comedic skills when marie family gets cat for example the bird who hasn wanted to learn how to fly until then takes an instant interest in soaring tricking the cat while insulting him at the same time paulie calls him stupid hairball their rapid physical antics add to the humor of the situation it good quality sitcom material but performed by animals when one of the humans without much of voice begins to sing paulie cringes bird he explains with his frequently subtle humor have small brain and it about to explode the movie contains rich doses of john debney dreamy music with heavy use of solo violin he keeps reinforcing the film heart warming themes and when paulie finally takes off in flight the orchestra comes up loud and strong with cymbals clashing it long story says paulie it the only kind he knows reflects misha and the motion picture which runs the standard length for kids movie still feels too long the best parts are enthralling but then there are all of those dead spots in between paulie is movie that never quite lives up to its promise but manages to charm nevertheless paulie runs 32 it is raged pg for few mild profanities and would be fine for all ages my son jeffrey age gave the movie with his biggest complaint being that there wasn enough action he thought paulie was funny and the actress that played marie was quite good his friend sam almost thought the movie was awesome excellent and gave it he thought paulie was good but he didn believe the way marie speech impediment was acted
these days we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old cult tv shows most of the times the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past but some five or six years ago there weren that many movies and the trend didn look that depressing so the people who like the author of this review grew up watching flintstones popular 1960s animated series about modern stone age family weren particularly worried when the word came about live action remake after all the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and if anything else at least the special effects would be good the plot revolves about flintstones family set in fictious stone age town of bedrock whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america fred flinstone john goodman works in the quarry and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble rick moranis and his wife betty rosie donnell to adopt baby to return the favour barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred and based on that fred gets well paid job in management but of course this is just sham corrupt official cliff vandercave kyle maclachlan and his sultry secretary sharon stone halle berry need scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme in the meantime fred wife wilma elizabeth perkins must face her mother elizabeth taylor who can stand fred on the superficial level the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life computer effects are flawless and the costumes settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show unfortunately problems with this film start with inadequate casting rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie donnell but the greatest problem of all is plot or to be precise the lack of plot some thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame original characters one dimensional and many elements of the story like embezzlement and inter office politics totally incomprehensible for the little children the main targeted audience of this film result is almost unwatchable mess occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as high concept after great hype movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version all in all film isn that bad but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it
one of the 90s most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave it the ___ from hell movie starting in the early nineties we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationships from hell there were boyfriends from hell friendly neighborhood cops from hell nannies from hell and even secretaries from hell but hush has found an old standby that somehow was forgotten in the rush the mother in law from hell the mother in law in question is martha played by jessica lange she has been single handedly running the family horse farm kilronan her son jackson johnathon schaech and his girlfriend helen gwyneth paltrow live in new york and have no intention to move back down south to the rural kilronan but those intentions are about to change you see martha lives by manipulation she has used it in years past to breed many championship horses now she believes she can use it to breed herself grandson though at first helen finds martha charming soon she is caught in the domineering martha web of deception it hard to understand why nobody ever wises up to martha schemes as written most of the characters in the film must be very slow witted but then the film even treats the audience like idiots it tries to get away with things like leaving critical piece of evidence in rather unlikely place without even batting an eye then again an audience which accepts characters as shallow as these isn one that likely to question details jessica lange martha is the only semi developed character in the film and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can character that could have been simply awful is merely groan worthy gwyneth paltrow doesn have much to build upon as helen only character trait seems to be daughter in law still she fares better than johnathon schaech whose character is so nonexistent he inexplicably missing for much of the film still there have been much worse ____ from hell films even with its paper thin characters and ludicrous setups hush manages to create few thrills in color by numbers fashion you know what coming but occasionally the film will deliver shock or two the old formulas are around for reason but that doesn mean they taste fresh
america sweethearts has an intriguing premise and great cast but it isn nearly as edgy or funny as it should be almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co script writer billy crystal who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co hosting comic relief charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg two other paragons of self indulgence crystal ignores simple but crucial rule for screwball comedy to work the characters must be placed into rigid social setting because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous america sweethearts takes place at press junket where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters it promising set up but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules thus dissipating the tension of the situation by the end of the film all the lead performers participate in huge fight with room full of journalists looking on but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed john cusack and catherine zeta jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector hank azaria spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together six crossed the $100 million mark but the prospects for their final effort space opus titled time over time are far from rosy while eddie has spent many months in new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup gwen solo films have tanked to make matter worse the director of the movie christopher walken visionary who purchased the unabomber cabin and had it moved to his backyard is withholding the film from the studio insisting that the first screening be held at the junket desperate to win over the press the studio elects to hire lee billy crystal recently fired publicist to salvage the situation lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation he enlists the help of kiki julia roberts gwen sister personal assistant and whipping girl what lee doesn know is that kiki is in love with eddie fact that could temper her effectiveness press junkets are haven for control freaks studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in plush hotel with food and drink always at hand generally on the evening of their arrival writers are bussed to see the featured film then ferreted straight back to the hotel the next day writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews every 30 minutes or so producer director writer or actor is brought into the room for few minutes of questions with publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression writers are free to ask what they want but understand that if the studio dislikes question they may not be invited to future junkets representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew with the studio filming the exchanges the reporters are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars but to play it safe the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs placing two spoiled actors in setting where image is everything is inspired but the screenplay undermines the conceit the junket is moved from the handsome but highly confining four seasons hotel to plush resort near las vegas for most of the film the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds completely safe from the eyes of the press when they do deal with journalists the it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters premise is de clawed gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll they scream at each other in restaurant filled with the media and at the screening of the movie everyone connected with the film goes nuts all without any repercussions lee certainly isn bothered by any of the infantile outbursts in fact he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors hell no they feel lee is genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie all of which underscores how billy crystal and co writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise the comedy in america sweethearts is based on barely in control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters except that it doesn matter because any publicity is good publicity and thus the very set up for the film implodes leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter so what about the cast julia roberts at her best playing the underdog is utterly charming here although could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in fat suit and not very convincing one by the way catherine zeta jones makes believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic by casting himself as the publicist billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on comic relief stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks in supporting roles hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed too broad seth green is amusing as toadie stanley tucci is very good as ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair though he has little to work with come to think of it little to work with is the operative phrase for this movie as hollywood satire america sweethearts is toothless as romance it is at best minor pleasure such good cast such waste of their efforts had it not been taken long ago better title for the film would have been much ado about nothing
synopsis two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry woody harrelson an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into post tries to slap girl and gets poked in the eye has ill timed fits of coughing and fails at everything he does the story is told from harry point of view harry always carries around shot of whiskey although he swears he doesn drink one day harry is approached by the con girl rhea elisabeth shue who is similar to harry in that she carries around cigarette but swears she doesn smoke seduced harry agrees to participate in money making scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette chloe sevigny the teenage daughter of rich man turns out it all part of needless very puzzling extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme it involves hiring special impersonators by two cons in order to fool harry hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of wooden post when the kidnapped odette is found dead the clues point to harry as the kidnapper murderer and the police are hot on harry trail harry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money can he get out of this mess opinion palmetto is long uninteresting film with all the wrong feel hero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence this farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof but palmetto is played like dark serious detective noir drama and watching harry bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction there lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts buttocks short skirts colored painted nails and women legs even when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema you can always notice the side of elizabeth shue breast forming prominent foreground towards the end palmetto re focuses on plot for the grand finale confusing explanation involving impersonators with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over tub of acid as he hears the criminals confession if you can imagine shemp from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo lingerie suspense thriller that how out of synch this movie feels
how do you judge film that is so bad but intentionally so in spiceworld the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal mocking themselves with purposely cheezy film and having lot of fun doing it if that was their goal they did fantastic job so is it fair to give it such low grade when it wasn really meant to be much better than this honestly rather see this film before many others gave higher grades so does that mean graded it inaccurately truth be known don really think can answer this question to understand spiceworld you have to understand the spice girls unless you re very very young or fairly older you probably have at least heard of them they re group of five busty british babes who ve had #1 hit singles and whose debut album sold millions they re primarily adored by pre teen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spice real name geri haliwell wonderbra all five of the girls have these spicy names for which they are better known than their real names there is the aforementioned ginger spice as well as sporty spice melanie chisholm or mel scary spice melanie brown or mel baby spice emma bunton and posh spice victoria addams and all of them to some degree or another resemble their stage names the spice girls took the world by storm and spiceworld is actually good humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame it quite nice to see what good sports the girls are and not just the one dubbed sporty about poking fun at themselves they don take themselves too seriously and that probably the best thing about them it also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera acting and not just singing and dancing they re not flawless by any means but for the most part they deliver their lines without feeling staged and like them or not we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters which seems reasonable since they portray themselves what makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls won get enough of their music while the rest of us don get enough of movie the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes most of the film is very blas but several parts are downright boring and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud if you re big fan of the group you probably won get enough of what you want and if you re not big fan you get too much time devoted to nothing more than look at us moments for the right crowd the music video sequences will be the highlights of the film but for others they will serve as three minute lulls in hectic but overall uneventful storyline other key actors include richard grant as clifford the spice girls manager alan cumming as the film maker piers cutherton smyth who attempts to make documentary of the group george wendt as martin barnfield producer who constantly works on pitching spice girls movie and roger moore in small self parodizing role all provide relatively good performances keeping in mind once again that this film wasn meant to be acted seriously even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it while this film is continuously compared to the beatles hard day night think that is an unjust comparison it is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison by way of press kits but don think drector bob spiers nor the spice girls intended it to be so think the studios were just trying to boost hype and interest in the film and have instead come off rather pretentious don think this film is trying to be anything more than fun satirical look at group that got so big movie seemed the next likely step and what could ve been better than self indulged yet self mocking approach probably nothing and so it is spiceworld is movie thought would be embarrassing to enjoy but now instead find myself wanting to defend movie didn even give good review it bad but it succeeds in every way it intended it gives the spice girls chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment perhaps the group is nothing more than gimmick if that the case the movie gimmick is that it is such gimmick you might be saying spice girls movie come on but when it comes down to it think that the point
when was nine started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what was after for action figures they combined science fiction and fantasy had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read of course the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history given the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon not to mention its moderately successful spin off she ra princess of power it was inevitable that production company would put two and two together come with the result of trillions and make live action masters movie let be blunt masters of the universe is very bad movie the story is painfully dull and mind numbingly cliched hands up who wouldn guess he man and skeletor take their fight into the real world and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors dolph lundgren as he man for one or good actors james tolkan meg foster given such awful characters and dialogue that they can help but seem terrible it is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars we have the alien bounty hunters the desert skif technology stormtrooper lookalikes and musical score so reminiscent of john williams that deja vu is too polite term to use in describing it blatant uninspired ripoff would appear more appropriate tv fans might want to check out courtney cox monica in friends and robert duncan mcneill lt paris in star trek voyager very early in their careers and not doing to well in them either so in the face of such mindless sub mediocrity is there anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all yes there is one incredible good reason his name is frank langella langella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood appearing in countless films over the years here he plays skeletor the villain of the piece dressed in opulent siyah velvet robes and bearing skull for face he is one part darth vader one part emperor and two parts grim reaper given this character langella falls right into it with style and precision skeletor is believable interesting and manages to tread the fine line between being homage to the past and startlingly original in his own right masters of the universe remember loving it when was eleven at twenty one it difficult to see why but as said it is blessed with superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder besides this year marks the film 10th anniversary watch it with some friends for good laugh and celebrate
talk about beating dead horse when home alone was released in 1990 it was breath of fresh air and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated genuinely funny family film the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed sequel so two years later we were subjected to home alone which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited for john hughes two home alone movies weren enough he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with including pathetic box office bomb called baby day out last year live action 101 dalmatians and this year flubber now inexplicably hughes has exhumed not only these worn out plot elements but the home alone name as well the result 1997 worst sequel edging out speed and batman and robin home alone by changing the characters hughes who wrote and co produced the film along with his co conspirator director raja gosnell has attempted to inject new life into series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest the new kid alex pruitt is played by alex linz one fine day and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness he not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was the villains pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber in home alone there are four of them olek krupa david thornton lenny von dohlen and rya kihlstedt but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls this time the kid isn left home alone because his parents have gone on trip instead he has developed bad case of chicken pox so he can go to school his dad kevin kilner is away on business and his mom haviland morris has to run errands so for the most part he all by himself during the day through series of coincidences too irritating to relate top secret air force integrated circuit comes into his possession it wanted by gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex home to retrieve it the eight year old who is wise beyond his years booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains the movie climax takes place during raging snowstorm only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable previously the most counterfeit looking snow effects can remember were in star trek iii these are far worse in fact the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near blizzard when shining sun can be seen if it wonderful life could generate real looking snow back in the 1940s why can home alone which has significantly larger budget and 90s technology at its disposal there has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live action cartoon violence for young children home alone will add fuel to the fire it one thing to see wyle coyote flattened by 10 ton acme weight but quite another to watch running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen adults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous but what about five and six year olds the level of violence in home alone is extreme many of alex schemes are nasty enough to kill but because this is family film no one dies despite being electrocuted falling thirty feet and getting smacked on the head by barbell not only is home alone unnecessary but it offensive it an exercise in tediousness and there isn genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end unless by some strange quirk of fate you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes and thus haven seen this stuff before can imagine anyone with reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure maybe that why the only ones laughing at the screening attended were still in their thumb sucking years
in 1970s many european intellectuals especially those on the left political hemisphere became obsessed with the rise of fascism which wasn so hard to expect because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies in such times when political involvement could be associated with noble passion many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre war europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany of course there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other less noble reasons for them moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era which naturally made some of those films very popular among teen audience one of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass who later made career shooting expensive stylish soft porn salon kitty his 1976 film is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2 in 1939 walter schellenberg one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats none of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents and that all the rooms happened to be bugged the most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty nominal madame of the brothel didn know the real purpose of that enterprise screenplay by tinto brass of course simplifies the story and changes few names schellenberg is now wallenberg helmut berger ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top kitty kellerman ingrid thulin apart from being madam has second job as cabaret singer caught in the net of depravity is sweet innocent girl margerithe theresa ann savoy thrown into brothel there she falls in love with customer hans reiter bekim fehmiu disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe when margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel she finds out that the place is bugged she informs the madam of the real situation and both women decide to confront wallenberg those who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation but although salon kitty doesn happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn although not very successful some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict this time between power hungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty unfortunately brass seems to overuse other cinematical references probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino visconti the damned but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulin unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minelli musical numbers from cabaret all in all salon kitty is failure although with some very interesting moments
capsule godawful comedy that amazingly shabby and cut rate and rather bereft of laughs was having bad week in my life when saw austin powers international man of mystery desperately needed something to cheer me up or at least distract me so could get clear head get some perspective even dumb movies can do that for me sometimes tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment but am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day won the lottery michael myers has taken character that would barely have supported five minute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of feature film padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of props strategically positioned between naked actors and camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago the plot what little there is of it back in the swinging mod hep sixties don think doing disservice to the movie attempted early look and feel by describing it that way sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr evil evil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later when powers was out of the picture powers also had himself frozen and he wakes up to find the nineties very hard time to deal with the basic gag that of powers total inability to cope with the nineties is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with the bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics james bond gags of which this movie has no end right down to the silly character names inept slapstick toilet humor and strategically placed props the movie amazingly bereft of ideas come to think of it with couple of bright exceptions one is dr evil son there is sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group chaired by carrie fisher and the other is throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind couch it visual gag hard to describe and hard to recommend seeing the movie for lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie but it desperate rather than clever instead of skewering the whole thing it rather bloodless and unfunny tribute myers himself is also desperate he given an idea to play not character plus the attempts to make the character work by giving him relationship with another sexy albeit nineties agent are waste of time wanted to have the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her only to have her deck him one with couple of exceptions the movie misses all of its own best moments the movie even looks cheesy and not in good way kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hi def video or something so grainy was the film stock in good many scenes the whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap my definition of comedy is simply did it make me laugh the few times that laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time spent cringing and wanting out the most damning thing could say about the movie is that wayne and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tyson shorts and sent it sailing
weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg reliance on formulas _saving private ryan_ is mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches there ought to be law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics spielberg greatest strength as director is the polished formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make perfect story but for topic of such weight as combat in the second world war or the holocaust this technique backfires for it creates coherent comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films _saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on pr mission to pull young man ryan whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere out of combat on the normandy front just after day ryan is paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france there no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making great war movie the equipment uniforms and weapons are superbly done the opening sequence in which captain miller tom hanks leads his men onto omaha beach is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers the banality of death in combat the routine foul ups in the execution of the war and the cynicism of the troops the technical side of the film is peerless as always the camera work is magnificent the pacing perfect the sets convincing the directing without flaw hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance which was utterly convincing and the supporting cast was excellent though ted danson seems mite out of place as paratroop colonel yet the attempt at realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film or the story fails to convince throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices exception men are shown burning to death with relative frequency for example we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground here and there men lose limbs in one scene miller is pulling man to safety there an explosion and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half man but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact there are no shoes with only feet in them no limbs scattered everywhere no torsos without limbs no charred corpses and most importantly all corpses have heads in fairness there are smattering of wicked head wounds the relentless dehumanization of the war in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity is soft pedaled in the film ultimately _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war rather than saying _saving private ryan_ is realistic it would be better to describe it as having realistic moments another aspect of the hollywoodization of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular the lack of swearing anyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war such as fussell superb _wartime understanding and behavior in the second world war_ which has an extensive discussion on swearing knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup who is this private ryan that we have to die for him asks one infantrymen in the group of eight rendered in wartime demotic that should have been expressed as who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him or some variant thereof conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the word and largely about the search for food and sex this is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an rating due to violence so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it family film however the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg he cannot just cede control to the material he has to be bigger than it as if afraid to let the viewer find their own perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear emotional foothold in the material spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war meaning and coherence it never had the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler list the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close every bit as bad as schindler monologue about how his car tiepin or ring could have saved another jew quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson captain miller last words to private ryan and an unbelievable storyline in which prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain that particular subplot is so hokey so predictable it nigh on ruins the film nowhere in the film is there resolute depiction of the meaninglessness stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage because of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows
it seems that ve stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch take payback for example movie that most people seem to like however it horrible schlock straight out of hollywood vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies it was written and directed by guy who should have done better however maybe he did do better after all 30 percent of the movie isn his own mel gibson that hollywood zombie decided he didn like the ending and had another director reshoot it what crock if you sign on to do movie then do it the way the script calls for why film movie and then look at it later and say no changed my mind don like the ending you re fired let get someone else to do it suppose honor is dead in hollywood the end of the film is of course hollywoodized which is to say that it happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize in this case as is most victories in hollywood movies gibson prize is blond and money miss originality in film really do think audiences are so starved for it that they ll flop down lot of money in hopes that movie will be original payback tagline get ready to root for the bad guy promised an original idea but it was far from the truth while gibson character certainly broke the law he was character that had honor odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it wouldn kill in front of children and protects his blond woman there nothing bad about him he hollywood character person who could never exist in real life and gibson knows it he spends his time trying to act like bad guy and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant the story involves gibson being double crossed by his partner who is real bad guy which made me wish that we could root for him over $70 000 gibson recovers from multiple gunshots is pissed naturally and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back no more no less he makes point of it that it strictly 70 grand real bad guy would have made his ex partner pay 25% interest this idea is completely stretched out gibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with what didn understand this is the chicago mafia $70 000 is like spare change to them they probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him think they respect guy going through this much trouble for simple $70 000 maybe being too hard on the movie perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make simple popcorn movie read roger ebert review and he liked gibson in the role because he is comic at heart playing bad guy that why we re allowed to root for him and it true gibson walks the movie as if he smiling at joke he just heard but he wrong here wanted lee marvin or old time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn comic just an ass kicker as side note ve just checked the internet movie database and discovered that am the 38th person to post newsgroup review of payback after this many reviews why would anyone want to read this really don care just trying to gain membership into the on line film critics society by posting as many reviews as can
this is one of the worst big screen film experiences ve had for while with this film plus `showgirls and `basic instinct paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors his celebrated film `total recall was admit successfully scripted but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws obviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in production from someone like verhoeven the result being that much of the special effects in `starship seemed fake but not everything bad in the film was the director fault even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors it is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards expected five for the acting categories casserole vanity devoid dense ribald dingy miasma and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school no they have to pass primary school drama classes first while `total was written well `starship is purely pathetic all right it is supposed to be fast paced entertainment film and you re supposed to turn off your intellect completely and enjoy the action sequences and special effects that is guts and gore as matter of fact found the activity incredibly boring complete waste of more than two hours half of the film was bad episode of `beverly hills 90210 dina meyer was in beverly hills while another quarter was simply nothing things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web and the rest was display of humans fighting computer generated images the battles were all the same jumping around shoot or get stabbed and on barren planets that only had giant insects there weren even any stunts which consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around wonder what the insects eat if there nothing but them on the planets there is so much laughable treatment in this film and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended this type of story is obviously aimed at 10 year olds who can see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality but then there are always 16 year olds who have that frame of mind the pointless plot begins when johnny vanity devoid girlfriend carmen richards decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth johnny then signs up as trooper also after an overacted argument with his parents but there is another girl dizzy meyer who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen which results in love quadrangle which isn better because it means augmented worse than stereotyped soap opera increased bitchiness and more bad beverly hills melrose and the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid anyway getting back to the thing you might call plot johnny is too stupid to be pilot and has to join the infantry while his girl and the other dude are in the same league dizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also they then start training which contains what roger ebert calls ips idiot plot syndrome moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes then real combat and guess what that about as complex as it gets oh and one of their friends carl neil patrick harris doogie howser becomes involved in war intelligence and his abilities at the end are really corny and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it he my fifth nom for razzie the troopers fight fall in love die kill and try to act naturally they win or sort of half win of course in between and at the end there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs the bugs also suffer from ips why would you release hold of your captive before killing it isn it also amazing that earthlings haven invented better hand held weapons by then the only question that remains is why gave it one star instead of zero well maybe quarter of star for the originality of the co sex shower scene and the very brief moments of suspense another quarter for copying `zulu and letting the good guys the bugs win and half star for the sucking out of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors but there should have been more the troopers deserved to die

in french the phrase film noir literally means siyah film webster defines it as type of crime film featuring cynical malevolent characters in sleazy setting and an ominous atmosphere that is conveyed by shadowy photography and foreboding background music classic film noir including such memorable fare as the big sleep the original cape fear and orson welles striking touch of evil employed siyah and beyaz photography to emphasize the long shadows associated with the genre color came into play with neo noir films like chinatown and blade runner confidential easily the best film of 1997 is wonderful piece of contemporary neo noir filmmaking for textbook example of how to take all the elements of neo noir and create an absolute mess there palmetto based on just another sucker short story written by british author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase palmetto shows what happens when filmmaker puts style ahead of substance director volker schlondorff tin drum the handmaid tale stated we weren even sure for long time if it was going to be thriller or comedy it shows palmetto is too preposterous too be taken seriously as thriller and too ponderous to work as comedy the story begins when journalist harry barber woody harrelson is released from prison someone turned state witness and revealed that harry was framed reward for blowing the lid on corruption in the small florida town of palmetto bitter and broke harry plans to hitchhike to miami and start his life over but ex girlfriend nina gina gershon appears to return him to palmetto while hanging out at bar he notices that beautiful woman has left her purse in phone booth harry pockets her cash only to have the woman reappear and catch him with her money in his pocket no problem though the radiant blonde is rhea malroux elisabeth shue the young wife of very rich older man with heart problems and she has proposition for harry rhea needs threatening voice and someone to collect the ransom for the staged kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter odette chloe sevigny the girls want to bilk half million dollar ransom from the old man and will happily give harry $50 000 for helping with the scam things go wrong of course odette is found dead leaving harry frantically trying to dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks in an ironic twist harry is asked to work for the local office they need press liaison to field questions about odette kidnapping and feel that harry is the perfect man for the job not bad set up for noir film if only schlondorff knew how to handle the material but he never settles on consistent tone the actors don know what to do with their characters either muddling the proceedings even further as if that wasn enough the story suffers from major problems in logic woody harrelson is talented actor with an admirable willingness to take on risky parts but he lost here presented as crusading journalist who was horribly wronged it makes no sense that harry would be stupid and dishonest enough to get caught up in this scheme harrelson clearly doesn know what to do with harry character so he spends most of the film glowering sweating and generally acting miserable meanwhile elisabeth shue gives goofy performance behaving like vamp on nitrous oxide as the stepdaughter chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks that she comes off like juliette lewis jr despite number of steamy scenes there no chemistry between harrelson and the women to make matters worse schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the character lips are running over each others bodies two particularly bad scenes highlight the film problems while driving with body in his trunk harry has minor car wreck and cop shows up the officer wants to help change harry flat tire and asks him to open the trunk harry pathetic attempts to keep the trunk closed might have worked if played as comedy but under schlondorff grim direction the scene is just embarrassing the film nadir comes when bad guy prepares to kill harry and nina we re supposed to be horrified watching our hero dangling over bathtub filled with acid but by this point the film has foundered so badly that the scene is merely reminiscent of when jessica and roger rabbit were suspended over vat of dip had palmetto been played with tongue firmly in cheek it might have been an entertaining shaggy dog story but under the harsh direction of schlondorff the film is just sluggish paint by numbers exercise in neo noir cluelessness avoid this nonsense and go see confidential instead
america favorite homicidal plaything takes wicked wife in bride of chucky and their unholy matrimony is something old nothing new the burning question on the minds of most moviegoers however has nothing to do with nuptial specifics or even how the movie stacks up but rather whether or not the duo gets down and dirty on their blood soaked honeymoon the answer is sick and twisted yes and viewers are treated to shadowy glimpse of some hot enough to melt rubber or at least singe it lovin guess they re anatomically correct chucky again voiced by brad dourif of course is the star of the child play series my buddy type doll possessed by the spirit of slain serial killer in bride the plot heh picks up with his girlfriend tiffany jennifer tilly resurrecting chucky remains he was blown up at the end of child play with the help of siyah arts manual called voodoo for dummies silly mortal before long she also been reduced to shin high figurine status and the plastic incarnations of these one time lunatic lovebirds hit the road to scope out some potential new human bodies the rest of this rocky horror puppet show plays out as tiff and the chuckster stalk young couple nick stabile and katherine heigl with conjugal plans of their own leading them towards new jersey grave where magical soul transferring amulet allegedly lies in wait along the way our murderous barbie and ken go through post marriage motions similar to any given pair of newlyweds bicker argue kiss and make up but when they squabble over who going to do the dishes watch out hey even faux people have got to work through their problems director ronny yu keeps the mayhem flashy and stages an inventive scene or two but not even visual flair can make up for the fact that these creepy kewpies are neither scary nor menacing when one of them charges it nothing good forward punt couldn take care of and when climactic chase scene is needed one of the dim bulb protagonists must _pick_chucky_up_ so the demonic toy can force his hostage to run at gunpoint throw in some silly casualties and ridiculous ending will son of chucky be next and this is bizarrely bad 89 minutes at the movies as is the thing to do in post scream slasher cinema don mancini screenplay slathers on the in jokes and genre parody but little of the humor succeeds proving self reference can be completely worthless when it lacks bite to be fair though most of bride of chucky is on auto pilot so it not quite right to single out one misfired aspect of the film similarly shaky the acting ranges from screeching camp to boring bland the effects aren that special and the story is one big groaner here hoping chucky and his entire clan past present and future rest in peace
this is the first film in what would become the most successful series of horror films of all time fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyone favorite goalie mask wearing homicidal maniac jason the guy who single handedly controlled the overpopulation problem around the crystal lake area doesn start his quest to find the most interesting household item with which to kill someone until the sequel while he does have small role in this film we the audience have to depend on another blood thirsty maniac to rack up the body count the plot like every other friday the 13th movie goes something like this crazed killer murders as many unsuspecting teenagers as he she it possibly can in the space of 90 minute movie the reasons that the afore mentioned unsuspecting teenagers come into contact with the bloodthirsty killer are usually of little importance to the story but for those of you out there that might actually care about such trivial matters in movie such as plot here are the basics bunch of unsuspecting teens get summer job at long closed summer camp they are days away from the arrival of the kids and they are spending their time fixing the place up and making sure it is ready for the kids sadly they start being butchered one by one by the bloodthirsty killer at this point would usually say something about the quality of acting directing or maybe something about the high quality of the production since not going to do that feel free to assume that if did it wouldn be positive will say that this movie looks as if it was made for about hundred bucks and that includes the actors salaries if you are used to recent horror films like scream you are in for bit of surprise the only saving grace for friday the 13th is that it was really the first of its kind with the killer taking real pride in their work using as many methods of murder as they could none of this single murder weapon stuff life that unimaginative leatherface in chainsaw massacre or the creatively stifled imagination of halloween michael myers who just used brute force or really big kitchen knife nope in the friday the 13th movies you can always count on the killer taking great pride in his work one fun fact about this movie is that the cast includes very young kevin bacon although after this movie it is wonder he ever worked again the main reason to see friday the 13th is if you want to watch all of the series from the beginning if not stick with the later films with jason everyone favorite hockey fan friday the 13th is the sort of movie that is fun to sit down and get couple of scares from just don sit down expecting whole lot
that is unless you re one of those people who have seen the preview thousand times on tv or in the theaters can tell you one thing now they gave the entire movie away why someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me however if they hadn given it away the film would ve still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter obviously the producers thought they could remake the deep end of the ocean throw in tommy lee jones and couple of cliches and call it an action drama double jeopardy offers solid acting from ashley judd and tommy lee jones who got first billing even though he didn see to be on screen half as much as judd did it also offers some genuinely funny clever or full of tension moments my favorite judd waking up in the coffin but none of that can salvage the film from its insanely predictable plot half the time wondering whether watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries which always turn out to be less exciting than advertised judging by the beginning end and huge chunk of the middle might have been watching special hallmark presentation too the movie stretching for an almost two hour long film with only 30 minutes worth of material implausible material no less loose interpretation of one of the amendments aside too many times in the movie thought that is not possible that kind of stuff is excusable in popcorn movies but not one like double jeopardy that tries to pass itself off as serious drama everything seems dragged out overplayed when they should ve kept us in the dark they let the cat out of the bag too early
capsule the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith films gets their own movie the gags are sporadically funny it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti gay jokes the plot is weak and the leads are not particularly funny comic team the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night and it turns out he had very good reasons low to +4 film needs plot it needs characters for empathy value it needs story and an emotional center if film is just chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are kevin smith has now made two satisfying films clerks and chasing amy with dogma he tried to make philosophical religious comedy and mixed with madcap romp peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it his remaining two films mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at teenage audience jay and silent bob strike back is compendium of gay jokes penis jokes flatulence jokes film pastiches and in jokes how funny the jokes are will be subjective call for me the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny there was not enough cleverness or variety it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay penis jokes work only so many times showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were clever pair of human running gags they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post war films including dead of night the lady vanishes and passport to pimlico jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation stoners as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads jay and silent bob played by jason mewes and kevin smith are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks this leaves them at loose ends they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into movie they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny silent bob being silent can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his this makes his piece of the comedy even less than straight man like dean martin or bud abbott would have jay has to be the comic he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair so jay and silent bob are long way from being successful comic team their starring roles and the low humor make this comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before sometimes just minutes before like dogma before it but definitely not like chasing amy this film feels more like an amateurish skit than real movie certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving they are excuses for gags many of which still fall flat it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content the film does not offer much to an adult audience rate it on the to 10 scale and low on the to +4 scale
claire danes giovanni ribisi and omar epps make likable trio of protagonists but they re just about the only palatable element of the mod squad lame brained big screen version of the 70s tv show the story has all the originality of block of wood well it would if you could decipher it the characters are all blank slates and scott silver perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come by sheer force of talent the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they re on screen but the mod squad is just second rate action picture with first rate cast
for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking or what left of it in mainstream hollywood movie which are star vehicles are terrible things as rule the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of particular actor an actor might be chosen on the up and up to give him exposure or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him paycheck generally though the actor doesn matter and soldier the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers exemplifies this the picture lacks pizazz the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less russell plays todd human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought the movie lets us see this degenerate process but by the time the real plot starts we re into todd later years he about to be replaced by new breed of soldiers ones who instead of being trained from birth are genetically selected before birth the pride of this class caine 607 jason scott lee will be our villain and you know he the villain because he has staring contest with our hero near the movie start between the two leads less than full typed page of dialogue is spoken and it possible to imagine script which is ninety percent stage direction director paul anderson who helmed last year icy thriller event horizon doesn show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam todd upon being replaced is left to die on garbage planet but in order to stretch the running time out the villains return to the garbage planet on routine patrol and set the stage for the final firefight events are predictable from the time that the setups are made and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be todd fails to show physical superiority against caine in fact not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry it not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story and so the plot has very canned feeling about it the best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit and treat it as parody of typical action fare like universal soldier strict interpretation however reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style class or substance and by next year large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television
what would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in movie better question what would inspire studio to produce said movie if you have an answer let me know foolish the new movie written by and starring master is jaw droppingly horrible film one with no redeeming value socially cinematically or otherwise comedically it has some potential but only in its stand up comedy moments which can turn on comedy central for master stars as fifty dollah beat that as mobster think who is trying to start comedy club act with his little brother foolish eddie griffin but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss played by andrew dice clay for the very first time entertaining stubborn club owner and family problems the latter in foolish is perfect example of roger ebert idiot plot if everyone here wasn an idiot there would be no problem so what does foolish have to offer beside bunch of idiotic character names not hell of lot as have mentioned master cannot act or write he acts like the rapper that he is the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro as for his script well suppose he delivers what one would expect from musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience if you haven yet figured it out that is not saying much co star eddie griffin really the star of the show is quite different story the fact of the matter is that griffin whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network is an extremely talented comedian stand up and otherwise he has much in common with chris tucker rush hour money talks in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity to the extent which that can be done and while hope that does not become his trademark it works in few scenes in this movie and indeed laughed at few stand up scenes here but from feature length movie expect more foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either stupid joke in scene where tension escalates between the two brothers foolish blurts out towards his jewelry sporting sibling you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be altin rush or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car to which said bit too loudly for the occasion huh after getting slightly upset with his wife believe me when say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard earned $8 you ll get more laughs from watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you don have cable eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative although offensive yarn but everyone else should stay the hell away &#137
there re so many things to criticize about don know where to start recommendation turn off your brain don be like me decreasing the rating everyday because think about it too much comet is about to strike earth causing catastrophe similar to the extinction level event that wiped out the dinosaurs what follows is the story of president bid to think for the good of his people rising reporter the love story of two teenagers one of whom discovered the comet and team of astronauts on the ship `messiah to save the world firstly there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film nor is there anything outstandingly good about it but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid to be honest was more moved by the trailer than the film itself which isn saying much mimi leder follow up to `the peacemaker is equally incompetent with all the big stars wasted perhaps just annoyed that the release of `the peacemaker in the us overshadowed far superior thriller `the assignment it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives however the film simply fails on that note the effects are worn out the substandard screenplay limited the acting and the director continued her sad run in terms of good film making credentials she still making good money though leoni unfortunate character the news reporter is the foundation of the story and of the cast but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored robert duvall aging astronaut is lifeless and morgan freeman president is restricted to well righteous president which means he not interesting at all leoni character is the only appealing one and is played with reasonable conviction but rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters warning spoilers included but lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway plot holes plot holes plot holes now is threatening to exterminate more than 99% of the human race and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there where the logic leder could have at least made it plausible with 20 and then it turns out that only few percent of the world population actually perish and those less selfish ones the ones that stayed at home were the victims the film was almost mocking them telling them they had died for nothing also fail to see how two teenagers carrying baby would be the first to climb up the mountain hill even with motorbike for head start it unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle but that doesn really matter building caves was strategy mentioned in `dr strangelove which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years now that is more practical use for caves what is the point of living in caves there is no unlike `dr strangelove any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure how do plants grow if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves there no reason why they can do it in the open the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves obviously this means that the other countries were informed long time ago and you can be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media in an important mission like that of the `messiah for that matter any mission it is impossible that isn sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres needless to say tens of kilometres this is not deep impact it frivolous cheap impact but even with all that some overacting and rating it still watchable just don think about it okay
everybody in this film thinking of alicia no this is not documentary on those of us after we first saw the cryin video this is one of those erotic thrillers but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed first off there zero sex almost no nudity and it not as well plotted as one of those tweed flicks well anyway the plot alicia plays well the babysitter who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents walsh and lee garlington go out to party the film trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers shows every characters thoughts except alicia the thing is alicia in most of them in most cases and the thoughts aren too kosher first off there her boyfriend jeremy london who gave one of the all time lousy performances in mallrats and is only notch better here who dorky kid who hangs out with kind of bully played by nicky katt from suburbia who shows he got that quiet creepiness down pat once again they decide they want to crash her babysitting job looking for the typical babysitting hanky panky somethine like that the film intercuts between the subplots alicia babysitting nicky and jeremy the party and each characters thoughts we get to see jeremy and nicky dreams of doing little threeway with alicia thinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub she has it all covered up the little tease and worst of all lee garlington dreaming of that hunk george segal it even shows them in bed together yea so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed though guess used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in flirting with disaster the ending is some kind of big tragedy thing but come on like we care about any of the characters the only interesting one is alicia mainly because she alicia and we mostly see her in the fantasies so guess she some kind of mystery or something but she is never explored further so basically this film is just series of mastabatory images sometimes featuring non nude alicia once again sadly sometimes featuring scantily clad george segal once again sadly watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night and let me tell you it is the only way to watch this film mean there reason they put these kinds of films on late at night they re just as good as sleeping pills and this one is one big fat waste of time even for an alicia film
ex universal soldier luc has to battle group of newer model engineered fighters gone bad the review jean claude van damme has one liner early on in universal soldier the return his latest attempt to remain relevant that sums up this entire movie he says been there done that no film critic could possibly sum up van damme recent film choices any better while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him martial arts and guns this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world with legionnaire never seeing the inside of multiplex he joins fellow martial artist action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away universal soldier the return is truly poor the plot is complete copy of several action films from this decade specifically terminator judgement day and the similarly named soldier soldier kurt russell was an older model super soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors for the good of planet schwarzenegger terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from newer model killing machine the 1000 and jean claude former universal soldier has to save the planet from the rampage of group of you guessed it newer model soldiers considering the poor box office performance of soldier it amazing that this project was ever given the go ahead luc devereaux van damme was the sole remaining universal soldier or unisol for short until he was returned to normal if muscular human form in this sequel technically the fourth film in the series following two straight to video duds that were ignored here plot wise luc is now human trainer consultant of sorts for the unisol program working with dylan cotner xander berkeley who interestingly also appeared in t2 the unisol program has engineered tougher fiercer fighting force with the help of super computer seth unfortunately upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government seth takes control of his soldiers killing everyone in the building except for luc his partner maggie his daughter hillary and erin reporter trapped inside the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive while beating up group of near indestructible soldiers most notably romeo popular wrestler goldberg there are lots of fights gun battles lame plot developments and noticeable lack of plausibility there are so many clich in this film that it is almost painful to watch luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on and in the course of single night they go from bickering to falling for each other to kissing erin is pathetically written character people are getting brutally gunned down all around her and yet not only does this not seem to frighten her but she finds time to remind luc that she isn leaving without her story whatever other laughable moments include luc going to strip club to get internet access what and group of rangers who after having been given good advice luc tells them that their weapons are useless and shows them specific gun which should work better choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway guess who wins the battle not one single scene in universal soldier the return has any originality to it when fuelled by don davis loud driving music score the film many fights become almost passable but mostly are full of the same ol jean claude moves director mic rodgers former stunt co ordinator keeps the action coming at rapid pace with only few token serious moments to be found his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion if only jean claude weren getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li rodgers could probably have made decent action film to place the blame squarely at van damme feet however is an injustice not sure that anyone not even robert deniro or edward norton could make writers william malone and john fasano script sound good one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access he cringes looks down and mutters uh uhm they all do saw it on 60 minutes eh he he he the script and indeed the entire film only saving grace is goldberg he chews up every scene he is in obviously enjoying his role immensely he even gives the film few laughs as he mutters things like really don like that guy every time he fails to kill luc sadly his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier the return into anything better than below average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight to video
synopsis maniac crazed by virulent microphage slaughters more than twenty people including street gang and heavily armed troops with small knife even with handgun however he can take out the two cops who are after him despite having shot one of them total of seven times comments the most notable aspect of adrenalin fear the rush is that it marks striking career move for natasha henstridge not only does she manage to keep all her clothes on her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans but welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles though admit it doesn show in this mess henstridge just like every other actor in the film delivers wooden performance in this monumental turkey the cast also includes christopher lambert who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films how on earth this movie got two big name stars to appear in it is beyond me adrenalin fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future 2007 boston has changed dramatically in those ten years it is now home to bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with policia printed on their doors some guy has really bad virus and he killing people because of it so the brave good guys lambert and henstridge go after him that it 76 minutes never seemed so long this is drawn out chase scene through dimly lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie the plot development is nil we learn absolutely nothing about lambert character and very little about henstridge character the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor tunnel airduct next and who will carry the flashlight subplot does exist involving henstridge character illegal attempt to get her son out of boston in her opening monologue monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure fake passport for her son twenty minutes into the film wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot in defining scene of the movie however changed my mind this fake passport drops to the ground lambert cop immediately recognizes it as fraud from six feet away must not have been good fake this emphasizes another fault with the film things just defy common sense lambert cop for instance is shot seven times yet he is still able to talk and slide about adrenalin fear the rush ends in trite manner that doesn seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for found myself rather bored with this film which will disappoint both sci fi horror fans and fans of henstridge and lambert don fear the rush fear the movie watch something else

while watching loser it occurred to me that amy heckerling true genius as film maker is casting in fast times at ridgemont high she gave us sean penn jeff spicoli in look who talking she turned bruce willis into wise cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival in clueless she found star vehicle for the adorableness that is or was alicia silverstone she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws unfortunately she may also be starting to understand that she understands giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies giving appealing actors script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser naturally heckerling makes her protagonist an all around swell guy paul tannek jason biggs is small town boy who gets scholarship to nyu then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold hearted big city paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman his roommates adam zak orth chris tom sadoski and noah jimmi simpson are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar in this case the lovely dora diamond mena suvari dora has problems of her own including shortage of funds to pay her tuition and relationship with professor edward alcott greg kinnear that more than slightly one sided they re two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people so clearly they belong together even if paul is loser must confess that for while was suckered in by heckerling casting jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace suvari is coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence they re pleasant enough to watch and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren then it gradually becomes clear that there virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort in theory loser is romantic comedy but there is scarcely laugh to be found in the entire film notable exception cameo by scene stealing comic actor as video store clerk instead of taking any time to make the characters situations funny heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters situations pathetic she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless nor any of that film interest in lively plotting not surprisingly since clueless plot came via jane austen emma she simply turns the film into pity party since loser is film composed almost entirely of establishing character you might think that those characters would be interesting or at least slightly complicated instead you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there no reason to watch them paul isn just nice guy he flawless consequently he central character who does absolutely no growing his roommates aren just inconsiderate they re actively evil blackmailing professor alcott drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity bad name and professor alcott isn just manipulative he turns dora into his house slave dora unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser and even that isn explored in sufficient detail there more ambiguity in the 30 second snippet from alan cumming broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations it another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow don know comic still spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora that hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkel scarborough fair canticle instead of giving the sequence knowing wink reference to the graduate hint that paul is becoming an overly sensitive clich heckerling plays it deadly straight even in the scenes that scream for light comic touch and bit of poke at her protagonist foibles she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint clueless cher had her self absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness in loser amy heckerling shows leaden hand with material that demands friskiness her one show of wit involves naming paul dorm hunt hall after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall her gift with casting proved to be her curse loser may be crashing bore but gee aren those two kids swell
the disney stick to what you do best rule states that disney animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their hand at live action kids entertainment they will fail miserably this goes double for occasions when they try to make live action adaptation of popular cartoon remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations still trying to forget that rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget an insulting despicable and worst of all expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as viable children film it will bore anyone over five and should prove unbearable for adults even at its relatively skinny running time of 80 minutes it films like this that make me want to go to my local blockbuster and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects just as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor yet his career takes nosedive to hell with his role as john brown depressed security guard with big heart who hopes that one day he can become real policemen and help the people around him he dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush dr brenda bradford joely fisher but after few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer john breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr brenda father dr brenda has been working on gadget project which would make half man half machine super policeman to fight crime feeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject realizing his dream of becoming policeman now when he says go go gadget [insert name of gizmo here] he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks bang up bandits and mangle murderers in the meantime the evil claw rupert everett the man responsible for the murder of the good doctor father is building gadget of his own carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john brown worst nemesis claw has plans of world domination which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile voice of hughley to save humanity from his wrath state of the art effects fly at mad pace in this $90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up convincing atmosphere had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect what we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of meal all of the expensive amounts to nothing part of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie can kids really admire hero so goody two shoes that he screams hey you ran stop sign while hanging off the back bumper of quickly moving vehicle think that today children will respond better to somebody dashing someone ultra cool they probably receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see father figure kick butt in addition to the more complex complaints above there also the simple stuff inspector gadget is boring formulaic and achingly implausible there no feeling that the director really cares about his story more than any other film ve seen this year this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line there popular commercial for sprite but that irrelevant running in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects it consists of studio suits discussing fictitious thank god movie called death slug each executive gleefully presents different merchandise tie in slug taco slug on stick at the end one of them asks what about the movie another answers well we don have script yet but we can bang one out by friday they probably could have replaced death slug with inspector gadget this film contains the sort of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script it no coincidence that most good children entertainment these days comes from animation animated features take so long to maker that it becomes labor of love for the filmmakers and they put care and pride into their work these kinds of films are banged out quicker and good percentage turn out worthless sloppy and impersonal the studios are becoming factories and films their assembled products 1999 eugene novikov&#137
robin hood men in tights is another mel brooks produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit unfortunately robin hood men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles none of the fun acting of young frankenstein is devoid of the charm of spaceballs and is even lacking the good solid dialogue of history of the world it is in short one of the worst movies have seen mel brooks or anybody else produce the plot borrows heavily from the well received kevin costner movie of last year robin hood prince of thieves this is not surprising in and of itself and could have been used to great comic effect mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie mel brooks does not take advantage of this however and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air none of which connect and none of which are explained later on the movie scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice cary elwes of princess bride fame plays robin of loxley man who was captured in the crusades fighting with king richard he escapes and joining with man named achoo am sure you can see the obvious joke fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard which has been captured by evil prince john played by funny comic richard lewis he also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil sheriff of rottingham good adventure plot that is sadly unused elwes and lewis are both excellent comics but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating neither actor has any good words to work with and the lines simply aren funny nor believable perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter man playing macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone this particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas that really felt like leaving the theatre much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout and some left the theatre chuckles were few and far between and they mostly dealt with visual jokes such as an old beaten up horse from rent wreck then from any dialogue whatsoever scenes that could have been classics such as the archery contest are ruined by poor acting perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive the basic plot that robin has received key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian is not witty nor funny mel brooks as circumcision giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience not all jewish either the movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails the addition of blind man who stumbles around falling off cliffs walking into ledges and being general buffoon could have had some humorous potential but is also made terribly offensive the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard he is well worth waiting for if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue excruciating visual humor old puns ancient jokes and bad acting if you can don even bother watching this miserable film
salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets actors who demand such salaries might be greedy but in some instances they are quite justified because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation proof for that can be found even in the realm of low budget movies and one fine example is breakaway 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring in famous figure skater tonya harding face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie poster but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra attractive woman who works as courier for gangster one day she decides to retire but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that realising that her life suddenly became worthless myra starts running for her life followed by professional assassins terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities her acting leaves much to be desired on the other hand her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave films bad name martin sheen brother joe estevez whose character looks like he had entered from another movies set is the only bright spot of breakaway unfortunately he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding silver screen debut proved to be her last film
