synopsis mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves boy from potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy mother fledgling restauranteur unsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman favor he takes pictures of her and kills number of people in his way comments stalked is yet another in seemingly endless string of spurned psychos getting their revenge type movies which are stable category in the 1990s film industry both theatrical and direct to video their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they re typically inexpensive to produce no special effects no big name stars and serve as vehicles to flash nudity allowing them to frequent late night cable television stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect the psycho never actually has an affair on the contrary he rejected rather quickly the psycho typically is an ex lover ex wife or ex husband other than that stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable stalked does not provide much suspense though that is what it sets out to do interspersed throughout the opening credits for instance serious sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause man to stalk it implicitly implied that all stalkers are men while pictures of boy are shown on the screen after these credits snapshot of actor jay underwood appears the narrator states that this is the story of daryl gleason and tells the audience that he is the stalker of course really this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels if the movie was meant to be about daryl then it should have been called stalker not stalked okay so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts no guesswork required stalked proceeds then as it begins obvious obvious obvious the opening sequence contrived quite bit brings daryl and brooke the victim together daryl obsesses over brooke follows her around and tries to woo her ultimately rejected by her his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate these plans include the all time psycho in love cliche the murdered pet for some reason this genre films require dead pet to be found by the victim stalked stalked is no exception it cat this time found in the shower events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked where only one survives guess who it invariably always is and you ll guess the conclusion to this turkey stalked cast is uniformly adequate not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either jay underwood as the stalker turns toward melodrama bit too much he overdoes it in other words but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands maryam abo about the only actor close to being star here she played the bond chick in the living daylights is equally adequate as the stalked of the title even though she seems too ditzy at times to be strong independent business owner brooke abo needs to be ditzy however for the plot to proceed toward the end for example brooke has her suspicions about daryl to ensure he won use it as another excuse to see her brooke decides to return toolbox he had left at her place to his house does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers of course not she tries the door opens it and wanders around the house when daryl returns he enters the house of course so our heroine is in danger somehow even though her car is parked at the front of the house right by the front door daryl is oblivious to her presence inside the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character intelligence stalked receives two stars because even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring it is not so bad that it cannot be watched rated mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in strip bar it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are if you re in the mood for good suspense film though stake out something else
janeane garofalo in romantic comedy it was good idea couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker this is by the books movie that plods along on predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs it also jumps on the ever popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there too garofalo plays campaign aide to massacusetts senator jay sanders running for reelection denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that made the kennedy family so popular so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit she soon learns why easier said than done is the mantra of movies like this the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong garofalo has to take tiny plane to ireland almost misses the bus to town can get hotel room ends up in the smallest trashiest one around has dog piss on her luggage and so on then comes what roger ebert calls the meet cute it happens in every romance the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional cinematic way in the matchmaker it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds nude sean david hara in the bathtub his dog sitting at his side no points for guessing it the same dog that just made water on her luggage also no points for guessing garofalo hates hara on sight that how it works in movies like these know from the instant saw that irishman in the bathtub that she hate him for awhile then succumb to his charms live happily for reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil after which they reconcile in time for happy irish tune to play over the end credits haven mentioned the movie twist yet garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into future of bliss milo shea who looks like an irish tom snyder is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together rest assured he ll do all he can to match up garofalo and hara oh and in keeping with the matchmaker utter predictability he dies toward the end what the message here sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction like garofalo will sell out with weak script was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie but they actually only have two or three scenes together leary stays stateside for the most part yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole he even undoes himself with the old microphone still on after he done giving the speech cliche both of them should have known better
spawn features good guys bad guys lots of fighting bloody violence leather clad machine gun chick gooey self healing bullet holes scatological humor and man eating monster it not only appears to have been tailor made for swarm of 12 and 13 year old boys it appears to have been made by them in classic example of telling and not showing spawn opens with truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness forces of light and how men are the ones who create evil on earth so much for message the movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons michael jai beyaz government assassin operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn martin sheen who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip while on top secret mission in north korean biological weapons plant simmons goes to hell and back after making deal with satan himself if he agrees to command the devil army to overtake the world he ll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda underused theresa randle and little girl cyan sydni beaudoin of course seeing as how five years has passed wanda has fallen for and married simmons partner sweeney his uh shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown john leguizamo disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan clown manipulates simmons now in superhuman spawn form into stand off with wynn wynn who thinks he is in league with the double dealing clown recognizes spawn as threat and undergoes an operation where bomb is placed on his heart when it stops beating major cities around the world will detonate causing the leak of disease that makes the ebola virus look like skin rash phew got all that it would be easy to dismiss spawn as just another one of those heavy on fx short on substance action pics but it doesn even work on that level the computer generated sequences are often and plenty and the problem is that they look too computer generated the several scenes set in hell present devil that looks and acts like video game graphic with the movie healthy budget you think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks other elements of the movie are so so spawn enormous kirmizi flowing cape is wonderful sight but it too obvious when he being played by costumed actor or an image in movies like contact the special effects serve the story in spawn they are the story and spawn himself isn even an interesting character the film reliance on razzle dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for but both simmons and his funky alter ego are completely underdeveloped what we need is batman luke skywalker even watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn poor leguizamo he starred in february the pest movie that still think is the year worst so far although this one does give it run for its money as clown he overacts to the extreme never missing an opportunity for poor taste punchline leguizamo farts green mist munches pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons mini skirt and performs cheerleader routine all before turning into giant grey demon the guy was brilliant in to wong foo thanks for everything julie newmar what is he doing wasting his talent in this and the pest one of the few people that liked batman robin this summer other big budget comic book film yet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison can only hope people will change their minds and think of batman as the superior adaptation there compelling story somewhere in spawn including strong religious overtones and the debut of the first african american superhero ever but it just not found anywhere near here as it is spawn is just awful it stinks worse than dead trout
america loves convenience after all we re the culture that invented the cell phone the 24 hour atm and my most beloved the remote control yet perhaps this time with ghosts of mars we have taken our love of convenience to far ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as tough as nails pill poppin martian cop sent with her squadron to retrieve demolition williams ice cube from remote mining town for trial back home when she and her comrades appropriately dubbed the commander the rookies and the guy with the cool accent discover the town residents slaughtered they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents head chopping alien possessed clutches filled with lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks flashes sideways and viewpoint changes ghosts of mars is hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill conceived action sequences the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story ripped straight from the pages of 1970s zombie movie ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced most of these moments come off as kwik mart wisdom dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even tempered streetwise hand of ice cube with gun in one hand and dynamite cap in the other cube reminisces about his street life comparing the zombie stomping fun to me and my brother when we was kids apparently crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment but even in the film darkest moments fate conveniently lends hand supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite yes in the future man may travel to space and conquer mars but nothing beats good stick of tnt and as we all know every police station past present or future keeps healthy supply on hand characters die heads are lopped off but they were only supporting roles anyway so why should we care as long as you have plenty of narcotics immunity is guaranteed eventually though even the most well trained zombie alien gets bit uppity and needs to be taught lesson what better way than by sacrificing few minor characters to convenient nuclear detonation killing anything the machine guns can handle explosions are fun and even if the nukes don get them the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will in the end this film defines itself when our cop tribunal pronounces is that all you have to tell us for indeed john carpenter has run out of things to say and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell ridiculously bad story
lake placid marks yet another entry in the series of predator pics that were screen staple in the late 1970s post jaws and were revived recently by the godawful anaconda placid claims to be horror comedy it directed by the same guy who did house but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of anaconda paleontologist kelly scott bridget fonda is sent up to maine to examine tooth removed from body that had been bitten in half on the lake discovering that the tooth belongs to crocodile which shouldn even be in this hemisphere kelly goes croc hunting with game warden jack wells bill pullman and sheriff hank keough brendan gleeson they re joined by an unwelcome guest hector cyr oliver platt scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them along the way the merry band meets mrs delores bickerman betty beyaz weird old lady who lives out on the lake you know what to expect from this movie lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator croc cam swimming toward someone dangling legs while jaws like music plays one character hector who obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest another character who insists that the predator can possibly exist unlike its slippery cousin anaconda lake placid wants to present its formulaic plot tongue in cheek which is self defeating the result is neither scary nor funny it just tedious while director steve miner has several horror films on his resume including two installments of friday the 13th and halloween h20 screenwriter david kelley best known as the creator of tv series like ally mcbeal and chicago hope doesn seem to have the stomach for chomp em up flick the body count is surprisingly low and doesn include any of the major characters and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it lake placid manages to have it both ways ll let you discover how for yourself the croc itself is mostly computer generated of course like the snake in anaconda the thirty foot monster crocodile doesn seem real it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural lake placid also offers little explanation for why giant crocodile is in maine there is lot of semi mystical mumbo jumbo about how we really don know much about crocodiles they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers movie like this doesn have to offer much of an explanation radioactive mutant creature from outer space but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on pullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto pilot most of the time they re probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers platt and beyaz on the other hand seem to be giving their best efforts and they manage to squeeze few chuckles out of this sorry script
of course knew this going in why is it that whenever tv star makes movie it always romantic comedy and then they say on entertainment tonight or something that they were attracted to the characters they were really original original let me give you run through of picture perfect character kate jennifer aniston from tv friends smart beautiful professional woman wants two things she can have new job title and the love of her co worker kevin bacon her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets mortgage and gets lease on german sportscar and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls what does she do she invents fiance then when everyone wants to meet him she tells some poor schmoe she met at wedding that she will pay him $1000 to pretend to be in love with her for company dinner and pick fight with her at the end thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job since the guy ends up looking like jerk and she is the poor defenceless female he of course goes along with it gee wonder if they get together in the end ve seen more original stuff on the wb and better stuff too picture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes and expecting us to like aniston character who comes off as cold spoiled bitch
it rocks actually lots of rocks fly at us or from us in slow or fast motion at several points in the film they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward and when they land once in while when we need break from the space sequences they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like nary mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon steroid user answer to deep impact bruce willis stars as harry stamper famed oil driller commissioned by the beyaz house and nasa to stop giant asteroid before it travels beyond zero barrier and destroys our planet why an oil driller they require someone experience with deep core mining to plant nuclear missile into said asteroid in one unintentionally hilarious sequence nasa asks harry to inspect deep core driller they built based on his blueprints it is poorly constructed harry criticizes almost every aspect of it we trust nasa to build space shuttles harry assembles the obligatory ragtag bunch of cowboys including blond guy fat guy siyah guy wiseass and the man who is sleeping with his daughter affleck once they reach space we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong perhaps the fact that they sent bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes whether or not they save the day will not reveal nor will you care will say this you know you re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope willis has barely chance to come alive ditto for affleck their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act in last minute and futile attempt to inject warmth into the material steve buscemi character the wiseass is exceptionally problematic rockhound as he called is sarcastic and foolish so they tape him to chair where he spends most of the film so why did they bring him up there to begin with rather why write him into the film give his almost witty one liners to serious willis who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel at least in my world where the sky is mavi liv tyler is pretty and humourless as always suspiciously four of her father band aerosmith songs grace the soundtrack director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick like ketchup eventually drowning the movie on screen the middle hour is non sensical pyrotechnic assault on the average primate brain whenever someone dies in this movie crew member inevitably yells out we lost insert dead person last name here must admit that not once could distinguish dead oil guy cum astronaut from live one and close ups of the corpses faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance as their skin was often covered in fake blood armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla it looks nicer and has fewer plot holes within its equally ludicrous framework it has vivid soundmix but at almost two and half hours could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story the love story has been played up in the ads perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic fever bollocks the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in moon crawler remember little film called jaws in this film three independent minded men suddenly found themselves on fishing boat in pursuit of deadly shark they didn much like each other at first eventually they started to respect one another one of jaws great scenes involved the would be ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories this is the sort of male bonding foreign to bay or his producer jerry bruckheimer who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before action was called male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps cannot relate to bunch of men who don bare their souls who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and kind of chest beating bravery to this will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic nor brave nor smart even this team couldn build birdhouse and if get no respect for disliking movie with all the synthetic feeling of trailer trailer for movie written by team of body builders and greeting card authors ve never been prouder wimp my whole life

something is fishy in the state of universal about ten years back with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior post apocalypse nitty gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies we ve always had movies of this nature on the beach the end of the world damnation alley the ultimate warrior and so on to date the most smoothly done were straightforward haircuts of the classic western plot like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization usually one in possession of some critical resource like water feed range or mining claim most of these grew out of venerable but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane my personal favorite is patrick swayze movie called steel dawn which was fairly well made on small budget now we have waterworld which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter well she not widow and the kid isn her daughter but you get the idea the lady is helen played by the stunning jean tripplehorn who isn given chance to be stunning or even interesting by the mediocre and unimaginative script the child enola played by tina majorino is living proof that child actor need not be bad thing to have in movie she outshines her material all the way through in simple the scene is earth hundreds of years from now the polar ice caps have melted and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies and survive by trade theft or piracy somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries and its inhabitants called smokers are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials so the bad guys have outboard engines and fast moving boats airplanes and jet skis enola found at sea as young girl has mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical dryland the place where trees crops and animals grow and what plot there is hinges on who has enola the psycho ruler of the smokers the deacon is trying to get her and find his way to dryland played with typical self lampooning rug chewing histrionics by dennis hopper deacon is the only thing in the movie that close to amusing his performance is almost laughable but there just isn enough there to be funny the star and co producer is kevin costner he playing an un named lone denizen of the sea man called the mariner who turns out to be gilled water breathing mutant with webbed feet very little is done with this the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support human metabolism it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted much of the earth surface would still be above water and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown canned meat does not last for centuries ammunition does not fire after it more than few decades old and so on and so on quite fond of tina majorino previous work very impressed by jean tripplehorn past accomplishments and still speechless over costner dances with wolves but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it this movie cost one hundred and eighty two million dollars and there nothing in it we haven seen before done better on only few percent of the cost of this turkey at 125 minutes of material this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make the budget of this movie could have given us over thirty movies it could have paid for six years of prime time sf tv series with expensive fx work or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx in sum this movie is beneath contempt it has nothing new to offer it has script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc and it spent more money than the national budget of small nation if you have to go see it see it on four dollar matinee otherwise you ll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass reflective surface for weeks
this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation but lo and behold here comes switchback and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as kiss the girls and know what you did last summer but switchback is an undoubtedly weak genre entry as the material it covers is old and tired and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting switchback opens with the murder of babysitter and the abduction of the young child she watching we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse dennis quaid and that the kidnapper killer is nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite while he is promptly removed from the case but this conflict of interest doesn keep him from offering pursuit lacrosse most recent trek takes him to blood soaked hotel room in amarillo texas where the local sheriff lee ermey is torn between his re election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man in related aside former railway worker bob goodall danny glover is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup plastered even on the seatbelts el dorado along the way he picks up and subsequently saves the life of hitchhiking loner lane dixon jared leto this tangent isn random one as bob or lane will end up either holding piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself or is the villain in fact lacrosse only pretending to be after the cold hearted murderer he knows so much about in sense that half of the basic problem with switchback for its first hour the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator so we re given little insight into who they are likely for fear that we ll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction but switchback then decides to explicitly reveal the killer identity at its midpoint and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense some of the acting is burdensome area as well probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves what is danny glover doing here grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot and dennis quaid that monotone stop it ermey is solid in supporting role that more interesting than the two leads thrown together but the charismatic leto claire danes object of affection in my so called life is scene stealer tried and true >from material standpoint switchback is pretty empty but even when first time director jeb stuart who wrote the fugitive and die hard doesn know what to do he knows what he wants it to look like the movie provides some great visuals the set on train climax looks good even though the action is illogical and the beautiful crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor still that not enough to turn lump of coal into diamond and more than the movie look will end up leaving you cold
it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of todays movies or novels you must suspend disbelief however there is distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing bunch of flat lies it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg indiana where the film is set does not have mcdonald sears store statue of man on horse nor even dam close by even if you can ignore these somewhat white lies even though the dam is crucial to hard rains plot there is still bunch of things that just dont gel firstly morgan freeman possibly the greatest actor alive after such films as driving miss daisy the shawshank redemption and se7en was cast as shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for healthy retirement he _should_ have played the town sheriff an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman as massive flood started by dam accident overwhelms huntingburg its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them and it seems tad strange that an entire town with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way can vanish before the flood has actually started but nether the less armored guard couriers tom christian slater and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van with heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads it doesnt take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road jim morgan freeman and small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars but of course tom is more than willing to save the day so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town the local sheriff randy quaid whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 and couple of police men investigate the situation but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he she would do with their share of the three million dollars director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy turvy and whilst the film may at first appear to be definite goodies versus baddies there are numerous twists in its plot that make this slightly more enjoyable experience but by the time these interesting changes occur its far too late in the film for them to have much affect hard rains continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had and although its cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par not at one stage capturing what could have been fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected such titles as broken arrow slater and john travolta and face off nicholas cage and john travolta come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations strangely enough they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta we can forgive morgan freeman for giving slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost movie prior to the release of broken arrow my answer would have been definite no now know that he has no excuse and _can_ do better if you dont believe me rent copy of broken arrow from your local video store although hard rain never really works from the start somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen the addition of an enticing sub plot would have given the film time to breathe rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into story that cant handle anything else despite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account if your standards are low enough you may find this to be mildly enjoyable film no creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors but it doesnt really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $8 50 is compare this to other films
desperate measures is generic title for film that beyond generic it also depressing waste of talent with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles not to mention once cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not cool flicks this thriller is more before and after than reversal of fortune the movie is big disappointment and yet it somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it the premise is both promising and intriguing too bad the execution all wrong though because the set up of desperate measures boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use san francisco cop frank connor garcia is single parent with troubling dilemma his son matt joseph cross is stricken with cancer which only bone marrow transplant can push into remission even worse the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe michael keaton currently serving life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery he at first reluctant but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital when he does make run for it connor offers close pursuit but for different reasons than his superiors including the crusty brian cox they want to take mccabe down while connor needs to keep him alive or all hope is lost for his little boy one misstep desperate measures makes is in its underdevelopment of matt illness what needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just little too hard to swallow take for example scene where mccabe is trying to make getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him and what does connor do he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son whatever to be fair though the lack of story background is the least of the movie problems first and foremost is how cheaply desperate measures trades the potential of it opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour once mccabe escapes the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab hostage and get away also the movie is so intent on giving you hoot inducing lip smacking villain the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter natch that it completely casts garcia frank connor by the dullsville wayside desperate measures appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist and the movie head scratcher of send off confirms this there is some good to be found amongst this mess particularly in the acting department cast against type michael keaton understated menace is highly effective although he not given much believable to work with andy garcia plays off taut emotional chord joseph cross as garicia ailing son is surprisingly unsentimental and marcia gay harden lends solid support as doctor who becomes major player in the unfolding chaos this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending but most is lost it goes without saying that desperate measures needs an operation of its very own
so it thirty years later and oscar and felix are together again that might have been an exciting notion if it wasn for the fact that the odd couple of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies 1993 grumpy old men 1995 grumpier old men and 1997 out to sea grumpiest old men so the odd couple ii the grumpiest old men of all really seems just another entry in tired series the plot is even similar to that of grumpy old men in that lemmon and matthau mismatched characters are brought together by romance between their children oscar son jonathan silverman and felix daughter lisa waltz are getting married and former roommates felix ungar lemmon and oscar madison matthau meet at the airport and decide to share car then hilarity ensues well few chuckles ensue anyway neil simon the award winning playwright who created oscar and felix provides the screenplay which is shock because the script is piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end unlike the original play movie odd couple ii doesn find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters instead it depends upon series of humorous situations oscar and felix lose the car over cliff are caught smuggling mexicans over the border take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands the women are played by christine baranski of cybill and jean smart of designing women and hitch ride with man who dies in the desert the original 1968 movie the odd couple remains classic comedy it introduced the motif of roommate as spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since it was the second outing for the lemmon matthau team which debuted in 1966 the fortune cookie and they made couple more worthwhile comedies the front page 1974 and buddy buddy 1981 before going their separate ways the reunion of lemmon and matthau in grumpy old men six years ago was delightful and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie but out to sea and the odd couple ii are just beating grumpy old horse you can add lemmon my fellow americans grumpy old presidents to that list too let hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do let hope also that we see neil simon name on movies that do it justice this is his first since 1993 lost in yonkers
the camera zooms in incredibly close it focuses on the closed eyes of person presumed dead all of sudden with thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse his eyelids open the camera zooms in incredibly close it focuses on one of the characters desperately running for her life then with thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse she bumps into the killer the camera zooms in incredibly close it focuses on door from where seemingly strange sounds emanate all of sudden with thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse the doors swing open to reveal what inside close up thrill shots such as these seemed to elicit more laughter from the audience rather than genuine fear which is pretty good sign that you re not watching the thriller that the director had originally envisioned rather you adopt the opinion that the characters are so goofy and so unaware of the trouble that they re in that you stop caring about who lives who dies and where the story goes instead you become more interested in how the characters get killed off the four young teenagers who are the potential sacrificial lambs for this movie are helen and barry and julie and ray two couples and dear friends to one another during the summer just after high school graduation they take fateful drive down dark mountain highway suddenly without warning their car hits someone whom the teens presume was killed as result of that collision fearing jail time and possible manslaughter charges if they confess they instead decide to dump the body into the ocean and make pact never to discuss the episode again year goes by and things among the four friends begin to change relationships fizzle future dreams crumble and attitudes change but they can not forget what they did and apparently neither can someone else someone begins to send letters to all four of the teens with the frightening message know what you did last summer the letter writer figure in rubber slicker wielding large metal hook soon makes his presence known and begins to hunt down the four teens it now up to the four of them to try to figure out who the killer is before it too late while this movie has some nice visually eerie effects too much of it impact had to be generated with extreme close ups while the level of suspense was choppy at best there is so much more that this movie could have been but decided to give us nothing but cheap thrills it could have been clever whodunit but discovering who ultimately was the killer made me just shrug my shoulders it could have explored the changed friendships after year of adulthood but seemed to only include that aspect to add 15 more minutes to the film it could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime you re alone and you see shadowy figures moving about you don walk towards them yelling hello once you yell hello you can expect an extreme close up thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse it difficult to be in suspense when you know what about to happen the only redeeming aspect of the movie is that now have neat idea for halloween costume but not sure if the local costume store sells rubber slickers and hooks the horror that experienced from this film is realizing that actually went to see it
it always bad sign when the core audience of film children are either walking out early or are half asleep when the credits roll at the end of film that about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians cold pea soup of cute animals stupid home alone antics boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression indeed walt disney is rolling over in his grave again cursing john hughes name for making the original live action 101 dalmatians one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time and now its sequel the main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor 101 dalmatians the original made more than $100 million dollars at the box office spawned torrid collection of collectible items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal marts across the country and generally made every kid on the planet want damn dalmatian pup for christmas well it been about four years since then and dalmatian fever is coming back and this time it digitally enhanced here the story cruella de vil glenn close is released from prison due to the cure of her puppy homicide urges by one dr pavlov oh how witty she rejoins the world as dog lover and is assigned to probation officer who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film cruella then becomes ella dog lover until the plot twists like dog with his leash caught on the back of moving truck and she becomes the evil vixen again kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula at this point was envying those kids filing out of the theater how low have glenn close and gerard depardieu as the film villain sunk in the film business it almost laughable in sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon and depardieu how can french guy have bad french accent and never mind the toilet brush haircut the only minutely positive selling point can even think to point out is the talking bird with british accent courtesy of eric idle that thinks he rottweiler now that funny
54 is dull perfunctory uninspired and boring greater writer might have created lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors however would rather cut to the chase 54 is dull perfunctory uninspired and boring there is nothing in it not glimpse of depth nor shimmer of intelligence or insight there is no electricity in any of the scenes or moment of interest in the story or its subplots and it underdeveloped and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they re in this year boogie nights they are so wrong the picture has been assembled by mark christopher based on this film don know how he got job in the business 54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s don know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson brilliant work in every possible way from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography what it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great depth intelligence energy fascinating characters and challenging themes 54 can even measure up to the last days of disco which is flawed but still smart and entertaining it remarkably bad timing say to release film this tedious after couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind have exaggerated though there is one interesting character and one terrific performance that character is steve rubell played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves steve rubell is the owner of studio 54 and if christopher had focused on him then myers could have forced good film out of this wreck all by himself alas we are instead guided to endure the trials of young man named shane ryan phillippe going nowhere new jersey teen who gets job in the club thanks to rubell homosexual impulses it here that he meets his friends the array of uninteresting characters his co worker greg brecklin meyer his wife anita salma hayek and of course the love interest julie siyah neve campbell shane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning and he has reasonably sturdy home life some of the scenes with his father border on interesting while heather matarazzo who plays his sister pushes phillippe off the screen but he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs why his friends push him into drugs is never really explained but the fact that they are friends is questioned only is superficial ways greg gets really mad at shane because he been elevated to bartender status there isn single conflict that takes center stage except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works most of the film is dumb and most of the dialogue is inane there scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie siyah and in the next scene they re arm in arm without bit of development then they re kissing in bowling alley this is five minutes of material thrown into the picture at the last minute well past the one hour mark and this isn long film to begin with campbell is talented actress but she needs role that gives her little depth this one doesn and phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg star making role in boogie nights he seems dumb and misguided and his voice never changes tone guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body but he seems pretty lanky to me he all wrong for lead role but it doesn help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters by the end of 54 shane most notable trait is his stupid fake accent the rest of the performances are wasted hayek is an energetic talented young actress and does almost nothing here meyer is endearing but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard only myers by sheer force of talent manages to rise above christopher wading pool of script rubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance in fact myers is the sole reason to see 54 and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him ve read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail frankly don care it easy to recreate something technical like this fairly skilled production designer and few carpenters can manage such task besides christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible anyway aside from myers performance 54 is complete failure it dull perfunctory uninspired and boring some may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair but they re so obvious to me in any event 54 is pallid without the contrast it doesn even work as mindless entertainment it so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it so don forget those key words dull perfunctory uninspired and boring everything else said was just padding
susan granger review of jeepers creepers mgm ua entertainment this nasty little horror film begins as bickering brother justin long and sister gina philips are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy man dropping wrapped up bodies down drainage pipe when long decides to investigate there nothing but trouble you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it well this is it philips warns what he finds in the basement of an old abandoned church is dying boy with horrifying jagged stitched incision from his neck to his navel plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies stitched together on the walls and ceiling like disgusting tapestry long flees but now the monstrous winged creeper jonathan breck is after both of them eileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady and patricia belcher is jezelle psychic who explains the evil creature bizarre feeding habits on the granger movie gauge of to 10 jeepers creepers is fiendishly visceral with an extraordinarily gruesome conclusion giving new meaning to the old song jeepers creepers and now as paul harvey would say for the rest of the story what more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that writer director victor salva is convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with 12 year old actor in california sentenced to three years in prison he served 15 months and completed parole in 1992 when salva made powder 1995 the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilities disney studio executives claimed that they did not know about his prior conviction as pedophile and now once again in this mgm ua film that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio
capsule the much anticipated re adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as dark and little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting but very little intelligence visually there is much to like about this version but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver travels and treat it as an action film that makes it film without much center to +4 pierre boulle author of the bridge on the river kwai wrote planet of the apes monkey planet the novel as social satire it reads lot like fifth book of gulliver travels humans discover planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift island of the houyhnhnms the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet it seems to me there is also statement about human cruelty to animals but perhaps was just looking for that when rod serling adapted the novel into film released in 1968 he added number of serling touches familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling ish the final irony of the original version has become film history without it there could never have been planet of the apes film series can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language that could have been done in the film but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non ape speaking serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and of course there is some justification for that by the end of the film justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending but serling never tackles the all important question of why supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language language they had no opportunity to ever hear few viewers questioned this serious plot hole however and the film has become well respected in cinema history partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith best if not his best when the film success called for sequels the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well intentioned though not very subtle political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s while the first film had little shooting of guns and what was there seemed little half hearted by the second film beneath the planet of the apes there was good deal more violence and from that point on the series had lot of violence and chases the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book burton new version is even less faithful first he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes he has them both be intelligent articulate races battling for dominance of the planet currently in the hands uh make that paws of the apes that could be good story too but it is not planet of the apes as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring in 2029 leo davidson mark wahlberg not this world most expressive actor works on space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes then convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard of oz fashion and drops him on an alien planet yes he survives this storm but then no storm is perfect he quickly finds not greatly to any surprise he shows that on this planet apes rule and humans drool but everybody talks and the language they talk is earth english apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is mystery that needs to be explained about that the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not look at human animal relationships and more one of the master slave relationships outside of sudan and few other countries this is less relevant topic leo is captured to be used as slave but also is discovered by ari played by helena bonham carter ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power she is bent on making the world better place perhaps in previous draft of the script she was called hil ari in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in film she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only couple of sympathetic apes this is further abandonment of the source material the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each place in this reversed society each important in the book we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn this is miscalculation as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win the 1968 script had little subtlety with lines like never met an ape didn like but at least we cared for what happened to taylor the main character most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog this tends to limit close looks at the makeup in general it seems much improved from 1968 the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers who did it for the 1968 version in 1968 chambers makeup was jaw dropper it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion chambers is good but if anyone had chance to best him it would have to be baker today audiences have higher expectations baker visualization is really an improvement these visuals work nicely what does not work is the wire assisted leaps some of the apes make they look like they were inspired by the physics defying leaps of crouching tiger hidden dragon apes spring incredible distances some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only small group of people close up since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in role that required heavy make up the one actor who has shot is paul giamatti it is not that his lines are so good most are silly jokes but he delivers them very well he was always watchable actor but has not yet made stardom as the ape trader limbo he over emotes to overcome his ape make up but does it very well in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov performance in spartacus as an in joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself danny elfman score has nice primitive feel but jerry goldsmith 1968 tour de force score is real classic that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten rate the remake on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale
as far as mystery men is concerned the burning question is less is it really as bad as it looks from the trailer the answer there is an unequivocal yes and more how in the name of sweet jesus did first time director kinka usher get such first rate cast to act in this muck mystery men features greg kinnear as the heavily sponsored captain amazing and geoffrey rush as his arch nemesis singular casanova frankenstein veritable police lineup of hot hollywood talent plays the superhero wannabes of the title who join forces to get amazing out of tight spot when frankenstein puts the screws on champion city there william macy as the mild mannered shoveler hank azaria as the cutlery flinging mavi raja no knives but phony english accent that just as sharp ben stiller as mr furious whose only power seems to be his ability to get hot under the collar janeane garofalo as crazed bowler with her father skull interestingly preserved wes studi as rhetoric spouting cowled avenger and kel mitchell as the token and adding insult to injury invisible black guy bringing up the rear so to speak is paul reubens yes that pee wee herman paul reubens as well let just call him the gas man the production design is overblown the special effects are overdone and the script based on bob burden dark horse comic book series is overbaked the appealing actors are uniformly good and stiller is even stellar but they can begin to save mystery men it just one big mess you re better off renting the video and pressing fast forward to get to the funny bits believe counted three
georges polti once wrote paper called the thirty six dramatic situations in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty six different situations this may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes there nothing new under the sun the faculty the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion there not measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers screenwriter kevin williamson of scream credit gives us horror tale set in middle america ohio one eventful fall making use of cast of unusually stock characters williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day style but rather through the back door parasitic aliens take over the faculty of run down high school and soon have infested most of the student body leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day the lack of gusto is the movie major stumbling block even though the genre has seen movies that have lack for quality such as this they ve been saved by an energetic approach this casts more than shadow of doubt on williamson ability who enjoyed success with the wes craven directed scream but couldn pull anything solid in for this outing or know what you did last summer although he designs the faculty with more of sci fi bent than his typical slasher picture it still comes down to the same results throw the stock characters in steel cage match and see who comes out alive on that level the main roles are played by virtual unknowns only the recognizeable elijah wood deep impact is at the front other than that the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up and comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved but to do that they all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty la dawson creek needless to say the acting is far from top notch nor does necessity ask that it should be there is moment or two of genuine horror but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci fi direction to make any use of it in sum the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off
as bad as mimic was it definitly scared me mimic continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking foreign director who shows lot of creative ingenuity and style and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make movie director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film cronos that movie worked because it took an unconventional story unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create truly scary movie in mimic del toro doesn bother to give us anything original the plot is stupid combination of aliens meets species meets jurassic park the characters have been recycled from few hundred other movies there nothing new in mimic it just bunch of old tricks that rarely work at the end of the movie you re stuck wanting your money back maybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies he forgot to turn the lights on don understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the seven trend and be set in dark dank areas watching mimic was tempted several times to yell at the screen turn the lights on the switch is to your right use common sense just do it you ll be able to see the monster in the corner there scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off it looked like the light operator was having seizure and sorvino didn even notice she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts hmmm think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight mimic has lot of incidental shock tactics boo just kidding and follows them up with the real scare but nothing in this movie scares you the audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments think they were bored too shouldn blame del toro he isn the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make bad movie hong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time the killer and hard boiled then came to america to make the stupid broken arrow french directors luc besson la femme nikita and george sluizer the vanishing followed woo lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies robert rodriguez who directed the terrific low budget el mariachi came to hollywood and directed the horrible high budget desperado don know why foreign director who shows such talent in his country can make good american movie woo finally broke through and made face off but it still isn up to par with his earlier films get the feeling hollywood producer sits in his office chews on big smelly cigar and says to the director welcome to america bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long do you speak english now know you think you ve made good movies in the past but now you re in america so things are little different here just remember what the american audience always wants and you ll be fine they want to see at least one big breasted woman characters that they ve seen thousand times before because change scares americans and you always need cheesy feel good ending to wrap things up if you don make that kind of movie you ll be shining my shoes in no time
hey ve got great idea for movie ok here it is we ll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so what that sounds too boring ok how about this then we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours but half of them are angry looks and half of them are in pain looks what that that still doesn sound funny to you how about if we through in some ewwwww looks still not funny if you answered no that doesn sound funny then ding ding ding you re absolutely correct for richer or poorer is moronic farce about rich married couple played by tim allen and kirstie alley who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant wayne knight best know as newman on tv seinfeld gets them in trouble for tax evasion what ensues is badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell what makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs namely talent backing up the married couple is brad and caroline sexton allen and alley popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else but in reality are on the brink of divorce just as their marriage seems to be hanging from it final thread brad discovers that his accountant bob lachman knight has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton names the irs catches on but since everything points back to the sexton and not lachman there is nothing much to do except run away and join an amish community first time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us couple of chuckle out loud moments and even some decent laughs here and way over there but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you ll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn alley is absolutely unwatchable and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade which inform you was total allen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons nor are they very convincing as an amish couple this entire movie is one bad ill conceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning the amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing it such trite stereotypical script that imagine the actors that were cast noticing that they re all predominantly tv figures were probably the only ones they could get bryan spicer directing doesn help one bit either in fact listing spicer filmography which includes the first power rangers movie and the big screen adaption of mchale navy is more of an insult than sum now that ve pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground will let you in on the best thing about it it bumped seven films up notch on my worst of 1997 movie list that right thanks to this film ranking at number for the year worst six films are now not seemingly as bad and smile like yours previously inhabiting the number ten spot now doesn have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list if you look at it in that respect for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all
while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation we had yet another shoddy subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks and once again we have one of the worst films of the year the trend of the moment and bear in mind it trend not movie is spawn and if you ve seen the animated series on hbo you ll recall it embodies the lost life of disfigured man an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment he been sent to hell todd mcfarlane the creator of the spawn comic book must have had tough time sitting through spawn for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects style over substance ambience over anything else not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects the story about bewildered individual who must take on group of bad guys and find himself in the process is realized in such sordid incapable manner it becomes indigestible after while every character in this film is lifeless vacuous and seemingly written by depressed college student the story begins like in every superhero movie in this age with man living an idyllic life al simmons michael jai beyaz government agent assassin shares the love of his wife wanda theresa russell and daughter has tongue in cheek wiseass partner terry sweeney and is content with the job his boss jason wynn martin sheen provides him the next element in the film is the part when things go awry and as expected everyone turns the tables on poor al as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant al is befriended by jason and dies in gory and truly sickening scene inevitably it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away hence jason mischievous master mind plan to conquer the world is just commencing its initial stages when al makes pact with satan himself agreeing to command the devil army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again so our pal al has been uplifted to hell and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place his ol partner terry forms relationship with his wife time passes and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city the ghetto where cog nicol williamson teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts his motorbike armor etc this character is merely poor man obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla now the stage is set spawn the new `enemy of evil vs evil and evil takes the cake doubtlessly john leguizamo deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film relief point all this anguish pain half baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo who steals the show and derives joy from his character which is basically compilation of so so one liners and then there martin sheen whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent as the megalomaniac boss his caricature plays like bad dream out of movie scrambled and left in the shelf to rot this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street never thought be saying this but at this juncture charlie sheen career is in better shape spawn is movie in which realism or even an attempt to draw parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable for most of the film the vapid michael jai beyaz consumes his time ogling jumping through roofs and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better it constantly reminded us we were watching superhero movie very bad superhero movie continually the film kept on depending on special effects and sadly this is how pictures are being made perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting it is perceptible that director mark dippe attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton batman did touch the desperation of man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act but bruce wayne had human elements to him he was pensive resourceful and had relationships which made our perspective on him equally human the character of al simmons seems to be longing for drastic change as if he fatigued about being normal and as all superheroes batman superman the phantom they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary none of this is present in spawn the fighting sequences are weakly executed the dialogue is penny dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner as an example of this film vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten and then rescued by spawn so our emotions tend to be little more sympathetic admittedly did laugh once in the film and that when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as bum it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature besides blaming large portion of it on the laughable school system condemn the other part to garbage like spawn movies that present no admiration no captivation no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to and kids will continue to see films like spawn simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one children are not muppets and spawn unapologetically targets children
hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city the lawyer kevin lomax keanu reeves is not offered job yet he is asked to simply pick jury he accepts the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered job with the firm making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money but gorgeous apartment he convinces his wife mary ann charlize theron to make the move to new york the first case given to him is big test winless case concerning man who sacrifices animals in his basement the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal his new boss and partner in the firm john milton al pacino is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing explaining many of his philosophies on law women and sex and angles the promise of blissful wealthy life kevin next case is dream case given to him by milton himself much to the chagrin to his colleagues defending triple murder suspect who has had history of problems with the law although kevin career is taking off his home life is not doing very well mary ann is starting to have numerous problems she is experiencing severe depression over kevin long hours and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls their faces becoming horribly disfigured kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with then focus all of his attention on his wife not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about possible affair with sexy lawyer connie nielson also working with the firm mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife and gets disturbing news from his mother judith ivey about the mystery concerning the identity of his father he also starts to lose control of his case kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man that man is his boss mr milton truly evil character who just may be the devil himself kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store but how do you defeat the devil why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd do filmmakers really believe that normal courtroom drama doesn fit the bill and they have to juice them up the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in real courtroom which wouldn have been too bad if it weren keanu reeves trying to pull it off give reeves credit for trying hard but throughout the movie never saw the kevin lomax character just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short charlize theron defines the term over the top in her performance as mary ann lomax disappointment in contrast to her good performance in days in the valley the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino but kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil and you can tell he is having fun doing so but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him it pretty standard stuff including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled but have to get something off of my chest in 1986 remember watching movie called wisdom with emilio estevez and demi moore and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that movie could do what like to call guess what it was all dream scenario in wisdom the two lead characters are killed at the end only to have one of the characters wake up from an apparent and say gosh glad that didn really happen considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with well the same thing happens in the devils advocate and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually dream perhaps milton went back in time to try different route for his plan since it failed and he is the devil but the point is that the last 90% of the film didn happen know it stretch after all it is movie and nothing really happened but just get annoyed to get toyed with like that of course the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one as recall wisdom was decent film the devil advocate is not the devils advocate directed by taylor hackford john milton al pacino kevin lomax keanu reeves mary ann lomax charlize theron mrs lomax judith ivey eddie barzoon jeffrey jones christabella connie nielson written by randy turgeon march 18 1998
have always been fan of director neil jordan from his early work such as 1984 the company of wolves to 1992 the crying game and 1994 interview with vampire his latest film the butcher boy is return to his roots in ireland but unfortunately it is not successful homecoming told through the eyes of 12 year old irish boy francis newcomer eomann owens this peculiar film follows him as we learn little about his decidedly unstable life his father stephen rea is an indifferent alcoholic his mother fiona shaw is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore francis is the type of boy who always has lot to say but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be little psychotic even capable of brutal murder the premise of the butcher boy is one that could have very well been turned into thought provoking disturbing motion picture but somehow nothing works francis is in almost every scene but we learn very little about him as if the film was distancing itself away from him when suspect we were actually supposed to sympathize with him this is definately not young owens fault however because he gives brilliantly accurate performance and is able to also seem menacing as well the fact that we don get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay the supporting characters are no help though rea is wasted and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son or to anyone else for that matter he usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout shaw has little bit more to work with since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in time of despair but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her and singer sinead connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice the pacing is all off in the butcher boy although the story could have been dynamite it moves at deadeningly slow rate and found my mind wandering every once in while it is also very episodic because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs at one point francis is sent away to juvenile prison and an odd possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between priest and himself but nothing comes of it rather think of the butcher boy as brief diversion for director jordan rather than total misfire he has already proven to be strong director but he lucked out with this latest film what could have been courageous unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy only manages to be an ineffective uninvolivng bore
the obvious reason for producing sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits the rationale is sound but in many cases of this and recent years the sequel is shoddy product that exposed for the cash milking vehicle it really is last year speed and scream as well as this year species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory in some cases sequel can even discredit its predecessor as with the latest neo slasher flick still know what you did last summer whatever uniqueness the original might ve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller julie james jennifer love hewitt and ray bronson freddie prinze jr are back from the original to star in still know reprising their roles in typical fashion julie and ray experience rather predictable falling out at the beginning of the movie leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson matthew settle will and julie hit it off and along with friends karla brandy norwood and tyrell mekhi phifer the foursome heads off to radio station giveaway vacation in the tropics unfortunately things aren so peachy once they arrive and with regularity you could set your watch by the infamous fisherman muse watson is back with his hook it another bloody showdown complete with cliffhanger ending there not much that original about still know and with the market saturated by gen thrillers like this one it unlikely that still know will get any recognition other than that of bad sequel for die hard fans of the genre this will be required viewing material but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original know what you did last summer the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn heightened by skillful scripting or camera work but rather tense string based score and manipulative editing the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue he goes from being scary figure to nutcase in few short and painful moments much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point the whole reason the plot exists julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station is dead giveaway lessening suspense and creating hurry up and wait timing problem and whereas the killer identity might ve been question in the first movie it almost given here which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically three or four teens run automatically from man in rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as the killer they re almost used to it and the performances show it not hewitt nor prinze nor brandy nor phifer give decent show and so in the end it left wide open for third movie and most likely brand new supporting cast god help us
it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others myself included would pick seven days in may both those films were tense exercises in chills the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man john frankenheimer but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed each of those films had memorable characters and tense plot they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay the thrills all came from the plot ronin is like film made by another man somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot but we see only tiny pieces of it we get clue here and one there as to what is going on but zeik screenplay is bit obscure the film begins explaining that ronin is masterless samurai when samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death he becomes ronin much like gunfighter in the american west if you miss the opening do not worry this film will explain again what ronin is sam played by robert de niro is the modern equivalent of ronin he is free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of professional killer he clearly was in dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france sam is recruited from montmartre bar by dierdre natascha mcelhone of the truman show an irish woman to be part of an action to steal mysterious metal case dierdre is very tight lipped about what is in the case sam joins team of four others vincent jean reno of the professional leon and mission impossible spence sean bean tv richard sharpe and also patriot games and goldeneye and gregor stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting also along is larry skipp suddeth the group seems to know their business particularly sam but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise their only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team the story is not very easy to follow it is never clear who is double crossing whom and who is working for whom somehow russians who may or may not be the russian mafia and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on certain metal case some very good actors are involved in this film one wonders what they saw in the script the characters are mostly one dimensional professional killers they know their work and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed by the end of the film we never really got to know anybody maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts since these are not very demanding characters to create in addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal as revival of sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy unfortunately there are no deep characters and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it rate ronin on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale non spoiler incidentally the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin also one frequently sees in japanese art the image of man breaking down door with huge mallet this is the first blow of the 47 ronin
here sit at my computer about to write my review of the recent action comedy bait starring jamie foxx and david morse this is review don even want to write because just be laying the same criticisms on it that would with any other so generic and predictable it beyond ridiculous piece of hollywood fluff if they re not going to give us the audience just little credit and put something together with half brain why should waste my time and mental energy criticising it last summer took this same approach with my review of the mummy in that review just quoted phrases my reviews of other sub par movies think shall do the same thing here but with few less quotes not all are applicable hope this goes to show you what think of bait and why you can find out all you need to know about it without having to take wild guess it genuinely unfunny and the other audience members only laughed once during the entire two hours unoriginal and unthrilling it not so bad to the point where it fun to watch because of its badness and it no so bad you absolute loathe it and are pained by watching it it just such cliche in and of itself that uhh lost my train of thought anyways here those quotes enjoy getting an audience attention right from the beginning plays major role in how today films work we want to have something exciting to watch not slow build up of story god forbid and this film plays right into the mainstream hands review of armageddon it clear the film doesn want to waste time on reality and thus the attempt to establish plausability the most minimal amount necessary comes across as half assed effort supporting characters and shady sup plots are introduced but as is the case with films made up of large cast of characters only handful have any real significance there fine line separating homage from plagiarism review of godzilla 1998 unfortunately as is the case with most modern thrillers once the film showed potential for authenticity and intelligence the cliches and action sequences take over review of the jackal chad movie page is back after heavy renovation reviews of nearly all mainstream movies playing today get my reviews of everything playing at your local cineplex so you can better make an informed decision on what to see don forget to vote on my poll and sign the guestbook
synopsis al simmons top notch assasin with guilty conscience dies in fiery explosion and goes to hell making pact with malebolgia chief demon there simmons returns to earth years later reborn as spawn general in hell army donning necroplasmic costume replete with knives chains and morphing cape sullen wise cogliostro and flatulating wisecracking violator vy for spawn attention comments when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics where he had made name for himself as first rate comic book penciller on the spider man titles to join the newly formed creator owned image comics new comic book legend was born spawn mcfarlane spawn immediately became commercial and critical success and defining comic book series of the 1990s mcfarlane created hero who was not only original but visually intricate allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max the early spawn issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing with the popularity of spawn and the success of the current warner bros batman film franchise movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn in the summer of 1997 hence new line cinema released spawn live action film based on the groundbreaking series this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book like me numbed by how much spawn misses the mark what happened why is spawn so bad todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in cameo don think however that his presence necessarily hurt or helped the film place the blame in part on the recent hollywood trend fueled by public demand apparently for special effects blow out movies utilizing the latest computer technology these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else character plot dialogue etc spawn reflecting this trend shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics hardly minute goes by in this film without fires explosions knives and chains appearing out of nowhere glowing eyes or constantly transforming demons lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid don get me wrong but because the script and cast aren engaging spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper the surface may capture the eye but nothing exists underneath spawn translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level mcfarlane spawn was tortured hero mercenary by trade al simmons was nonetheless warm man in love with the beautiful wanda having died and journeyed to hell he made pact to return to earth to be with wanda simmons however discovers that his memories are fragmented his body creepy mess and his wife married despite his sometimes violent nature readers couldn help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so when the characters are developed they seem absurd rather than touching the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot general possesses the antidote to supervirus called heat 16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world do not help matters spawn in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman also unwisely spends too much time on villain the violator batman favored the joker over batman john leguizamo like jack nicholson in batman receives top billing in the cast as the violator michael jai beyaz al simmons spawn is second ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him perfect candidate for the violator the film however spends so much time on the violator offensive antics that they grate on the nerves apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film as nicholson was in batman especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn the violator lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny leaving the audience wishing he would leave leguizamo does satisfactory job in the role but he is seen far too often in the film michael jai beyaz relative newcomer to theatrical releases seems to be an appealing actor and he handles his role adequately but we see little of him without various masks on more time needed to be spent on white character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings special note should be made about martin sheen as the over the top obnoxious evil general wynn easily the hammiest performance in the movie it hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much after all he played vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now sheen excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as mastermind villain and comes as surprise considering his extensive career in film many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down mtv style jerky in your face editing is one of them flames for example roll across the screen sometimes to announce shift in setting cogliostro unlikely wannabe guide for spawn serves as poor narrator for the film he goofily tells the audience at one point that how much of [spawn s] humanity is left remains to be seen as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another the music finally assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes to be fair however marilyn manson long hard road out of hell effectively compliments spawn return to earth while filter and the crystal method can you trip like do proves surprisingly fitting theme song for as good comic book as it is spawn did not spawn good movie spawn instead suffers from too much pomp and circumstance and too little plot and character development it receives two stars for its technically well done special effects many other films though have equal if not superior special effects and are much better rated pg 13 spawn seems more violent than many rated movies and probably wouldn be appropriate for the very young
`the bachelor is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see wading through this gooey detestable sludge is quite the chore for even dedicated romantic those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere `the bachelor is painfully clumsy mess strung together with few brief moments of surprising poignancy awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty boy cocoon chris donnell has an effortless charm as an actor most will recognize him as the high flying robin from the two latest `batman films but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile can donnell carry the weight of film on his shoulders perhaps if he found the proper vehicle but `the bachelor falls far short of the requirements the actor just can register with such pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success few instances of adorable humor aside it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is `the bachelor donnell plays jimmie hopeless romantic in his late twenties who progressing in serious relationship with anne renee zellweger jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage the problem is that his proposal sucks big time you can tell things aren going pleasantly because jimmie gets the infamous deer in the headlights look when anne questions his approach and then the plot along with the stupidity of the movie thickens jimmie grandfather peter ustinov dies suddenly leaving video will behind for his grandson who also happens to be his only living relative everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie of course there catch he must get married before his 30th birthday stay joined with his bride for an entire decade and produce healthy children within the first five years the bad news is that jimmie birthday is the following day with anne out of town he must find willing bride to share his riches with and within very limited time frame there are certainly few worthwhile aspects of `the bachelor for one the movie approach is interesting and not dripping with clich another is the colorful cast donnell and zellweger are cute together and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in it own mediocrity ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure and james cromwell is sincere and effective as wise priest dragged through jimmie marital adventures and now the cons the approach may be interesting but in trying an old fashioned method director gary sinyor gives the film synthetic feel the characters are drawn with obvious broad strokes and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable yes `the bachelor is far more frustrating than cute the screenplay is lamely written and the subject matter poorly conceived the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted along with whatever promise the film initially contained potential goes out the window early to suit sinyor `colorful approach but not minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director wishes `the bachelor becomes lost without homing beacon to save it you ve seen the tv spots haven you donnell is madly rushing down deserted street and the caption reads `what is this man running from in actuality he fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune it one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film after seeing the movie believe that the approaching horde could be something else donnell could be running from his angry fans who have just endured `the bachelor and are hunting him down for revenge
wizards is an animated feature that begins with narration of epic proportions over siyah and beyaz drawings we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation induced mutation the original inhabitants of the earth fairies and elves return to populate the globe along with their evil mutant counterparts one day and say one day not to be trite but because that exactly how it happened no advance notice fairy queen gives birth to twins one good and one evil the twins grow up to be powerful wizards the good one embracing magic and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology as unoriginal as the premise is was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out there lot you can do in an animated fantasy world after all soon learned however that the fantasy was the expectation of decent film once the transition was made from still art to color animation an entirely different feel takes precedence rather than the epic saga promised by the narration we get goofy looking world of saturday morning cartoon not just the look mind you but all the zany sounds like >honk boing for years blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined however blackwolf now has secret weapon nazis yup adolf hitler the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht okay not the real things but an archival film his minions dug up projected into the sky for all to see it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up before you know it there are dead elves everywhere this is just as well the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn care about any of them they re either silly sappy or both the dialog gets much of the credit for this an example is when avatar nonchalantly says well looks like my brother and begin our final battle not very formidable when he also the guy who says this is the biggest bummer of trip ve ever been on my favorite line was from sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can fight back against the nazi charged evil her response is they have weapons and technology we just have love suffice to say the characters are strictly two dimensional and we therefore don expect anything more than the obvious to happen which it does the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out which is anticlimactic and disappointing please note that it is the action that is unexpected that it is disappointing is not the film couldn settle on particular mood it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity the dramatics which seem to occur at random are overly staged and overly acted detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned ralph bakshi the director makes an obvious attempt to get message across in this film hitler and the nazis were bad so who doesn know this already well maybe children okay so you might say that this is movie for children it not in the scenes where good fights evil there lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they re watching cartoon so is the film for adults if so we probably don need to be bashed over the head to get the point why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know wizards gives us lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes and hitler giving speeches however we don see any reason why they should be considered bad we see no atrocities being committed not even any real battle footage there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich and we re not even given cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place this needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if point were to be made since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere at any time and we must therefore be vigilant however not sure if want to give him that much credit

first impressions critically close to awful film but money wise it has been doing and will continue to do great sometimes funny film that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring an orginal plot that grows old real fast one of the only 90 minute films that ve gotten bored through men in siyah has defied the odds when first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long thought maybe that this was poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas however now realize that not only did men in siyah run out of gas but the film in 90 minutes manages to show off very original idea which summer audiences have embraced that becomes old about 25 minutes into the movie tommy lee jones and will smith play two government agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society the ridiculous plot begins when an alien bug played weirdly by vincent onofrio who was so great in full metal jacket lands on earth to retrieve galaxy that somewhere on orion belt anyway the basic plot revolves around jones and smith to stop this bug from getting the galaxy or higher power will blow up the earth the premise is ridulous but that is not why didn like this film love original plots this one had an original one but director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films whenever saw onofrio bug stomp and eat people in the film it got terribly boring after while while smith wise cracks did fill in the gaps it wasn enough and also cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have sub plot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent they can have contact with any humans really and here see jones at satellite computer watching his lover plant the garden sentimental moment in an alien movie nice try but don think so it doesn work here it just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring we don only have aliens to worry about but now we have jones conscience came into the movie not wanting to see jones conscience but wanting to see real action movie that had lots of aliens in it maybe it unfair that partly judged this movie on what my expectations were nevertheless even though some parts are indeed funny the plot in this movie grew old and boring quick
in my review of the spy who shagged me postulated an unbreakable law of film physics every time sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series it is followed by third movie that is bore the cause is probably complacency studio sighs with relief when part lives up to expectations and figures part is sure thing scream provides the latest proof of this rule in los angeles production has begun on stab return to woodsboro the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott neve campbell however life soon starts imitating art and stab cast members turn up stabbed smelling yet another book deal gale weathers courteney cox arquette comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex boyfriend dewey riley david arquette acting as technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer parker posey the actress playing gale in stab elsewhere our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name until she gets phone call from familiar evil voice the late randy meeks jamie kennedy makes surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of trilogy he notes the third chapter in trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and huge backstory to contend with indeed scream tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all the murder of sidney mother maureen before the beginning of the original scream at the scene of each murder in scream the killer leaves photo of sidney mother maureen as teenager in hollywood and even includes note claiming to be her real killer to find out who the killer is our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen missing years when she was starlet appearing in low budget horror films even with that little information you can probably already guess what the killer relationship to sidney is unlike its predecessors scream doesn have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped so that by the end we don even care who the killer is the jaded detective patrick dempsey the kinky producer lance henriksen the driven young director scott foley the ingenue emily mortimer the character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one secret so it quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen the series trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious possibly it the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson who penned the first two or maybe it that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes cliche groaned as an attack on sidney from the first scream was repeated moment for moment in the hollywood set of her home at some point referencing becomes just means to cover up poverty of new ideas scream also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles look for jenny mccarthy carrie fisher patrick warburton puddy from seinfeld roger corman and jason mewes and kevin smith as jay and silent bob to walk through at some point all these bit players put forth more effort than the series returning stars who are probably saving their energy for the long post scream job search another prediction made in previous review has come to pass more movies are copying the blair witch project web strategy scream has three official websites that wink wink pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie the sunrise studios site scream3 com has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the latest stab news there also gail weathers official site galeweathers com and sunrise sucks site that has more stab scandals the studio wants to cover up sunrisesucks com craven and company promise that this is the last installment in the scream series while hope that true don hold out much hope horror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters there halloween h2k in the works even though michael myers was beheaded in h20 and freddy vs jason has been talked about for awhile despite the fact that both characters were killed off there bound to be scream someday even if it starts over with new set of movie star wannabes bottom line they should have called this one yawn
breakdown is an moderately entertaining if underwhelming thriller kurt russell and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff and amy taylor taking the scenic route to california through redneck country however while in the middle of nowhere their jeep decides to break down leaving them stranded friendly truck driver warren walsh offers to give them lift to town although jeff rejects the offer he wants to stay with his car amy agrees hops into warren lorry and promptly disappears jeff wonders where the hell she is and when he later catches up with warren and warren says he has never seen amy in his life the plot thickens and jeff goes on chase to find his wife although comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance 1972 and the vanishing 1993 plot wise the latter two are far superior character and script wise kurt russell is as jeff although he can seemingly only pull of one expression which is angry throughout the whole film he looks angry or just pissed off quinlan is again but again she can only pull off one expression which is looking dorky throughout the whole film she looks dorky walsh who sadly recently passed away is fine as warren who we soon find out is kidnapper although his actual character is pretty weak and not really menacing enough the supporting cast do their best aswell with rex linn as doubting sheriff and the other kidnappers the story written by first timer jonathan mostow who also directs is if surprisingly familiar and sometimes extraordinarily stupid some of the things the characters do in this movie is beyond the bounds of idiocy there are some flaws with the plot also as the characters do the complete opposite to logical presumably to keep the story exciting and also the fact that the story just isn strong enough to sustain the audience attention the picture moves along very slowly also it almost threatens to drop dead the picture does pick up towards the end but by then it too late mostow directs the action sequences well enough however the film doesn really come to satisfying conclusion either the ending tries to be bleak but just comes off annoying breakdown could of been far more enjoyable picture had it had stronger cast and director instead it just turns out to be merely average missed opportunity overall rating= review by david wilcock
the last of vampire films offers plenty of blood and gore but beyond that nothing jack crow james woods is professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican his and his men mission is to clean the earth from vampires they have lost count of how many vampires they have slaughtered but one has always escaped them valek thomas ian griffith the dark messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation the siyah cross with the cross in their possesion the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth have never liked john carpenter and his style after seeing this film my opinions have not changed john carpenter remains john carpenter however because of the film self irony siyah humour and fascinating cinematography would say that it is his greatest achievement in long long time neither the synopses or carpenter direction are original but there are some things that are interesting the director negative view on the catholic church for instance at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba maximilian schell has simply used crow and his team to find valek so that he would gain eternal life otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool drinking smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere set in new mexican dessert he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness more than anything in this film this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil the cinematography by gary kibbe is probably the film greatest achievement music composed by john carpenter himself is at times effective the special effects and makeup are likewise worth notice when it comes to the cast in an intellectual film like this casting is the last problem everyone can scream and swing the axe but here james woods is suprisingly convincing he is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter who lost his family to the breed of evil woods is constantly overacting which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self importance daniel baldwin is also entertaining as crow loyal partner the other cast members are struggling because the film doesn take itself too seriously it stays afloat still it is like most vampire films mediocre experience
arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts since the late 80 but lately his films have been very sloppy and the one liners are getting worse it hard seeing arnold as mr freeze in batman and robin especially when he says tons of ice jokes but hey he got 15 million what it matter to him once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster that can compare with the likes of the terminator series true lies and even eraser in this so called dark thriller the devil gabriel byrne has come upon earth to impregnate woman robin tunney which happens every 1000 years and basically destroy the world but apparently god has chosen one man and that one man is jericho cane arnold himself with the help of trusty sidekick kevin pollack they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world parts of this are actually so absurd that they would fit right in with dogma yes the film is that weak but it better than the other blockbuster right now sleepy hollow but it makes the world is not enough look like star film anyway this definitely doesn seem like an arnold movie it just wasn the type of film you can see him doing sure he gave us few chuckles with his well known one liners but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going it understandable especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources aside form that he still walked through it much like he has in the past few films sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days speaking of action where was it in this film there was hardly any explosions or fights the devil made few places explode but arnold wasn kicking some devil butt the ending was changed to make it more spiritual which undoubtedly ruined the film was at least hoping for cool ending if nothing else occurred but once again was let down also don know why the film took so long and cost so much there was really no super affects at all unless you consider an invisible devil who was in it for minutes tops worth the overpriced budget the budget should have gone into better script where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom it pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into movie do they even read these things anymore it sure doesn seem like it thankfully gabriel performance gave some light to this poor film when he walks down the street searching for robin tunney you can help but feel that he looked like devil the guy is creepy looking anyway when it all over you re just glad it the end of the movie don bother to see this if you re expecting solid action flick because it neither solid nor does it have action it just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing due to strategic marketing campaign save your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience
capsule this super light situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems the script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not lot different from what is shown free on television the characters are paper thin and the interesting ideas purely non existent this is decrement life by 90 minutes card to +4 jalla jalla is basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen it tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love the film is set in sweden where roro and mans fares fares and torkel petersson are custodians at public park roro is from tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely mans is swede from much more liberal background they spend most of the day in the bushes at their park cleaning up after dogs roro and mans each have girlfriends but each has problem roro nicknamed jalla is having family problems it seems that his family wants to arrange marriage between him and nice lebanese woman yasmin laleh pourkarim but he is already in love with lisa tuva novotny yasmin likes roro but does not want to get married either mans on the other hand has been having problem of sexual impotence the two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other mans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers the one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them roro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other but then plan to break up before the wedding not too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected the plot turns in several places are contrived one knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen lebanese born josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps better director than he is writer when things start to get slow he just adds throws in another story for example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and long chase is added to the film characterization is little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing biological function we do see some of roro family life and his concerns that may be because roro background is lot like that of the director while the story was entertaining did not feel that got anything worthwhile from the film it was just way to pass about an hour and half in my life one does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this rate it on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale
mandingo has traditionally been seen as one of two things either much needed revisionist look at slavery in the south or in the words of film critic leonard maltin trashy potboiler that appeals only to the s&m crowd actually think mandingo is strange combination of the two although it fails on both fronts it too trashy to be good drama but too dramatic to be good trash the story takes place on dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell james mason and his son hammond perry king one day in new orleans hammond comes across slave trader selling mandingo named mede heavyweight boxer ken norton although the movie never explains it mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley according to the movie mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him hammond then spends his time training mede to be fighter in money brawls with other slaves meanwhile hammond has married his cousin blanche susan george because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce grandchild hammond however is happier spending nights with his bed wench the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex it is quickly apparent that hammond despite his overt racism is more in love with his bed wench sensitive slave girl named ellen brenda sykes than he is with blanche hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had pleasured her before he did of course it fine that he slept with numerous slave girls but the fact that his wife beyaz lady had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her so blanche is usually left lonely and sex starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to half black child although it okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth and hammond poisons blanche hammond then finds mede shoots him twice in the shoulder and pushes him into giant cauldron of boiling water yes you read right the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive judging only by the plot mandingo is pure sexploitation the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society when mandingo was released in 1975 it was still bit of shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such graphic detail this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs dramatically mandingo is weak and unfocused and historically it mostly confused if one were to judge history by this film it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality not economics not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working except for few house servants the men spend most of the time sitting around while the sole purpose of female slave seems to be free sex for the owner there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves but mandingo overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of cheap sex flick although there plenty of violence fights vicious beatings shootings and the aforementioned human boiling sequence thrown in for good measure some tried to write off mandingo as blaxploitation film one of number of quickly made low budget films appealing to siyah sensibilities in the early seventies but it not that easy mandingo was studio financed by paramount pictures and produced by dino de laurentiis the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as the bible 1966 the remake of king kong 1976 and the ill fated dune 1984 the director was richard fleischer veteran who was best known for several special effects laden action movies including 20 000 leagues under the sea 1954 and fantastic voyage 1966 as well as such superior suspense films as the narrow margin 1952 the script based on the supermarket best seller by ken ostott and the subsequent play by jack kirkland was penned by norman wexler who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on serpico james mason perry king and susan george were well known and respected actors mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt and ken norton appeared to have promising film career so why is mandingo so bad number of reasons including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did lousy job wexler script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive it combines stereotyped slave talk yessuh massuh stereotyped southern beyaz trash talk fer whut re you gittin outta bed and stereotyped contemporary militant siyah talk if you see me hang you gonna know you killed siyah brother fleischer direction is clumsy especially during the fight scenes and all the actors give weak performances especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable nevertheless credit should be given where credit is due despite its exploitative nature mandingo was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery until then there had been kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery even classics such as gone with the wind 1939 can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter mandingo reassessed the south and showed that it wasn all beautiful plantations green fields and pretty sunsets but all this is constantly undermined by the film negligible point of view it claims to see things from the siyah perspective but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the beyaz owners with little more maturity and different handling mandingo might have been an effective worthwhile film while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery it never deals with them the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile but wexler script refuses to move them beyond surface level of trashily vicarious viewing there is great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of sexual relationship between slave and owner but mandingo never does it steven spielberg touched on that same topic in schindler list 1993 by looking at nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for jewish maid the difference between that film and mandingo is that spielberg dealt with the situation in fair unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma mandingo is satisfied to simply show some skin and because of that its trashy potboiler nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished
ladybugs is typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees the pathetic team who beats the champs cross dressing and the presence of rodney dangerfield this picture doesn play like comedy for children so who is it aimed at and why is it told like 91 minute sit com instead of feature film rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee total schmuck working at huge corporation he obviously doesn have lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead which he does by volunteering to coach the company girls soccer team what shock to learn chester and his assistant julie jackee know absolutely nothing about the game and the players seem to know even less didn laugh but for some reason it didn annoy me that much chester fiancee bess graff thinks he got promotion in addition to the coaching position and of course she has slacker for son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams jonathon brandis is nice surprise as matthew who agrees to dress up as girl named martha to help out chester probably because the girl he has crush on plays on the team what original story ideas what we get is just another retread of the underdog sports team mixed with some cross dressing unfortunately the film isn smart enough to play upon the drag aspect in fact it downplays it so heavily it totally unbelievable could it be any more obvious martha is boy he only wears girl wig without any makeup and they don even give him falsies brandis doesn bother to mimic girl voice either then there is pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for dress but for what reason martha is only seen on the soccer field why would they buy dress for her just when we think the martha character is going to be useful she disappears and the story wanders aimlessly looking for new plot to pick up on when bess discovers what really going on she breaks up with chester and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss this film could ve been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary and bad at that there just too much of sit com feel here especially during the so called serious moments and all the confusion between the characters ve seen worse movies than ladybugs but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm so even when it turns sour it doesn seem as bad as it is dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end but at what price
the happy bastard quick movie review the concept of enjoying stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid really shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control sadly that is the case with kingpin film directed by the farrelly brothers the duo that brought us there something about mary and dumb and dumber since the duo directed and didn write the script can assume that part of the problem the story seems good enough pro bowler in the 1970 by the name of roy munson woody harrelson is sitting on top of the world his popularity has gone through the roof and he getting his career off the ground then however he runs into ed mccracken bill murray rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for well anything these two form an ill timed relationship that involves risky betting and before roy sees it coming ed abandoned him and he about to lose his hand in bowling ball machine forward seventeen years later where roy has become quite the loser complete with mechanical hand torn up car and of course the occasional knocking up of the ugly ass landlord to avoid paying rent for while however he finds glimmer of hope upon visit to local bowling alley where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael randy quaid who has quite the bowling arm with the kid help he figures he can be known again particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno nevada of course the amish kid needs some coaxing particularly when you consider well he amish this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film such as roy process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow finally the duo get on the road and along the way pick up an additional helper beautiful hustler played by the gorgeous vanessa angel the main problem had with kingpin wasn the fact it wasn funny in fact it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it such as the aformentioned above and roy explanation of not having children something involving cheese grater but that just it scenes there couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex boyfriend mean was this really necessary couldn have this been handled just bit wackier mean this is comedy why throw ethics in particularly in farrelly brothers vehicle where hair gel can be easily mistaken that really ruined it however and that too bad the acting is top notch especially from angel and murray and the really funny scenes are worth noting still if you re going to think dumb think dumb all the way through ok at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or still be little bit irked
retrospective city of the living dead 1980 film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as dim witted and by golly just about all other words fail me when confronted with dog like city of the living dead although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career this is not one of them two points in the movie favour the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi keep things from falling totally into the abyss but by and large city of the living dead is failure and like most cinematic failures it comes down to bad writing dumb performances and lousy direction the story starts in new york when during seance medium katherine mccoll sees vision of priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich massachusetts for reasons we won go into here this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by crusty old journalist christopher george that scene in itself is howler why would you bust open coffin with large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside and don cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they re buried anyway off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world where various grisly goings on are already happening as all saints day approaches fulci graphic gore is in evidence once again but here it only serves to further highlight the film flimsy script and plodding direction the dialogue in all manner of speaking is unspeakable not bad in the quotable sense like an ed wood film but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious lets explain the plot type approach mccoll doesn have clue who her character is deadly serious one minute frivolous the next she at times is genuinely hard to watch and the geezer the actor name escapes me who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses christopher george performance is salvageable but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by zombie and we don care in fact we don care for anyone in city of the living dead though in other fulci films that hasn mattered so much when he was on form as stylist and an ideas man as he was in the beyond as director some of fulci idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here he constantly uses extreme close ups of people eyes ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors aren capable of and despite some gruesome violence he barely manages single scare in the entire film long time collaborator fabio frizzi talented but always erratic offers patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electro pop that quite frankly embarrassing fulci other films of this period may be flawed house by the cemetery the beyond the siyah cat but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey for completists only
here is movie that sadly follows the hong kong recipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter these kinds of movies are marked by an eye opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters life and death plot in which these characters become involved the inclusion of host of inconsequential characters ridiculous subplots and sunglass wearing henchmen that is not to say that don like hong kong influenced movies however it is quite obvious that these moviemakers haven clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hip hop talking thugs and stupid sight gags observe the opening sequence band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment led by melvin mark wahlberg and cisco lou diamond phillips they are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles however their partner is unsure of which cable to cut he is undecided this happens for about 10 seconds the audience finds some humor in his foolishness the lights suddenly go out cisco is surprised and says whoa let go and they storm the apartment in very nicely executed sequence the big hit of the title refers to kidnapping that happens quarter of the way through the film needing cash cisco devises plan to kidnap the daughter china chow of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi however the daughter is also the god daughter of paris avery brooks who is cisco and melvin boss infuriated and insufferable paris commands cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping during his investigation cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader and paris orders his capture and execution melvin must now find way to stay alive by the way do you know how the investigation takes place cisco partner makes the ransom phone call believing that his call will not be traced because of trace buster that prevents tracing but mr nishi has trace buster buster to counter that cisco partner has trace buster buster buster but nishi has trace buster buster buster buster and so on there is no doubt that this is an interesting world in which they live and there are lots of issues that we like to know more about how does melvin justify his profession to his fiancee what goes on among this clique why is cisco at odds with melvin there is actually lot of potential material that could have been explored but it seems that no effort is made to go in that direction and instead we are given not so engrossing plot filled with one liners silly sight gags extraneous sub plots and tomfoolery and haven even mentioned his financee visiting parents who want them to separate nor melvin mistress nor the pimple faced video clerk demanding the return of an overdue video and on and on and on if the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences then shoot me now
call hush stop or my mom will kill or mommy fearest or the hand that robs the cradle call it whatever you want but certainly don see it unless you re in desperate need of bad movie induced chuckle hush scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as guilty pleasure chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post production tinkering it was supposed to open about year ago the latter of which appears to have given hush send off that downright infuriating it too bad that hush is so laughable because the on screen talent including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange is nothing to laugh at paltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson photogenic new york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy well to do family horse farm estate kilronan jackson mother martha lange runs kilronan all by herself and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether caught red handed after bedroom romp with her husband to be but it seems that martha friendly smile masks much more threatening demeanor she what you call someone who loves too much martha eagerly deviously wants grandchild and then helen will be expendable as far as she concerned if there one reason to catch hush it lange she treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated injecting martha poorly written though she may be with little empathy to level out the psycho playing field when she delves into martha dark side predictable cliches chain smoking staring in mirrors praying in confessional to priest who isn there poking hole in helen diaphragm so she ll become pregnant and she does abound but it moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch veteran performer nina foch is smart and tart as jackson wheelchair bound paternal grandmother the rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable especially paltrow but can you really blame them the character relationships in hush hold certain amount of promise at least until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity idiotic situations martha yells at nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock helen over compliment idiotic dialogue why did you yell helen yells back at martha and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blank from hell flicks ever made you can see through great deal of martha actions and lies from their conception why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out does nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town if any of her potential victims thought acted or behaved like normal people hush would be really short movie and then there the climax and ending which abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with labor inducing drug normally used on horses after really weird chase scene martha calmly knits in rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in bed all by herself won spoil what happens next except to say that it contradictory illogical and probably since no doctor medically impossible the final scene offers no closure no resolution no confrontation whatsoever it just there dangling amidst silent displeasure no one should like this ending regardless of their feelings on the preceding material perhaps hush title is plea to silence its audience likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater
there nothing quite like gory anime really and this is the truth no other genre in film gets away with such violence without word being said in the media about it with anime common shot is watching body getting quickly cut in two and the rest of the insides falling out seconds afterword this is standard practice in anime or at least the half dozen or so titles that ve seen vampire hunter is gory gory film if they ever made live version of the film it would be banned in several countries and given rating somewhere below xxx it not that it gore is unique it just like other gory animes but this one was supposed to stand out because of the complexity it story characters animation etc it really didn it was disgusting and gruesome which overshadowed the story what little of it there was it seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the world because god knows that our local police force just can seem to get handle on vampires in the movies one evening blond peasant girl drawn to look 17 and innocent foreshadow that we will see her naked guessed early on it would be in the shower or in rape scene is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of ten thousand year old vampire insert strom thurmand joke here of course he never put no trespassing sign on his yard so one can really blame her but he upset anyway and demands retribution she gets the obligatory bite on the neck aren there other places to get blood from it seems like bite in the elbow would do well enough if it good enough for doctors to draw blood from then why do vampires stray from that sight to fight the spell she enlists the help of mysteriously tall dark and handsome vampire hunter you guessed it his name is the vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires being attracted to the 17 year old peasant girl and finding reasons not to talk too much you see like all heroes in these kinds of stories he brooder who sole purpose in life is to remain really really silent when he speaks it in cliches heroes like this are bad when they re live even worse when animated later the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire who wants to marry the peasant girl because he bored after 10 000 years of living the only clever vampire insight made in the movie will vampire hunter rush to save her in time will we see blood and intestines spattering on every place imaginable in it defense the animation when focusing on being original rather than recycling anime slicing could at times be original the talking hand was clever and think the inspiration for skateboard related logo and that the best defense can think of understand that vampire hunter is supposed to be fave among anime fans but really don see it it an excuse to watch blood dripping from teeth blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks and most importantly like all violent anime it is an excuse to see animated breasts why what is the point of that maybe have to understand the genre and look past the obsessive gore and mysogny not prude just don think it warranted it puts itself so far out in front of the movie that everything else gets lost is there neccesity in seeing 17 year old in the shower of course not it done for shock it tasteless and despicable

even though have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor his presence in motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality like everyone else dreyfuss has bills to pay so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies consequently while his career highlights include jaws close encounters of the third kind stakeout and tin men his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador let it ride and now krippendorf tribe let me start out by saying that krippendorf tribe is occasionally funny although never riotously so but that about its only asset the best word to describe this film is asinine the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes which are aimed at someone going through puberty krippendorf tribe tries to be zany off the wall comedy but the film makers have forgotten three important rules the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist the second is that viewers should be able to identify with or at least care about character or two finally and most importantly more than 5% of the jokes have to work once upon time james krippendorf dreyfuss was respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college he and his wife obtained grant to seek out lost tribe somewhere in the wilds of new guinea goal which they never accomplished shortly after their return from the failed trip krippendorf wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children shelly natasha lyonne mickey gregory smith and edmund carl michael linder on his own now over year later the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf which he has spent not on research but on things for his family so they send new member of their faculty professor veronica micelli jenna elfman to inform him that he has been scheduled to give lecture on his findings when he arrives at the college for the momentous event rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds he fabricates tale about mythical lost tribe the shelmikedmu to provide video footage he films his children dressed in native garb soon much to krippendorf surprise the shelmikedmu are national phenomenon but one disaffected professor lily tomlin is determined to prove that the tribe is fraud the only way krippendorf tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters not to mention the viewers are dumber than dirt unfortunately it impossible to like or sympathize with bunch of putzes like this director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than device to implement various dubious gags meanwhile attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend come across as feeble and derivative the acting in underwhelming dreyfuss has definitely not given his all to the role of james krippendorf alongside him jenna elfman the spunky co star of tv dharma and greg radiates perkiness and little else this quality while fine for 22 minute television program quickly becomes irritating in the arena of feature length movie no one in the supporting cast lily tomlin david ogden stiers natasha lyonne woody allen daughter in everyone says love you excels know that movie in trouble when it half the length of titanic but seems much longer most of what comes on screen is generic sit com level material the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set if there any upside it that don see much box office support developing for this lame ill marketed miscue krippendorf tribe will quickly become extinct
movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting entertaining or convincing because of one fundamental reason movies are made by adults and not teenagers occasionally however films like say anything dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called teenagers can hardly wait however does not instead the writing directing team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich found in the teenage genre strip it completely of perception intelligence and wit and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences have ever been subjected to can hardly wait follows group of characters as they attend house party on the night of their high school graduation the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them there the average male protagonist preston ethan embry prom queen and cheerleader amanda jennifer love hewitt football star mike peter facinelli beyaz rapper wannabe kenny seth green computer geek william charlie korsmo and brainy outsider denise lauren ambrose couldn stand any of those characters whether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming yo gotta have sex tonight all could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film apparently can hardly wait is supposed to be comedy but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it not funny in all honesty elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour and when say forced mean it they should be strapped down to chair and have their eyes wedged open in similar fashion to alex in clockwork orange this is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour for instance can hardly wait features foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as am sex machine for some reason elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough eventually it will be funny if only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk now that funny
arriving in barrage of hype the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year however like the golden child although blair witch has made lot of money it not very good donahue williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make documentary about the blair witch myth the film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles although events start of normal they get weird pretty quickly while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on although an interesting premise the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than missed opportunity the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise most of the dialogue is ad libbed and still manages to sound like poor movie the script eventually degenerates into shouting matches with the word included lot to sound like students there are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur but then it back to the shouting and swearing which gets very tiresome very quickly if wanted to see three people get lost in the woods shout lot and swear go on scout camp but no the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this but not quite sure how the supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes with no music and no budget to work with the film has to depend on natural psychological scares which are sometimes well delivered sometimes not never really felt truly scared during any part of the film although there is small sense of fear underlying throughout the film however because the actors are so irritating the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying what the ck is that lot and mike giggling like loony there also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things the main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment and are hopelessly lost heather still insists on filming it all the film gives half hearted reason why she should want to do this but it isn very convincing also the students have no idea how to survive in the woods such as following large river flowing through the woods to civilisation there are also some parts where the amateur camcorder footage is obviously staged heather apology being major one the blair witch project in the end just fails to deliver suppose if you ve been lost camping before the film may deliver some chills but this is no use for the other 99% of the paying audience who haven been lost in the woods apart from the final minutes the film is mind boggingly unscary and the shouting matches get hideously dull the spook scenes are short and far between and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide although good idea it not executed well enough to be fun scary cinema experience it worrying fact when the website http www blairwitch com is better than the film
an attempt at florida film noir palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels it slow moving uninvolving and plain just uninteresting harry barber woody harrelson is an ex newspaper man just out of jail after being framed for crime his luck hasn been the best but things are looking up when mysterious woman rhea malroux elisabeth shue approaches him with proposition she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter odette chloe sevigny pull off fake kidnapping scheme to get $500 000 out of her stingy but rich husband felix rolf hoppe at first all harry is expected to do is provide threatening voice on the phone and to collect the money of which he gets to keep 10% but as the deed is carried out things are not what they seem and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve film noir film but the effect never quite comes together it got the sultry florida heat seductive women and even curvier plot twists but the whole thing smells of paint by numbers sure the right ingredients are there but the end result is much too artificial lot of the problems lie with the script which though providing some genuine surprises is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations even the plot twists don seem to flow well with the rest of the story some of them for example come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed twist for example harry spontaneous job offer or the whole typewriter situation the characters are mostly lifeless played to type but not much more woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick headedness that it hard to even picture him as an ex journalist elisabeth shue vamps it up but doesn add anything special to the role chloe sevigny gives terrible performance trying to be sexy 17 year old but she just leaves bad taste in your mouth some of the supporting cast notably gina gershon and michael rapaport give stronger but in the end meaningless performances and to top it off the pacing of the film is much too slow as the movie grinds to halt you re given too much time to wonder why you re wasting it watching palmetto if you re in the mood for this type of movie you be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir
the blues brothers was wonderful film hilarious comedy packed with good music it cried out for sequel but john belushi untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea however eighteen years have passed and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged unfortunately it sequel not worthy of the original the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended elwood blues dan aykroyd is just getting out of jail his brother jake having recently died as in the first film he first visits mother mary stigmata kathleen freeman and then sets about getting the band back together john belushi absence leaves terrible hole in the film and although three new characters are created to fill the void it is still very noticeable first there cabel joe morton the illegitimate son of elwood stepfather played by cab calloway in the first movie cabel is reluctant to join his destiny and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff chasing the blues brothers band next there mighty mack john goodman bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band finally there buster evan bonifant ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band the plotting of the film is hardly original it seems to be almost clone of the original elwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band they then travel while being pursued by the police and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale the first film had neo nazis as the random element this time around the russian mafia and militia group fill their role in fact the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original remember the classic performance at country bob where they like both types of music country and western from the first movie well this movie has performance at country fair where the band is expected to play bluegrass music there the massive police car pileup although this time the gag falls completely flat there even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus james brown there are plenty of recurring characters too in addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs murphy frank oz prison guard in the first film makes an appearance here as the prison warden as the stars the new blues brothers don live up to their legacy aykroyd is more loquacious yet much flatter as elwood john goodman barely has character as mighty mack joe morton has the deepest character but not terribly interesting one as cab and what the deal with the orphan it plays like desperate gimmick that doesn mesh at all with the rest of the film at least bonifant isn as precocious as he could have been in the role but the true star and the only saving grace of the film is the music and the film is packed with it even during and after the ending credits although there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the original rawhide stand by your man medley the music is very much enjoyable to top it off the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances king blues traveler eric clapton travis tritt wilson pickett erykah badu bo diddley and steve winwood are just sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here and there unfortunately the music pauses here and there to allow in the familiar plot if simply copying the original blues brothers wasn bad enough writers aykroyd and john landis dumb it down removing any memorable characters and replacing them with flashy but unbelievable magical gimmicks it shame buy the soundtrack and avoid the film better yet rewatch the original you ll have much better time
plunkett macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott brother of ridley and tony naturally this got me worried would jake talent be inherited from ridley or tony if it was from ridley than the movie would be thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in if it was from tony it would be wham bang drivel unfortunately the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm carlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen plunkett carlyle who is poor and unruly and captain james macleane miller clean cut gentleman as the tagline clearly wants to make known they rob the rich and nothing else the film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca tyler hot on both their tails is mr chance ken stott who wants to see them both dead plunkett macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose although undoubtedly slick and fast paced there very little merit contained in the film carlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair although their characters are criminally undeveloped it appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes but not on the script the five screenwriters three credited have produced an still born movie there very little development in the story also major events such as mr cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are are so rushed that they barely happened the story is bit of mess frankly the performances aren bad carlyle and miller are typical lads but liv tyler is huge disappointment as the love interest her irritable stilted performance sticks out like sore thumb and was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on she looks nice though more interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester and although his character amounts to nothing more than two dimensional comedy gay character he hams it up well ken stott is suitably evil as chance but again he is nothing but flat character didn particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived although disappointment in writing and minor success in acting the film certainly look lavish with good costumes and wonderful sets but production design alone can save movie especially movie as bad as this mess jake scott would be more suited to directing music video rather than this failed update of period drama the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty with ck this and stand and cking deliver splattered all over the place the mtv editing and direction are flash enough but in the end decidedly empty plunkett macleane is massive disappointment although somewhat enjoyable during parts it so light it could float off the screen if it wasn just images on reel there no thought no development no plot just series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to gen xers although it great idea update period drama to the mtv generation it execution is awful and would more likely bore than excite sloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless it hard to recommend plunkett macleane as movie but easy to recommend it as overlong music video give it miss
terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones world war ii novel unfortunately he buried it within an overlong and overreaching hour long pseudo epic this is shame because the film features an outstanding performance by nick nolte the best scene is when nick nolte character lt col tall is forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt staros elias koteas to execute an order nolte reaction and transformation may be the best work of his career had terrence malick concentrated on the great performances of nolte and koteas as well as those by sean penn woody harrelson and john cusack he could have made truly great film instead malick saddled the film with plodding pacing unnecessary flashbacks and voice over narration all designed to telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the story the narration was especially annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry with lot of editing the core story could be transformed into truly classic war film hopefully the dvd version of this film will feature options to suppress the narration and perhaps will even provide for an alternate shorter version of the film give this film
one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself such was the case with boxing helena 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch daughter of the great david lynch made in the dying years of post twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs it was hyped as another warped twisted masterpiece of lynch clan kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract but the result was extremely disappointing film which quickly sank into well deserved oblivion the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh played by julian sands talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena sherilyn fenn beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re establish the relationship during one of such occasions helena is hit by car and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her after she wakes up helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh stylish residence but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping she is still trying to escape so cavanaugh takes off her arms apart from casting sherilyn fenn audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies this film by ms lynch hasn got anything in common with the works of director more talented father despite rather bizarre subject the style of this film is conventional and setting is light characters are beautiful but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos the actors aren good either julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains being neurotic doesn suit him bill paxton was better for this role but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena boyfriend sherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks but even the her greater effort in acting couldn help this film the screenplay on the other hand is awful at least for someone who had made best seller with laura palmer diary the events in this movie are implausible characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion one of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh regular girlfriend played by betsy clarke the twist at the end although unpredictable is unbelievable and the viewers who had the stomach to endure entire film would feel cheated all in all boxing helena is disorganised quasi artistic mess of movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basinger career
let get this one over with as quickly as possible if there was possibility to receive refund this review would not be forthcoming but as it is godzilla is without doubt the loudest longest and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through major studio producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch last year at merienbad until they can grasp the idea of content and plot no amount of hype no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine billy the kid vs dracula godzilla opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs we are then introduced to the crew of japanese fish canning ship questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins well the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature later group of frenchmen led by philippe roache jean reno interview the sole survivor in state of shock the only thing the man can utter is the word gojira the japanese name of the famed beast we are then introduced to dr nick tatopoulos matthew broderick with moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population he is immediately drafted by the military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of creature in short amount of time another fishing boat loaded with canned tuna from the and korea for some reason is found grounded in jamaica well it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york when the beast finally appears he tears up one building stomps couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert thumbs up for new york the military with dr tatopoulos help have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has cute face to face with dr tatopoulos who snaps the beast picture the monster eats the fish the military starts shooting and the chase is on with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage working from hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple dr totopoulos buys few home pregnancy kits from local drugstore that has chosen to remain open even though new york has been evacuated well the test proves that the monster is hermaphrodite and is pregnant needless to say no one believes the good doctor about his discovery so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city even though the monster isn dead yet sincerely hope that ve completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film gave away the relevant plot so that could spare those of you courageous or foolish enough to drop down an hour wage on this tripe everything about godzilla reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast the script and let be clear here by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years razzie award the dialogue between maria pitillo as audrey timmonds dr tatopoulos estranged girlfriend and mr broderick is so adolescent it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief as happened during the screening witnessed the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn take itself so damn seriously but to what end as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind no godzilla is just big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it the film is bleak and ugly looking taking place at night during rain storm the movie has little or no depth everything is ugly and dark new york has never looked so inhospitable since death wish in an attempt to give the film some color audrey timmonds carries bright kirmizi umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue the only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica where dr tatopoulos finds himself standing in giant footprint the scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up you know from the outset that nick is standing in footprint for scientist this is very poor observation let look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film this activity is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs and how do those eggs fuse into one beast why would cold blooded creature choose cold climate such as new york to nest don think iguana have habit of migrating how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system slice submarine in half yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin in comparison steel cable on the brooklyn bridge the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it suspension cables did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly if so then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures note each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide godzilla would have to be over 000 feet tall to carry them all godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters but new york cabs are made of stronger steel godzilla can out maneuver helicopters bullets torpedoes and missiles but can catch you on foot taxis can out maneuver godzilla godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can tear through the park avenue tunnel 10 why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla maybe giant hermit crab in the sequel 11 galapagos iguana actually live in the french polynesian islands 12 why was dr tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway 13 how did they evacuate new york island in less than day and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey 14 new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting new yorkers hate beta cam could go on and on but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is don be fooled this film has less gray matter than any episode of america funniest home videos the performances in the film are singularly bland not one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror the characters in the midst of the onslaught have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee failed relationships career choices the only common occurrence that doesn take place here is having one of the characters have bowel movement but then that would have made them believable godzilla for the most part is okay the design of the beast is funky if not very memorable one thing that comes to mind the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark namely his atomic breath now for one can quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait good comparison would be to make superman film and eliminate his ability to fly there is so much wrong with this film that can really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted except for my divorce any film that can have two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac the addition of the baby raptors ah meant godzillas are nothing but direct rip off of jurassic park but with none of that film suspense or tension suffice to say that godzilla is without doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade this is film that needed the hype with the current level of writing and directing nothing else about the film succeeds if you ve seen the trailers you ve seen the best parts my only suggestion for mr and mr is that they could always go back to selling shoes this film could be the next rocky horror only it not funny
vikings bears no this isn the lineup for monday night football rather these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in the 13th warrior film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory based on michael crichton book eaters of the dead this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up sword luckily for the vikings however their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film antonio bandaras is ahmed travelling ambassador accompanied by his friend omar shariff in cameo they eventually come across small viking village we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude they laugh heartily revel in their arrogance and sing songs of battles won but their festivities are about to be halted when messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that great evil is threatening their land help is needed quickly an elderly fortune telling witch arrives after brief incantation she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more not of norse blood are needed to ensure victory personally always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity nonetheless 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives of course during their ride ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors but he ably shows that it not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings but will his skills and that of the group be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside it does not look promising these creatures resembling bears are strong and have high morale they are fearless and display desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods they are ready to sacrifice their lives this is good way to die says one of the fallen warriors despite the larger than life battle sequences was unmoved by the entire experience at many points was even confused for example somewhere in the middle of the film sub plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis however the sub plot never fully materializes and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion there are other questions that had but the real problem was that the story little of it that there was offered no characters to love or hate the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma however banderas role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order also much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night which made battles very difficult to follow would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy as it stands the film manages more confusion than intensity it would make thor cry
wont even pretend that have seen the other alien films saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien but have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies was munching into after hard days work didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after minutes of painful viewing but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning sigourney weaver whos role in alien earned her an academy award nomination plays the character of ripley who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 200 years later scientists use sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley including the alien that was stuck inside her in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two yet ripley is now not completely human possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than normal being im sure someone can explain exactly why this is so but for now well just ignore it and move on why you ask would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated well the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature these were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research they yawn were wrong it doesnt take genius to figure out that the rest of the film is continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un flossed teeth theres little saying that goes something like this if youre going to make bad film do it well have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies but they are not the ones that really bother me alien resurrection good example of film that really gets up my nose is not so much discouraging experience but an off putting one there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore which attempts to distract us from the wandering but not going anywhere plot in one scene my stomach churned as witnessed mawkish looking alien put its hand on characters head and literally ripped most of his face off another one featured ripley sticking knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to fair enough if it were in horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story but this is unfortunately not the case and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable if you think im struggling to find one good aspect about the film then you thought right one exciting scene is credit and the only part remotely worth seeing to the film in which an alien chases two men one cripple up tall ladder with interesting results but of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis so in film where the one liners come as bad as earth man what shit hole and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent its no wonder why alien resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is oh and in case youre wondering about my bag of lollies the less enjoy film the more eat so all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes but however empty the bag turned out to be it was still long way ahead of the movie
love movies really do every time watch great movies like goodfellas 1990 or raiders of the lost ark 1981 tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent skill and entertainment that is on display even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1994 or ghostbusters ii 1988 while not exactly brilliantly well made are certainly not waste of celluloid and present entertainment value then there my favourite martian the exact opposite of what movie should be hurried poorly written and acted movie with one goal to make money disney ever since the lion king 1994 have lost their magic touch but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk christopher lloyd plays martian who crash lands in front of reporter tim hara car daniels and soon tim finds the martian in his home trying to recover and fix his spaceship along with his zoot spacesuit voiced by wayne knight must fix his spaceship before it explodes and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public firstly by hara but later by rival presenter brace channing hurley by calling himself tim uncle martin laughter is supposed to arise from the comical events but never does many bad films have good intentions but my favourite martian doesn appear to try to provide any entertainment filled to the brim with wham bang special effects my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie ve never seen man pull face for 93 minutes until now jeff daniels plays staple nice guy and his role is useless his performance is incredibly lazy although his paperthin character doesn deserve more than the performance he gives darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever but her role is somewhat erm limited hurley mistakes acting for shouting and looking like twit and wins the david wilcock award for most irritating godawful performance in moving picture way to go liz for the supporting cast disney manage to assemble every character actor out there during the film was going he was the guy in ah er before finally giving up and switching off another major setback is the staple comedy sidekick unfortunately the writers sherri stoner and deanna oliver if anyone cares forget that comedy sidekick needs to be funny instead they deliver zoot the martians deeply unfunny sidekick although meant to be manic character no doubt every line that comes out of his neck is dud real dud citizen kane delivers more laughs minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character not one child even bothered to smirk it nice special effect though another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves or rather the lack of them my favourite martian reaches new level of toilet humour it goes past the bowl down the pipe and into the sewer now toilet humour can be funny as dumb and dumber 1994 humorously showed but here characters farting belching and almost getting crapped on literally is not amusing it insulting there one good gag right before the credits but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued either that or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldn mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes yes men at work yowza the fact that lot of money was pumped into this film and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more there are thousands of brilliant films out there that can get distribution yet trash like this gets released nation wide with ease thankfully as soon as it makes it money it will never be seen again and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie down the toilet

by phil curtolo madonna antonio banderas jonathan price in an alan parker film with music from andrew lloyd weber and lyrics by tim rice evita now have to admit the trailer for this rock opera turned major motion picture is almost breath taking for some the soundtrack is wonderful to listen to so why wouldn the movie be wonderful to see simple little over hours of constant singing can almost drive you insane the story of eva duarte madonna evita is full of drama that trapped inside by all the notes and chords she was an orphaned child who ends up becoming hooker then goes into the field of acting and finally meets juan peron price the soon to be first president of argentina they fall in love and eventually marry sounds pretty good doesn it well the story gets better as eva goes on the rainbow tour across europe trying to win respect eva duarte was wonderful lady however all of the drama packed moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood went into theater at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring and left with happy because was right they only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar although it did come off as dull the beautiful cinematography is eye catching as was madonna performance as the spiritual leader of argentina madonna would have definitely been an oscar contender had she spoken single line but her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical film don get me wrong and don look at my grade am not big fan of musicals on the big screen if you re going to pay to see movie you want to see movie now have to admit it lot cheaper to pay $5 than $200 plus to see the play but that what did me in all this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before even saw the movie now you may be saying what kind of critic is he and you re right as critic should have given the movie chance but as 17 year old quentin tarantino fan it was way too hard
to watch `battlefield earth is to wallow in misery it is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history it has clumsily told story insipid dialogue shallow characterizations ugly scene transitions no evidence of dramatic arc headache inducing sound effects and resolution that is completely implausible worse there the promise of sequel why save your money some films go quickly to video this one however should go straight to the sci fi channel `mystery science theatre in the year 3000 man has become an endangered species most of humanity called man animals was destroyed generations ago in battle against race of plundering aliens called psychlos survivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved to mine earth resources for the rest of their lives the aliens are menacing looking humanoid species that stand nine feet tall who resemble inbred klingons dimwitted as they are tall their culture is predicated on power extortion and getting leverage travolta the leverage using star plays terl the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth much of the movie is spent showing us examples of terl petty machinations he routinely employs deception and then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter but one thing is certain he hates being stationed on earth when the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet he begins to devise his latest plan he will select group of slaves to secretly mine out altin ore site it not clear how this benefits terl except that it makes him richer in place where he has no use for it the scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler barry peppers is selected as the slave group leader psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining know how but the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language the principles of our founding fathers euclidean geometry and the location of fort knox this enlightenment just doesn prepare him for the mining assignment it also prepares him to organize and stage massive revolt against their captors `we re going to blow up their home world he says `but first we need few more supplies in days he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling loincloth wearing rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts by now the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl the media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travolta labor of love is piece of sci fi drivel numerous journals have called it an ill conceived idea stemming from blind hubris arrogance and poor planning and after watching this movie you ll wholeheartedly agree this is terrible film that is illogically constructed tediously acted and frequently begs the question why was this ever made at price tag of $90 million this film will be remembered as gigantic folly assuredly becoming `the avengers of this summer both films were unforgivable and this promises to suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity in addition to the universally pejorative reviews there another bizarre element to the `battlefield saga this film would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta who for over decade had been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to the big screen the controversy is that travolta is scientologist and `battlefield is based on 1982 novel by ron hubbard the religion late founder this led some to believe that `battlefield earth would amount to scientologist dogma laden with subliminal messages but the story is so poorly told that any message subliminal or otherwise is totally undetectable if the audience got anything out of this film it was this we are not too unlike the psychlo leader like terl the audience felt imprisoned dreaded their situation and looked for any opportunity to leave could that be the scientology message
you can have any of this it all mine twisted priest charles huevelman hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana angela zimmerly looks on uninterested an evil presence appropriately named the presence dj vivona rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him for kicks the presence likes to trick human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered when something goes wrong and one of the presence recent victims escapes the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is threat that needs to be stopped they enlist the help of alison ramona midgett recent suicide victim to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether realm her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed the king sorcerer amblyn who also lost his job decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice during the downtime in his unemployment amblyn decided to create new dimension where sorcery evil and torture ruled abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love in this new realm amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm after each murder abraham would become stronger until his power surpassed that of amblyn because of the screw up that allowed the recent escape abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself as alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered if there one thing can stand when see film it when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this and now ice from the sun can be added to this list this film is essentially an 80 minute stalk and slash film following the dante inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street through intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and supposedly haunting images many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot if there aren bizarre images floating past the screen then we get pointless shots of suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone compelling but ultimately not the opening credits sequence is designed like music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images the credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesn pop up until near the end of the sequence when the opening credits began thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv at least the music in the film is pretty decent made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features song by ramona midgett at the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them and he talks like darth vader clone without the heavy breathing for some reason though he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance one over alled cretin handles the presence gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel then there an inbred father dwight spurgin and his two inbred children mark kettler and jennifer poirrier wallace that take care of young woman who has been transformed into half dog half human mix with shotgun and of course big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds why would you want to give responsibilities to bunch of rednecks when you yourself had all of these cool powers and how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging salting sequence the character in question dana angela zimmely has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of movie theater in which the presence is seated priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to large platter of fried chicken he picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever when she starts to leave the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like either creature from gwar show or terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life walks out and makes like it wants to be crucified by her the presence starts to clap annoyingly which continues for the rest of the sequence until dana takes off with the strange creature following her when it finally catches up to her she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ the box for the film claims because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 contains nudity and graphic violence while both is certainly true there doesn seem to be much of either in any large amounts besides loving close up of spurting neck stump semi graphic self surgery scene and two instances of head trauma one run over and one melting most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety as for nudity it is very sparse but at least we get to see angela zimmerly far and away the most attractive cast member before her body is bruised torn and bloodied by the dragging incident ice from the sun has been released on vhs by www movie com it has been presented in in full frame only and the transfer for film shot good deal in 8mm is pretty decent besides the decent soundtrack which is also available from www movie com making of video is also available called on thin ice haven had the opportunity to see the documentary but actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed if only to see how director eric stanze director of similar cult film called savage harvest conducted the atmosphere on set
going to start this review off with hypothetical question let say you ve just been in car accident and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious your friends have left to go get help and you re waiting to see if the victim wakes up tow truck comes along and the driver hops out of the truck to see what going on he then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck do you run away screaming for your life staying away from the main road run away but not too fast and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you stop to catch your breath try to negotiate with the psycho and when that fails start running away again all the while staying on the main road if you answered you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of texas chainsaw massacre the next generation and will likely hate this movie however if you answered prepare to enjoy film made with idiots like you in mind texas chainsaw massacre the next generation is being called sequel but it really more of remake of the original there few changes here and there but it essentially the same even the infamous meathook scene has been re created the story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere needless to say they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family much carnage ensues to call this movie inept would be putting it mildly in addition to the laughably idiotic situation mentioned in my hypothetical question there is moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere it just swoops down and kills him with its wheel no explantion is given as to who was flying it or why he she is going around killing people with the planes wheel the dialogue is even more atrocious zellwegger who is kidnapped by the family early on keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people when you re surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses would think that rationality would go out the window speaking of going out the window there is scene in which zellwegger jumps out window apparently the stunt double had little trouble because she visibly gets stuck in the window the director quickly cuts to wide shot where the stunt double doesn get caught in the window this was one of many glaring inconsistencies there are so many in fact that if were to name them all this review would be several pages long the only reason am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey he plays member of the family with hydraulic leg home made might add and is so completely over the top you can help but be amazed by his performance he obviously had lot of fun with this part and it really shows he makes jack nicholson portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in the shining look restrained in comparison for horror movie texas chainsaw massacre the next generation contains surprisingly little gore in fact in contains none there little blood here and there but that as far as it goes which leads me to believe that the budget must have been astonishingly low and it shows everything about the movie looks cheap from the sets to the costumes especially leatherface once frightening and nightmare inducing he now as terrifying as dame edna do yourself favor and take pass at this remake check out the far superior original instead
sometimes when decide to write short story or poem think of title first and then think of subject to go with it it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence wouldn be surprised if couple of guys got together and created the opening credits and then someone saw it and made up story to go along with it the title sequence is so good so ominous and original that it had me engrossed before the picture even began of course my attention dwindled shortly into the film disturbing behavior like so many thrillers starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous it teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex it suspense film with no suspense it an evil small town story with no story to speak of it disaster listless and uninspired disaster that just barely misses one stardom because of few good sequences mercifully short running time and one terrific set of opening credits our main man is fellow named steve clark blandly played by jimmy marsden he moves to small town with his family after tragically his brother shoots himself steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother we learn this through strange home video like nightmares that he has occasionally the big trial for steve is of course to fit in at school and make new friends marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail so he seems poor casting choice for social reject as social reject he falls in with some pretentious dope smoking philosophers gavin nick stahl and rachel katie holmes gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks known as the mavi ribboners are actually bunch of zombies assimilating new members into their group while sporadically killing innocent people so it up to our group of mismatched protagonists to solve the mystery and do something about it by the end of it all something has happened and things have been explained but the film still doesn make any sense disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg ve seen his name around recently he was one of the toucher uppers on the armageddon script and imagine that for the most part he knows what he doing when it comes to screenwriting he did however have complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film and then decided to actually take the time to write it out evil small town films are pretty common the last one phantoms is also dismal failure but it takes lot of skill to make the formula work rosenberg script is complete mess lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization and it makes no sense nor is their any purpose when things are finally explained there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks but the film never explains exactly what is happening they get strapped to chairs microchip is inserted into their eyes and poof they become sex crazed superviolent machine like creatures the doctor responsible for all this dr caldicott bruce greenwood must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is step up from the way high school jocks actually behave or perhaps this is the only realistic element in the film much of the writing is simply bad and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act in one terrible scene gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques while pointing them out in the cafeteria up front should say that in four years of high school did not eat in the cafeteria even once that aside the various social groups he points out are general uninteresting and poorly shown for instance he points to the nerds who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops it such an obvious cliche that can believe rosenberg even bothered most of the dialogue is forced no one says bite me anymore and none of the scenes have any degree of wit this picture is not inspired and most scenes flop from one to the other with no sense of momentum or energy the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter who apparently likes his films dry horror films should at least exploit violence but this one is shockingly timid there are few good scenes though such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum this is however the most forced scene in the film for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn also liked the school janitor character played by william sadler he has few lines that are surprisingly thought provoking the acting is largely waste of talent marsden is as said bland thought not particularly bad bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted stahl and holmes both show they have talent but the direction isn good enough to hone in on their skills stahl performance seems more like parody of high school potheads none of these characters expand beyond their one dimension and frankly watching cardboard cut outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn all that cool disturbing behavior is wreck of film and it started out wreck before shooting even began surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make good film or that it would make lot of money at the box office it not boring or even blatantly awful but it an uninspired lump of film it sure starts off nicely but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable so if you go to see this film take my advice appreciate the credit sequence and pray it never ends
phil radmar jao has hairy problem his beard is growing so rapidly that he has to shave every hour he recently met the author of non fiction book on lycanthropy also referred to in the movie as werewolfism and phil now believes that his problem is that he has become werewolf using enough chains and handcuffs to be hit at sadomasochists convention he ties himself in at night lest his urges overcome him and phil is just one of the many quirky characters that inhabit shopping for fangs made on pittance the film features an almost exclusively asian american cast as directed by quentin lee and justin lin the movie is so amateurishly bad that it could almost be parody of indie films jeanne chin plays katherine meek and soft spoken wife who worries that her husband is unhappy with her because she is not giving him enough sex we know this through the endless scenes of her confessing her sins real and imagined to her therapist as her husband jim clint jung plays muscle man with macho crudeness the picture is filled with stereotypes there mysterious loud mouthed waitress with big platinum blonde wig who brags to everyone she meets that she lesbian she spends most of the movie putting the moves on her favorite customer gay guy and the lone beyaz with major role the author on werewolfism has wildly unkempt orangey blonde curly hair from its opening scene of an attempted rape at knifepoint to its easy to guess ending twist the script rarely has anything to offer the story is so minimally developed that it feels almost like the actors were ad libbing one can only hope that the directors next film will have some substance and some credible acting shopping for fangs runs 30 it is rated for sex violence and profanity and would be fine for older teenagers
200 cigarettes takes place on new year eve 1981 monica played by martha plimpton is having huge new year party everyone in town is trying to get there but some are caught up in other things this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes as we meet the characters headed towards the party we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal and not interesting at all this disappointed me greatly the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion lucy played by courtney love is with kevin played by paul rudd the two are in relationship that is more of friendship but starts to blossom into something more than that this subplot is extremely boring and dull and am getting quite sick of plots like that janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot dealing with kevin she plays ellie an ex girlfriend of kevin this subplot is completely waste of garofalo talent there was no point to it at all and it was hardly even in the movie when lucy runs into bartender played by ben affleck another subplot is formed the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monica party at the bar he runs into two more girls the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker but unfortunately due to the terrible acting of both of them don even remember their characters names ben affleck is good actor but his character doesn go anywhere so he doesn have much screen time to give good performance featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles and they are part of the reason the film is so bad christina ricci plays val and gaby hoffman plays stephie the two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost they meet some guys and end up going around with them all night this subplot was alright but it was quite annoying with stephie accent hoffman did an okay job of acting but ricci did good she was underused considering she is such wonderful actress another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy played by goldie hawn daughter and jack played by jay mohr jack is an actor who doesn care about the girls he goes out with he just likes dates for one night and the next day he doesn kate hudson is huge klutz she gets herself into very funny situations that are the funniest parts in the entire movie they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well this subplot could have been used more mainly due to hudson performance mohr wasn good but he wasn bad he was just alright which didn find acceptable there is not much to say about the performances in the film none of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not the only performances that can judge are christina ricci as always good performance kate hudson funny role courtney love mediocre performance and paul rudd annoying and overused performance was hoping for little more out of jaw mohr ben affleck casey affleck gaby hoffman dave chapelle and especially out of janeane garofalo the two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes martha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like was in the year 1981 the soundtrack is full of 1980 tunes ranging from want candy to tainted love the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s during the film often found myself asking the questions is there reason to this is there any moral story is there point are any of the events going on in the film necessary do care what lucy and kevin are going through the movie is extremely boring and by the time they reached eleven clock one hour before midnight could not wait for the movie to be over the plot is okay but the subplots make it terrible maybe if the film was about the party not about the people at the party it could have been lot better the bottom line just like slasher movie this 80s comedy is just one too many
seem to have glued myself to myself starring jason biggs seann william scott chris klein thomas ian nichols allyson hannigan shannon elizabeth natasha lyonne tara reid mena suvari eugene levy jennifer coolidge directed by rogers rated american pie reunites the cast members from american pie in different setting instead of being high school seniors looking to score before they graduate they are now past their first year of college and have gathered in beach house to enjoy the summer of their lives jim jason biggs is still an insecure geek looking to improve his performance oz chris klein is still the sweetest guy on the block having sickeningly saccharine phone conversations with his studying abroad girlfriend stifler seann william scott is still horny stoner kevin thomas ian nichols still has no personality and finch eddie kaye thomas still longs for stifler mom have missed anyone so obviously not much has changed this is not problem provided that the movie boasts the rapid fire hilarity and unexpectedly true sentiment of the original but american pie is the very definition of sequelitis it coarser yes and it pushes the envelope even more but its heart isn in it it easy cash to capitalize off the first film success but it would have been worthier investment to prolong the franchise by coming up with something original part of the reason why the film doesn work think is that while in the original the kids quest for sex was coming of age stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness here everything has been cheapened they behave like those idiot frat boys who kill themselves drinking they have no motivation except for sex sex beer and sex that not to say that you can make decent comedy from that premise but it is one of american pie undoings missing too is the sweetness that permeated american pie the this could be you quality of the main players here the characters are too aware of themselves as pop culture icons and they re even more one note stifler and finch are now caricatures while jim oz and kevin are forced to make awkward self discoveries at arbitrary moments none of them betraying what the writers think the audiences want to see and then there the soon to be notorious scene where jim superglues himself to himself which perfectly demonstrates yet another of the film ailments one that also permeated say it isn so director rodgers debut there fine line between comedy and abject humiliation and american pie is on the wrong side of it it hard to laugh at the characters when you are profoundly embarrassed for them shielded my eyes watching this more than have watching any horror movie if there one redeeming factor to american pie it the inimitable eugene levy as jim dad who pops in on jim as he about to score and utters lines like your mother and have been known to get frisky not so much anymore but and then when the girl parents walk in blurts out this must be your daughter didn get her name but hopefully my son did if only the rest of the movie had the wit and wisdom of levy performance this is an unworthy sequel to gross fest that brought back the raunchy teen comedy the box office of this onw should keep the genre going strong which is disappointing the genre needs hiatus filmmakers are getting lazy
are you like me do you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places shouting out loud not giving ratt ass about anyone around them and basically just wallowing in their own self importance well if you are than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and half only to make up and hug in the end aaaaaaaahhhh plot three grown up sisters living their own separate lives begin to re establish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill critique this would be good movie if it wasn for the fact that it got very little to say features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations is chockfull of bad acting moments and provides less emotional satisfaction than any third rate after school special and being nice how junk like this gets made is beyond me but happy am that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt professional blow considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryan character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at christmas tree lot wow how deep of course the same christmas tune that played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background while characters continue to build bonds among one another by making reference to old quaint movies or movie stars stop me gonna cry again this film is mess the characters are boring and irritating to watch the plot has something to do with three selfish sisters talking on the phone whole lot kind of liking their father but not really and then finally realizing the error of their ways while sharing an emotional moment about movie stars from the 50s admittedly was not expecting much from film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds and big dog rolling its eyes but even was surprised at the level of ineptitude when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth in this film meg did fine as the sister who cries lot looking as adorable as ever but someone please put lisa kudrow inside permanent home of limited range cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movie tv show that she in enough already and diane keaton must ve spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one cause her acting was amateurish at best neither one convinced in emotional scenes granted they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film and that probably where my rating of three points comes from all in all this movie is not funny unless you re one to chuckle at train wrecks provides zero drama unless you consider loud phone conversations moving generates absolutely no emotion although did tear up when meg hugged coffee machine and ends on perfectly pretentious note oh no please don get any flour on my donna karan dress ugh suggest that all ladies take their husbands boyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something that ll teach em to mess with you oh and incidentally mrs joblo also likened this movie to piece of cow dung flailing in the wind so there then again maybe you ll like it
warner brothers has scored another marketing coup the one two punch was started in the summer with the release of batman forever trailers for ace ventura were bundled with the bat ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel carrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the ever wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video $11 99 at wal mart mere two weeks before carrey return in this marketwise but misfired comedy ace ventura when nature calls is painful reminder of just how grating the rubber faced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment he may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher in batman forever but here left to his own devices carrey quickly wears out his welcome the opening sequence is by far the best an amusing spoof of cliffhanger with ace performing mountain rescue of stranded raccoon you can guess what happens to mr paws hint it sounds like splat the plot quickly shifts to temple in the himalayas and then to not so darkest africa where ace is on the case of missing beyaz bat with his hair and limbs both wildly askew carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes the rest of the film is just more of the same sure the plot linear and the production values solid but where is the scripted humor to support carrey sloppy slathering writer and director steve oderkerk provides precious few set ups instead carrey just mugs away playing for the camera even when most of it isn funny the better gags have been shown in the ads though bit with ace emerging buck naked from the backside of mechanical rhino is something to see though an arguable improvement over the original ace ventura when nature calls is still snooze for anyone over the age of ten the script is virtually devoid of wit tribal mask jokes jerry lewis cameos forget it if anything the inexplicable presence of simon callow four weddings and funeral and bob gunton the shawshank redemption suggests that working with carrey is the classical actor ultimate challenge just how long can they keep straight face
friend invites you to movie this film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare and be grounded in reality the plot is as follows after terrifying incident mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city they need fresh air to get some perspective maybe to start over romance begins to brew however as one of the locals played by an international superstar in rugged clothing sparks things up especially at country western slow dance it stars rising young starlet helms good cast and is directed by one of the better actor turned directors in hollywood you accept you jump at the opportunity to see what you believe to be _the horse whisperer_ but poor moviegoer you have been conned alas you find yourself watching incredulously _hope floats_ oh woe your hope has sunk why was this movie made why was it released it is travesty on nearly every level and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved at the hands of better script the film could have been gem but it is clueless as to what it is about and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers _hope floats_ stars sandra bullock as birdy who after discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend on national television no less takes her daughter and drives back to her home helmed by countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands she decorates with stuffed wildlife birdy nephew travis played by _leave it to beaver_ cameron finley is under her custody and in one of the film many failed in jokes is always seen wearing different halloween costume what is the point of this does it make any sense is it supposed to be funny the point of the film is to show that the family is eccentric but was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of child all of this undercuts the plot of which there is none there are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion there the scene where birdy who used to be the prom queen is humbled by approaching peer she once mocked for job there the scene where birdy dances with her father in the hospital for alzheimer and then there the sentimental scenes with justin played by harry connick jr who is taking liking to her again showing her beautiful pad that he built from scratch and during each of these scenes was sidetracked by my earlier question what sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great pains as to provide dog costume kermit costume cowboy costume with whip and full furred barney costume for her grandson to wear during dinner what sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest of his life outside of this there are other sure signs of screenwriters block when the daughter stands up to the bully at school when birdy almost loses her job when the family pulls in goofy lip synch to cheer someone up when someone dies when the daughter cries no wails in exasperation that her father is not coming back in movie like this you notice the strings being pushed and you sit there comatose hoping it will end who can survive such debacle worry for bullock career which has been running on auto pilot for the last few years she has an attitude solid perkiness and can drive bus but she can handle the emotional scenes much less hold southern accent harry connick jr is worse stick with singing or get some acting lessons please gena rowlands is the best part of the film but she such good actress that it staggers the mind that she weighed down by such lukewarm material here it would be severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes great films is known for this film two notes to forest whittaker cut the slow motion sequences there are twelve times where you undercut your own direction by such failed trick have you done so you could have shaved off ten minutes of this almost unbearable debacle you ve had to know something was wrong if your cinematographer filter makes the candlelight appear like little you re not bad director but you can change terrible script there recurring scene where birdy working at the neighborhood fotomat finds the machine go wrong and image after destroyed warped dark image appear think about it succession of destroyed images may have been more entertaining than this movie
ve never written review for movie haven watched all the way through but had to make an exception with powder was about forty five minutes into this one at friend house when he and his brother got into huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house so never got to finish the movie and sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of bad movie but can at least get partial review out of it because saw enough to know this one wasn worth finishing in the first place the movie centers around freaky teenager who spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents house when grandpa dies taking his department store down with him social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder first and middle names gold bond to state home where we find out he different from the other kids actually we find out he different when we first see him because he the most pale individual we ve ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie the father takes one look at him and says he not my son obviously all want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago so the white faced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids that is until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him wear his spoon you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass decisions decisions and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into giant pile in the middle of the table so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy his mother must be sissy spacek carrie character and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes as we find out powder has some sort of super intelligence your test went straight off the chart and attracts electrical power this first shows up as powder visits the world of high school if he such genius already why would he need high school education and sits through demonstration in jeff goldblum science class goldblum plugs in jacob ladder device that shows current running up two wires and immediately the current flows across the room and into powder chest but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching instead of just unplugging the damn thing guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in row following hideaway and nine months that about all saw before the big fight began and let me tell you that was twice as interesting as the movie itself but like said saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization none of these movies ever handle the subject properly instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having beautiful woman fall in love with the guy personality overlooking his personal appearance already had the female character picked out the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene but guess ll never know for sure what happened from noraruth@aol

nothing more than high budget masturbation fantasy showgirls nc 17 contains graphic nudity profanity sexual situations and violence some people however keep their clothes on you do not watch porn films for their intellectual values nor do you write reviews on them that why this review will be short it seems that this film will end up in the porn section when it hits the video stores there is no story script point or acting only naked bodies which is exactly the point here is the so called plot nomi the 23 year old with dark past as hooker has hitchhiked from somewhere back east to perform in show where dancer doesn wear much more than light coating of powder and big fake smile no one is twisting nomi arm no one is holding her grandmother hostage she wants to do this and that is what she is doing till the end credits so what the problem then what the point what the film about is there anyone whose aspirations could inspire less sympathy this film can be described in one sentence obscene level of incompetence excessive stupidity in the story line gross negligence of the viewer intelligence prurient interest in the quick buck believe me after an hour with these characters acting and script you ll start hoping for someone to kill somebody elizabeth berkley makes laughable try as the heroine of this film that is bad even for eszterhas script her character is the only one that is at least half written and she could really have done better her character denies the fact that she is whore for the industry selling her body to the hungry eyes of the horny public am not whore am dancer she screams but does it in such an over dramatized way that you ll start laughing in fact the acting in showgirls brings terrible to new and previously unknown level not one single achievement besides the conventional cinematography is worth mentioning it is total waste of time and money there is not single moment of what you might call intelligence the dialogue is structured of ancient stereotypes and cliches lined up one after another its attempt to even imagine to have half brain results in catastrophe in my films writes director paul verhoeven basic instinct total recall hold the mirror up to life well excuse me his attempt to go behind the scenes of las vegas and as he put it show the naked truth is simplified and unreal occasionally between his collection of mistakes and logical irrationalities screenwriter joe eszterhas the creator of some of the worst screenplays in hollywood history inserts some lines of deep morality that sound something like this hey see you see that you re hiding from what from you yes and even the only decent line in this film nomi is what las vegas is all about can save showgirls from going under it strange phenomena it not erotic because it lacks sensuality not dramatic because it lacks the acting and not intelligent because it lacks story it is simply verhoven bad excuse for making pornography you want to see naked women bare breasts full frontals it nothing wrong with that but in that case suggest that you rent porn film in your local video store and not waste time surviving through eszterhas pathetic dialogue qualities while it only high budget porn film
dr dolittle 20th century fox running time hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor 1996 murphy returns in this abysmal comedy he plays doctor john dolittle who as child had the ability to understand animals however after being exorcised he loses this ability and we fast forward to see dolittle in crummy job surrounding by crummy people most notably dr mark weller played by oliver platt however with bonk on the head his ability to understand animals returns and comedy is ready and waiting to happen except comedy never does happen doctor dolittle even with the excellent premise rarely manages to raise laugh poor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout the whole movie and his performance suffers the manic murphy we saw in the 80 is gone his more mature and more boring twin appears to be getting all the work in the 90 the voices of the animals which include albert brooks chris rock the new eddie murphy and norm mcdonald as lucky the dog are marginally better and at least they put enthusiasm in the movie sadly most of their lines are pretty dumb and they re not funny dumb like dumb dumber 1994 but just boring dumb the film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through in desperate attempt to raise some laughs there are few good jokes in the script but they are few and far between if had to choose favourite performance it would probably be albert brooks tiger who has certain charm about him sadly he barely in the movie and rock really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time joke wise we are thankfully spared the mocking and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor the director betty thomas has well done better films she bought us private parts 1997 and the brady bunch movie 1995 which were sadly much better than this the scenes lack any charm she just gets the job done the animals themselves are reasonable realistic although most of them are obviously puppets there an impressive looking tiger however and the lip sync is pretty good you have no problem guessing that most of the close up are puppets however with their jilted movement was hoping jim hensons workshop who created the furry friends would have done better job doctor dolittle in the end is disappointment for everyone involved murphy has done much better movies trading places the director has seen better days and even the creatures aren that good the target audience aged between 13 who are undemanding will probably like it however thanks to it dumbed down humour everyone else however should give doctor dolittle miss
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned quick robin the anti shark repellant adam west in the 1966 batman feature film casually kicking at pathetic looking rubber shark attached to his leg had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness but in many instances batman and robin nears and at some point even exceeds this standard this is disasterously bad film easily the worst in the series to date and fairly epitomizes cinematic definition of the word excessive it loud garish and obnoxious with pointless gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill batman and robin features the caped crusaders george clooney debuting as batman with chris donnell returing as robin squaring off against another bevy of chemically induced villains the nefarious ice cold mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger armed with weapon which freezes everything in its sights and the slinky poison ivy uma thurman who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result but whatever and then dispatch them with poisoned kiss by ivy side is the giant steroid monster bane jeep swanson grunting hulk of beast the villains goals are noble ones freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees so that he can survive in order to devise cure for his beloved wife vendela dying of degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation and ivy intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth albeit by destroying all human life meanwhile on the homefront life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth michael gough and the arrival of his niece barbara alicia silverstone akiva goldsman screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad with astonishingly terrible dialogue lame jokes and an awful by the number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement it makes goldsman screenplay of batman forever which thought was dreadful look positively inspired in comparison am still astonished that cheesy plot device which seen used in no joke an episode of gilligan island somehow make its way into multimillion dollar blockbuster production joel schumacher direction of batman and robin is horrific with terrible balance of flashiness over substance there is clear conceit towards neon in this film even moreso than with his previous batman forever with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo just in case suppose if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly pointless fight sequence with bane and street gang over ivy chosen new abode another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons mr schumacher focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible to the detriment of the story there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all out camp and heartfelt drama with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film opening even before single line of dialogue had been uttered is batman and robin supposed to be campy think it is it hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted bomb each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be somehow doubt it the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn attempting to be the utter farce which it is arnold schwarzenegger is top billed in the film as the villainous mr freeze and is bland and uninteresting perhaps the worst thing that villain can be mr schwarzenegger attempts to be menacing are laughable and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable frankly everything he does onscreen is laughable by the end of the film was stifling chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen the bulk of his performance consists of uttering near unintelligble puns and one liners featuring every possible permutation of cool in the least inventive way george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin being overshadowed by the villains and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film his batman is hardly an imposing figure chris donnell is unimpressive in one note performance while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all the film one saving grace undoubtably uma thurman entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy her work in batman and robin is certainly over the top but in controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film ms thurman comic timing is impeccable and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully already starting to positively reassess jim carrey performance in batman forever her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film and when she offscreen the film greatly suffers figure that if one has to die being kissed to death by uma thurman isn half bad way to go while batman and robin was hardly ride of pulse pounding excitement must admit that was not bored watching it although did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one liner and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat it been long time since ve laughed so much at movie at of course is the operative word
silly film that tries to be siyah comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy with its main asset being beautiful film location along spain mountainous coastline howard pigeon jeff goldblum is 40 year old mineral water salesman who is married for 13 years to wife constantly nagging him elizabeth mimi rogers after surprise birthday party for him where his wife bawls him out for coming late to his surprise party he confides to his best friend that he can stand it anymore and then tells him his plan to kill her while vacationing in the same barcelona hotel where they spent their honeymoon jeff is going through severe mid life crises worried that he looks older than his age he incessantly talks to himself mostly agonizing over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with elizabeth for second time and then why he married her just because she laughed at his jokes and was attractive he stutters and acts like man who has lost his confidence things change on their vacation as elizabeth makes an effort to be nice while jeff now becomes the grouch he nervously rehearses his murder plan in the hotel room by accident the gun goes off and into the pillow where he imagined elizabeth would be sitting when other hotel guests and staff come to check about the gunshot he nervously explains that it was the tv realizing how unworkable his plan is he places the gun in the shattered pillow and throws it into the ocean while he waits for elizabeth but elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip and when after great deal of effort to get reservation at the hotel star restaurant he insists on eating in the room she decides she had enough of him and checks out without telling him as result he goes to the police to report her missing while with the police telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants to be alone his boss and all those he works with are sympathetic to him and he gets job promotion but soon the pillow with the gun is fished out of the water giving the police cause to arrest him and search his home there they find letters he has written incriminating him to the murder the police also find out from the hotel staff about the gunshot heard in his room in jail things look bad for him no one believes him including his friends and lawyer his boss fires him and the papers have field day with the headline story pigeon jailbird out on bail he realizes that his only hope is to track down his wife through call placed on his credit card he tracks her down to mountain resort once there he learns that she took hike up the steep mountain and he gets priest to be his mountain guide after telling him the true story the film is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance he is someone coming apart by the seams while mimi rogers is his perfect foil it was mostly pantomine humor with the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation very minor farce that might appeal to the sitcom crowd the film just didn take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it so it had no chance for siyah humor to develop it instead played its set up of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw
my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one but in fact the third installment it was the first to gain national theatrical release didn see the first film until much later so looking back the original didn hold lot of great memories for me since didn think too much of it when initially saw it watching it now for second time confirmed that it an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever you all know the story by now child murderer freddy krueger robert englund returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before this first installment does an adequate job with it low budget but there some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story plus the movie ending understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have hook for sequel renders the rest of the film pointless and does anyone understand what happens to nancy mother at the end of this film don get me wrong though it not as if new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is horror is difficult genre to pull off credibly and nightmare on elm street just doesn cut it nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video it is available both as single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set the film is presented in both pan and scan and it original theatrical aspect ratio of 78 although on the disc that comes in the box set only widescreen transfer is provided the film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio mono mix and new dolby digital mix also included on the dvd is full length audio commentary track with writer director wes craven stars john saxon and heather langenkamp and the film director of photography other extras include the jump to nightmare feature sure you can figure that one out the usual cast and crew bios which are from the film original press release kit and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp and the film original theatrical trailer some dvd rom features are also included but since don have dvd rom capabilities can really get into that the commentary track is entertaining and informative but nothing spectacular the first thing of note is that it the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from few years ago not saying that negative thing just pointing it out everyone seems enthusiastic about being there with the possible exception of john saxon who just doesn say much at all most of the time you ll forget he even there everyone else talks really quietly though for some reason as if because they re commenting on scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series also included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film however you can only access one easily the other is hidden in what called the labyrinth which might possibly be the most annoying feature of dvd ever created basically it an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage interviews etc somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film finding it though is both chore and bore [r]
disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities the result is merely an academic exercise leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn build on to show them as the poets they were on paper this shouldn have been so terrible it had talented director in agnieszka holland the secret garden proven screenwriter in christopher hampton dangerous liaisons and capable cast but the film was done in by its inept script the unappealing way the film was directed and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud found his performance to be the most risible one in the film with him acting more like teenage brat than young genius spouting obsenities without giving hint that true poet lies behind that facade he especially looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin character he was forced to be but when the two of them were together it looked like mismatch leonardo rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude yet we know from rimbaud poetry that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring the film opens in post revolutionary france in 1871 the 16 year old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine letter with his poems he accepts verlaine praises and invitation to be house guest in his splendid paris home and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville once there rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household has an immediate conflict with verlaine busty 18 year old wife mathilde romane and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family money even though he has nothing else in common with her when verlaine states poets can learn from one another rimbaud replies in haughty tone only if they re bad poets he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship verlaine proves to be weak willed beating his wife regularly and plays just as despicable character as rimbaud when mathilde father kicks rimbaud out of the house verlaine finds him in rooming house and the two become lovers it real downer to watch this story unfold into series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for divorce in brussels verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19 he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and gun runner and after ten years there comes home with tumor on his knee and dies changed man at the age of 37 the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying the film ends on whimper with verlaine talking with rimbaud sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published this film was especially annoying because rimbaud poems are filled with visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film but whatever it was it just didn work it certainly didn bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so called father of modern poetry
idle hands is distasteful crass and derivative if an original thought found its way into this horror comedy it would die of loneliness plus you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teen agers the week after the tragedy in littleton colo the movie is insulting to horror film fans and teen agers the plot what little there is deals with anton devon sawa high school slacker who hand goes on murderous rampage after becoming possessed along the way the hand kills anton parents and his two best friends the friends also slackers are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them that is the level of this atrocity humor the movie treats death as joke idle hands is gruesome and morbid the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish realize this is supposed to pass for comedy but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen it is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life and can only presume that the writers of idle hands terri hughes and ron milbauer were trying to make some statement about today young people and their values in satiric vein however it hard to laugh at death these days especially ones involving young people with the real horrors of the world put before us on television stale pastry such as idle hands should be held from release for few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths idle hands is bad no matter the circumstances in the world outside but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings the time is not right for this type of movie and as far as idle hands goes the time may never be right this is movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema
it shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying osmosis jones is crude gross disgusting and was directed by the farrelly brothers the twisted siblings behind there something about mary me myself and irene and couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt not that there anything wrong with scatology bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor such as it was it merely that with osmosis jones the farrellys humor is too juvenile too predictable you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy sequence is drawn osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho the trouble is the animation may please the very young but the jokes may be over their heads while the teen age audience may find it too tame for their tastes adults well let just say most will find it unappetizing osmosis jones plays like 100 minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby the live action sequences revolve around frank bill murray who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe he continually looks as if he needs shave and shower frank much to the consternation of his daughter is fast food addict eating anything and everything that can kill you he works at zoo where the animals look cleaner and presumably smell better than he does frank body is invaded by thrax lethal virus after frank eats hard boiled egg that had fallen to the ground it not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth nope the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle chimp for the egg wresting it from the primate mouth like said the gross meter tips the scales on this one after ingesting the egg the movie begins its animated sequences here osmosis jones voiced by chris rock renegade beyaz blood cell is teamed with drix voiced by frasier david hyde pierce 12 hour painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne basically what we have is cliched cop buddy movie rife with all the clich of that genre and this is why osmosis jones doesn click it merely falls back on tired familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations the jokes and puns are lame osmosis searches out snitch former flu virus after pumping him for information drix tells osmosis funny he doesn look fluish and the jokes don rise above that level the live action scenes are no better frank is such slob so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired child he almost bigger cartoon than the animated characters osmosis jones is movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left the animation is rather two dimensional and flat it lacks scope and depth it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head and maybe leaning toward shower after you walk out of the theater
burnt money is the perfect festival film it will show once or twice and then no one thankfully will ever have to hear from it again this film from the seattle international film festival 2001 emerging masters series is easily one of the year worst billed as gay `bonnie and clyde this gritty film from director marcelo pi eyro has its only highlight in well designed title sequence two gay lovers get involved in bank robbery that makes gang leader whose plan they screwed up angry this causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys one of whom may not actually be gay hiding out in prostitute apartment the two men must fight off police and gang members in very long showdown for the movie conclusion if caught they risk losing all the money and their love as an added emotional bonus one of the gay men is dying or something like that everything that happens is so quick and confusing was completely lost clarity isn exactly this movie striving virtue so it was little hard to pick up not much could have really happened though the main events in this long two hour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex graphic drug use extreme violence and strong language lots of explicit material is never bad thing when there reason but there no purpose to anything in this film most of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing it appears pi eyro who co wrote with marcelo figueras from novel by ricardo piglia purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement he makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible makes them snort cocaine gives them guns and condoms and lets them go burnt money is pointless the performances are bad it tries to thrill and shock but only causes boredom god forbid it will ever get distributor another disappointing film from this year so called emerging masters series pass on by

fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies but the quantity most of those movies were produced by cannon group company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman movie mentors of future hollywood legends unfortunately that didn happened and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal sadly for bronson that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead and lowering his own reputation in process on the other hand bronson could take comfort in fact that those movies were extremely popular especially among the audience or times younger than bronson himself one of such movies that seriously marred bronson reputation is death wish third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974 in the original movie bronson played paul kersey mild mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence that movie was far from masterpiece yet in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry unfortunately six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels even the presence of its original director didn stop the rapid decline of the quality death wish begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend living in the urban wasteland of east new york populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out before the reunion kersey friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker played by gavan herlihy probably the only noteworthy role in the film kersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade while the police inspector shriker ed lauter ants to use him as secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime bronson the main asset in this movie plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine although bronson charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities single man in his 60s and armed with single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower the lack of emotions or bronson own commitment could be seen in very few lines spoken in film the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness so they added romantic interest for their hero public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey crusade on the other hand emotions are much better played by confronting law abiding yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey unfortunately michael winner doesn know how to work out the plot and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations ends this movie with bang the big showdown at the end that turns east new york into the sarajevo like battle zone is probably the worst part of the movie because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget in short this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia special note for trekkies marina sirtis the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek the next generation could be spotted in small role of portorican wife
how could rated disney film based on meg cabot novel the princess diaries be anything but cute harmless fun easy take all the cute harmless fun out of it and while you re at it make it borrr ring that what director garry marshall screenwriter gina wendkos and not to be outdone producer whitney houston have done with the rated disney film the princess diaries you couldn tell it from the audience though braintree mass of growing glowing pre pubescent girls and the odd parental popcorn perched about their persons who positively cheered when the end credits rolled ah the film had struck lovely nerve with them but not with fuddy duddy old me well might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over but that would have been too obvious too obvious is the least of the problems with marshall film garry made couple of other princess movies pretty woman and runaway bride but this one way without julia roberts so maybe that its problem in addition to being predictable as molasses the princess diaries has hardly got laugh in it it comedy could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long long stretches and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we haven even seen yet and probably never will except perhaps in the dvd edition marshall should take virtually all of the blame here since he been at this for some time and should know when scene or two isn working and hardly any of the princess diaries works works alas implies cleverness and there none of that here either newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall had bit of fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of the filmmakers go out of their way not to call it serbia which is pretty much what all miniscule european countries are called in the movies mark my words and now she mia is next in line to rule genovia hence the headphones tiara combo in the print ads julie andrews with the luminous factor cranked to 11 plays mia grandmother aka queen clarisse renaldi who shows up out of the royal mavi and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating talking and looking like princess department although mia big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of good laugh not really consuming corn dog is about the worst that it gets also on stereotypical hand are brainless jock an evil cheerleader dorky looking best friend welcome to the dollhouse heather matarazzo sensitive auto mechanic musician and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mia chauffeur driven limousine at every intersection non animated rated movie is rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts all the good stuff has been exorcised from the finished product lame labored and lamentable the princess diaries is recommended for eight and half year olds of the feminine persuasion only all others would do well to avoid it like potholes the plague and the perfect storm
giving this stinker normally the worst that would ever rate movie would be but the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive helped me come to the big goose egg not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing or if he was even thinking at all maybe in mel little mind horse being knocked unconscious because of punch to the face is funny in mine it not or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking because only the self righteous lee uses the word more often in his films than brooks did in this one at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it wrong mel would call you boob mel but that insults breasts everywhere this idiotic attempt at comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governor harvey korman attempts to clear out town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out but the town appeals to the governor mel brooks in one of many uninspired and unfunny roles to send them new sheriff to protect them the governor pawns the task off to korman character hedley lamarr can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name lamarr decides to send the town siyah sheriff gasp in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of siyah man living among them that they will all just leave hold on ve got to stop while these gales of laughter pass it just too funny racism passing as humor gosh why didn anybody ever think of that one before oh wait think somebody might have they are called the kkk not calling brooks racist but am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldn know what was funny if it hit him over the head but digress anyway the siyah sheriff rides into town amid flurry of townsfolk using the word golly will the hilarity just never end he ends up joining forces with drunk gene wilder who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west together they save the day from evil not one person in this movie gives decent performance wilder looks like he is recovering from head injury for most of the movie and korman looks embarrassed to be part of the movie ok he really didn but he should have the films star cleavon little goes along with the siyah jokes as if they were discussing the time of day did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience admit to starting to snicker on couple of occasions actually the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise but alas it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever mel brooks would be doing the world favor if he burned every last copy of this film

michael robbins hardball is quite the cinematic achievement in about two hours we get glancing examination of ghetto life funeral with heartfelt eulogy speeches about never giving up cache of cute kids including fat one with asthma hard luck gambler who finds salvation in good woman and climactic big game where the underdogs prove to have bigger bite than anyone ever imagined all that needed is guy getting hit in the nuts and food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich can wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd obviously hardball is strikeout of movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball it stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam out of solutions he begs his successful corporate friend the always welcome mike mcglone to lend him $5 000 instead mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach youth baseball team from the projects for nice weekly stipend reeves who wants to keep his fingers accepts the offer but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely the drowsy voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in life of absentee parents and merciless gangs and maybe just maybe they ll play in the big championship game one of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins summer catch adapted from daniel coyle non fiction book is that there aren any the movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like zombie that wouldn be so bad if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them most of the kids time is spent yelling at each other talking in slang and acting surprised there little that naturally amusing about them as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling the worst of the lot is tough talking younger player dewayne warren whose sole purpose as the movie unfolds is being an emotional pawn tactic so utterly despicable can find the right words to express myself the adults also don fare well reeves is impressively uninspiring as the down on his luck loser the character is poorly written but reeves gives another charisma free performance every time he speaks he sounds like he just got up from long nap and is gradually waking up kids are supposed to rally around this guy diane lane who co stars as reeves obligatory love interest remains glowing screen presence see my dog skip for better proof it too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like these kids trust you and they don trust anyone then there sweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters you ve seen before and hope never to see again wanted hardball to be good robbins varsity blues was funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved haven seen robbins goofy ready to rumble in its entirety but am intrigued that macho man randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions robbins obviously needs to go back to his forte making sports movies for guys and not cutesy cuddly pap such as hardball which also manages to annoy and insult the audience here hoping that happens in the immediate future
the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is fascinating topic finding an all star cast for such film is stroke of genius combining all that with three time oscar winning director robert benton of kramer vs kramer and creating decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment in yet another noir mystery set in hollywood how many of these have we seen during the past few years the atmosphere is moody the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere over 70 harry ross paul newman is washed up cop turned private eye turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life he screwed up things pretty well had wife and daughter now drunk and is at crossroads couple of years ago he traveled to mexico to bring back mel reese witherspoon the under age daughter of jack gene hackman and catherine susan sarandon ames and now lives with them the ames are former movie stars past their prime and the three have become fast friends one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up to fill his time he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine jack is in even worse shape than harry he dying of cancer with only year to live things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off sealed manila envelope for him instead of the routine errand that ross expects he walks into barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex cop who is himself full of bloody holes this unsettling event gives the former detective project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine first husband 20 years before through series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder blackmail guns mel mexico traveling partner and his parole officer ross former cop buddies ex lover and would be sidekick the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to it film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario by the time they show you it doesn matter the storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross relationship with rubin giancarlo esposito partner wannabe these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief however they are neither rubin and ross have some past relationship but either it not explained or didn care enough at that point to remember running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform it also not funny doesn connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course on the positive side it often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen the three leads all have well deserved academy awards and turn in accomplished if not extraordinary jobs newman is grand actor but doesn seem quite suited to the dark film style he is bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out hackman also low key is believable but lacks sparkle sarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is one dimensional the actors do what they can with lame dialog but they can pull the film out of the hole it dug for itself james garner who plays ross old buddy ex cop raymond hope is always treat but even he half heartedly struggles through lines like glad they didn shoot your pecker off the best part of the film is the look at old friends how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make the genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen the film doesn run very long before the audience realizes that it hopeless the only reason for watching is the actors it reminds me of disaster movies such as towering inferno where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the film problems in better world there would have been second rate actors in this second rate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better of course we don live in that better world but you could make yours little nicer by choosing different movie
martial arts master steven seagal not to mention director has built career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights talks in hushed tone and squints at any sign of danger he also the most consistent individual in hollywood today since all his movies suck they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art that is martial art sure the guy good and he seems like nice guy on talk shows although tad haughty but these movies he makes are all the same guy who is basically indestructable is maybe wounded supposedly mortally then comes back with vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses although kinda liked under siege of course this one as change has message that is drilled into our mind of course after he blows up lot of stuff and kills bunch of people so why do watch his crap usually don will never and you can hold me to this will never pay to see this man movies unless and only unless he in supporting role executive decision and definitely pay if he dies executive decision but this one has special place in my heart this doesn mean it good or that even liked it this was the last movie watched with my deceased uncle and we had one hell of time ripping it apart la mystery science theatre 3000 and this was couple years before had heard of mystery science theatre 3000 in this one seagal plays worker for mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased up typical shallow villain this time played by an oscar winner to give the movie some more clout michael caine it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land around the 20 30 minute point seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs what with his new fire down below another message film and caine has him bumped off or does he seagal is rescued by some inuits and falls in love with one of them played by joan chen who can act hypothetically but for some reason not here one of caine cliched henchmen played here with lot of overacting by john mcginley shoots the cheif of the inuit clan and chen and seagal go on voyage to take down the oil factory literally of course at one point seagal gives wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn have any options but blow stuff up he even goes as far as to say don want to kill someone and in the same breath he asks some guy where the arsenal is have no problem with violence huge john woo fan but he paints his films with suspense skill style depth characterization and just plain cool violence in the films of seagal the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly and him either wounding or killing them at some points they use the cliche of the talking villain where the villain has the advantage can shoot seagal but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan or saying corny line to which seagal says something hokey back and has had enough time to devise of way to do away with them and does this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn take itself seriously at all like in the case of this summer con air but seagal is serious about his skill and of course his message wouldn mind if this was message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence but seagal has no idea how to present film where the message is subtle not pounded into the viewer mind the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish thus we can take him and his motives seriously and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment he also goes ahead and blows up square mile of rig and kills some workers who were just doing his job then at the end he spends good 10 minutes giving speech just in case you didn get the message from the trailers what seagal doesn realize is that no one takes his films seriously although maybe couple do and any message he has is no only redundant but doesn comfortably fit in his film which is filled to the brim with hokey violence crap suspense stupid melodrama and characters who have about as much emotional depth as petri dish as far as seagal and his acting he rather boring he squints he kills period nothing else oh yeah there corny one liners gonna reach out and touch someone of course he the star and we re supposed to root for him and all so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and bunch of jerks michael caine who great actor is just supposed to yell and look cold he does it well guess but this is no alfie of coure no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him his big henchman john mcginley is kinda boring as well but is not horrible and we even get small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid lee ermey from full metal jacket as hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is just for the movie trailers and for seagal ego and also look for billy bob thornton as one of ermey assasins anyway to conclude this all to judge one of seagal movies is to judge all of them except for under siege and executive decision though the latter is not really seagal movie they all have this same formula they all have the same action same villain same plot but this one has that message which makes it more excrucitating to watch mean if you do rent it and don reccomend you do make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes but have to put it to seagal for creating film so bad that the last film viewed with my uncle was pleasurable one my extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock
arye cross and courteney cox star as pair of bostonians who meet in bar go to the movies fall in love move in together etc review ====== well if you haven seen when harry met sally or he said she said or if you don watch love war on television you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages however if you ve seen any of these than you have seen most of this film this of course doesn mean its bad some of it is amusing but overall just had to ask what the point arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love kevin pollack is the stereotypical female fearing best friend who make lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes most if which weren very funny couteney cox is the stereotypical career minded woman who falls in love julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical this film uses lot of formula the plot is basically known from the opening credits so what is good about the movie well as said there are few amusing moments surprisingly julie brown who usually find just plain goofy was the best thing in the film also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual gee this is really short not much to say about the film really it is just kind of there watching it on video might not be complete waste of time but wouldn recommend hiring baby sitter or spending lot of money to see it at the theatre
new entry in the revisionist history genre of filmmaking dick suggests that two not too bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation biggest presidential scandal kirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene who while trying to deliver fan letter from arlene watergate hotel room accidentally stumble across gordon liddy played dead on by harry shearer and the infamous break in when they recognize liddy later on during beyaz house field trip they are ushered into conference room questioned as to what they know and leave as official presidential dog walkers the girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with when they discover that nixon another dead on performance by dan hedaya who actually favors nixon slightly unlike anthony hopkins has been abusive to checkers the presidential dog thanks to the conversations that he always recorded they quit and become disillusioned during prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president resignation this film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king type talk show featuring cameo by french stewart about revealing the identity of deep throat from there we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad dick joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy at one point the girls are having to scream over high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial the band manages to stop right as dunst screams you have to stop letting dick run your life much to the horror of everyone standing within earshot several other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film if this movie had been smarter would have been less likely to fault it juvenile bathroom humor but it not the film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience throat in the least subtle way possible don recall oliver stone nixon having to pander to it audience but of course that film wasn comedy aimed squarely at 13 20 year old film going audience the only redeeming thing about this movie is it remarkable supporting cast wanted to see more of ferrell and mcculloch woodward and bernstein those two characters are the sole basis for my rating wish they had been given more screen time but unfortunately they are only relegated to the final half hour their constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are major highlight especially mcculloch constant thwarting of ferrell attempts to gather information from the girls who in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat so named thanks to an ill planned trip to porno theater by betsy brother the other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters but are given nothing to work with like to see the same cast portray these characters in script more suited towards their comedic abilities as for the two leads dunst and williams can definitely do better they come off as what could best be described as romy and michele the early years in this particular film highly dubious distinction at best stay through the first half of the end credits though to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie an excellent idea marred by poor execution dick could have been great movie less of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes could have made this film wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds as it stands though dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as dick and poopie jokes and that to me does not make funny movie [pg 13]
words thought never write the sequel to urban legend lacks the grace wit and power of the original put the gun to my head pull the trigger and put me out of my misery better yet put the horror genre out of its misery when you ve finished watching urban legends final cut you ll share my same grim point of view thanks to the horrible acting terrible script and ridiculous directing which has become all too common today urban legends final cut is smorgasbord of stolen movie ideas mainly from the blair witch project and scream fabulous people with perfect teeth and skin one creepy film school and dog eating freshly removed kidney from one of the movie hapless victims urban legends delivers story about bunch of film students working on their thesis films to win the coveted hitchcock award which guarantees the winner director deal in hollywood one female filmmaker jennifer morrison the freaky dead girl from stir of echoes writes fiction script based on serial killer who kills his victims according to urban legend tales suddenly her entire crew starts getting bumped off with urban legendary homicides but the bodies are always missing and she is often the only witness to the killings the killer wears fencing mask and long siyah overcoat looking like scorned olympian out to avenge his defeat in sydney why this is scary is never explained of course the golden rule of sequels is that there must be least one recurring character for continuity sake urban legends has one minor recurring character from the original who we never cared about anyway the security guard of all people the other central problem is that this character has already seen the urban legend killings once before but she utterly clueless about what going on around her call it suspension of disbelief this film is also prime example of how horror films are now completely dead in the water the last decent horror film was the blair witch project and that seemed more like snuff film than fiction the stalking killer with crazy motivation has become tired clich as everyone seems to have forgotten real horror is not about what is seen but about what is unknown
virus is monster movie without monster any movie with hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise sadly virus does not deliver on any level the movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something we never find out what to big boat with lots of satellites on it sudddenly wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space and winds up destroying mir and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat cut to seven days later we meet donald sutherland and his band of seafaring vultures see they spend all their time sailing around looking for dead in the water ships to rescue and then collect the reward money at least think that what they do along with many other things in the film their reason for being out in the middle of the ocean isn really explained so they stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites on it and decide to haul it back to russian waters the only problem is the crew starts disappearing one by one and turning into borg yes borg complete with the kirmizi laser beam in place of an eye apparently this alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical so it creates make shift machines and uses humans for spare parts blah blah blah could go on forever describing the ludicrous so called plot but won suffice it to say the most original thing about this movie is having donald sutherland play an irish man everything else in this movie has been taken from other better movies for example many of the machines resemble those found in the little seen japanese movie tetsuo the iron man and the plot is right out of aliens the funny thing is was actually expecting to enjoy this movie have soft spot for cheesy monster movies like last years under appreciated deep rising but virus as mentioned earlier doesn even have monster it just has big pile of circuits and wires and expects the audience to fear this ridiculous looking contraption virus is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it besides the lame monster it chock full of dialogue that no real person would ever say and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into for example there is scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to negotiate with the alien now don know about you but if came upon lifeform that viewed mankind as virus to be eliminated doubt that would attempt to reason with it that makes about as much sense as baby squirrel calmly asking fierce predator to spare his life finally virus isn scary the least the filmmakers could have done was to make the movie just little scary as it is it about as frightening as box of cookies skip virus if it cool monster movie you want rent the far superior and the granddaddy of this genre aliens
barb wire pamela anderson lee first foray into films highlights the fact that her only talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets being the only notable member of the cast the camera lingers lustily her body at every opportunity making her character catch line don call me babe sound very ironic indeed from the very opening of the movie we are treated to striptease routine from anderson ending in her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes of lusty male who happened to call her babe throughout the movie there is ample footage of enormous breasts and cleavage if not of anderson then at least of the female extras this alone is enough to retitle the movie babe wire for plot barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline it is 2017 the middle of the second american civil war and barb wire former resistance fighter runs joint in steel harbour called hammerhead known for attracting resistance fighters an characters of all sorts the bar attracts the attention of the government forces who appear dressed in nazi style uniforms in between bashing up helpless males and showing off her trademark breasts barb wire has to help former lover and his wife get to the airport on the other side of the town past the government controlled areas and to freedom even the airport looks like the one in casablanca except that the plane in the background is modern private jet there are hardly any significant moments in this film and one gets the impression that it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version of barb wire if anything one leaves the film with the confirmation that anderson di not do her own stunts who could fight and jump in skimpy strapless leather top and yet keep her breasts from spilling out only stuntwoman not pamela anderson lee
book should have remained in shadows book of shadows blair witch film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman certain things in our lives are inevitable death sorrow love heartbreak pain joy we expect these events we know they re going to happen and some we even look forward to it part of the human condition we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society as we near the fall election several of them are hitting us in the face politicians exaggerate their own importance our side is always right theirs is always wrong in the end voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if film makes big money there will be sequel even if the original story doesn merit one even if the first film is complete in itself even if success is fluke the blair witch project was made with budget of $1 75 and exploded on the screen raking in huge profits the concept was brilliant the filmmakers created remarkable buzz that the story might be real the film itself was even more convincing the movie _must_ be authentic why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen the first film caught lightning in bottle the sequel proves you can pour that old lightning into new bottle you have to give this effort some credit it would have been easy to have made the same movie again with new group of kids it would have been easy but of course it wouldn have worked instead book of shadows acknowledges the first film as movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release it great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do sequel unfortunately it doesn work either five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives even weirder stuff happens some people die there blood and knives and none of the characters have lick of common sense while supposedly doing serious research the group sets up circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to stay alert all night awaiting visitation then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud very obnoxious heavy metal music it bad plan the cast shows some early promise couple is doing research on blair witch book the tour guide is former mental patient turned ebay aficionado goth amazon princess adds bit of comedic relief the obligatory hot babe is the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick the cute wiccan chick the first film unaccomplished actors came across as real people in real situation because hours and hours of video were shot during days in the woods this time these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors there not one character you care about when they start shouting for no reason although what passes for plot starts out with solid idea it ruined by poor execution the follow up to one of the most successful horror films ever is nothing more than bad slasher movie they re trapped in an old big weird house they stupidly separate into various rooms there are strange noises they see scary apparitions and people disappear ever see this movie seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better the film features mostly cheap tricks and unnecessary gore for storyline filled with surprises it oddly predicable the blair witch project was rare triumph of style over substance the book of shadows is triumph of tedium over promise
the crown jewel of 1970 irwin allen disaster movies the poseidon adventure features an all star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on cruise ship the story begins on the poseidon big new year cruise where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive let see there the new age preacher hackman who advises people to pray to that part of god within yourself there the ex cop borgnine who busted hooker stella stevens six times then married her there the hippie singer there got to be morning after who turns to the company of lonely man kirmizi buttons once her brother is killed and to round out the group the elderly couple jack albertson and shelley winters who live aboard the ship the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall we get to know these people little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure before straight faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship everyone in the giant ballroom at the time shortly past midnight of the new year when the ship turns first on its side then completely upside down the second in command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on quest to the top of the ship in this case because the ship is overturned the top is the bottom or is the bottom the top either way we get to see lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and in the ballroom scene christmas trees thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors through burning rooms etc while the ship slowly fills with water behind them it race against the clock which is only mildly interesting the poseidon adventure works more as bad movie to laugh at with all the melodrama that comes in between the non thrilling action scenes the one note in borgnine one note performance is to be cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love although since there isn sex scene we never find out if his buttons really are kirmizi and albertson and winters wonder if they ll live to see their grandson birth shelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in scene toward the end where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with rope for the rest of them to pull along winters who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie stevens even not so affectionately calls her fatass in one scene finally finds her purpose was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when was seventeen she brags and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years she swimming through the water her skirt billowing up around her hips showing off her cellulite or do you call it shellulite ridden thighs it not so much funny as innately disgusting which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as whole
remember really enjoying this movie when saw it years ago guess my memory really sucks there is very very little that is funny in caddyshack the laughs are few and far between and what there are really aren that great caddyshack as the name implies more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club michael keefe plays said caddy why they cast this unknown fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me the movie doesn seem to have real plot just series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera the only real story if you can call it that was subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper bill murray who is having his own private little war against gopher who is ruining the course most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera with painfully limited success bill murray is slightly amusing in places but fairly wasted the biggest waste of all is chevy chase who didn even crack smile on my face with his character lame zen like approach to golfing there are few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie guess that what you get for basing story around an unknown kid not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of but really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper nothing about this movie works it wouldn have taken genius to figure out that this thing wasn going to fly most of the scenes just couldn possibly be funny it as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny in reality they were painfully embarrassing to watch there is scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the hot babe of the movie walking by in her bikini olive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl everything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned maybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny but for the rest of us stay the hell away from caddyshack
tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse the fugitive not quite this is the plot for double jeopardy another fugitive copycat without the action excitement and good acting that the original had there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good this time tommy lee jones plays parole officer not us marshall clever huh oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband bruce greenwood who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not one armed man both movies are on video make the wise choice and pick the fugitive there are so many flaws in double jeopardy it is laughable while serving time in prison libby parsons judd discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice learning that her husband is still alive she decides to serve her time in prison find him retrieve her son and kill her husband if necessary when the strict parole officer travis lehman jones stands in her way libby decides to break the rules who knows why and continue her plan despite the fact that if she gets caught she going back to jail director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son every other scene we are given shot of libby staring and crying at his picture in an action movie like this valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something all that is needed in this type of movie is short scene in which libby tells herself or friend miss my son nothing more nothing less dr kimble of the fugitive didn look at one picture of his dead wife his primary concern was to save himself libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this they will be typecast for the rest of their careers kind of like their doomed co star tommy lee jones winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his do my job whether they are innocent or guilty roles people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so guess he was right though don think he will win another oscar again the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count burglary assault grand theft auto are some of libby slipups the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you re innocent of the major crime hopefully criminals won use double jeopardy as reference in court for why they are innocent that would just be plain stupid
synopsis cro magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by lion reluctantly rescued by neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy style ayla grows up to become blond feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without mate comments allow me to state for the record that find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci fi classic blade runner the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as selling point the poster art bears striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title not even her starring role in this turkey unfortunately can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese it so uniquely bad film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries and miserably fails to be serious that it oddly fascinating the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed wanting to see how this dud plays out the clan of the cave bear is based upon popular novel by jean auel to this day the book possesses loyal cult following remember dear friend of mine had dog eared copy of the novel she had read as child with all the so called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother have never read this book but sure hope it 10 000 times better than its film adaptation if not then at complete loss to explain its popularity the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with comically absurd scene young ayla looking much like drew barrymore in tramps about in the woods with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her the audience expectations of convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered what follows is laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla mother blonde with fur pants er leggings tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera well as the earthquake slowly recedes hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch but the screaming six year old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find safe haven won detail the story any further this seems enough to illustrate my point this movie is really stupid it never even gives the audience chance to suspend their disbelief also the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning wonderbra in front of charlton heston the movie doesn just suggest this message it whacks the message into the audience with two by four blond gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs she of the new people they re of the old people with the memories yep we get it we get it the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make up which surprises me the movie depends upon lot of make up obviously but much of it is unconvincing as stated before daryl hannah is daryl hannah here she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time the rest of the characters have dark make up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt the face painting that occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind this movie also suffers from its new age trappings maybe the music sounded lot more fresh or original during 1985 but now it sounds dated and cliched like poorly conceived elevator music add to this the film faux mysticism including spirit animals and dream visions and narrator who sounds like psychic you expect to hear on 900 number and you get movie that has serious problems being serious the clan of the cave bear is rated though it probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films ve seen in quite while it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes the funniest moment of the movie occurs when neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from ferocious bear the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about although this may sound gratuitous sure it so cheesy that it probably won bother most people the clan of the cave bear is bad movie however as wrote at the beginning of this review it does have the distinction of originality typically when think of bottom of the barrel films dealing with early man fantasy movies involving dinosaurs who did not exist at the same time as man and raquel welch come to mind the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that though it so bad the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie which is why awarded this turkey two stars have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version however only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie shudder to think that it could be otherwise
the kids in the hall are an acquired taste it took at least season of watching their show on hbo before became believer maybe after watching half dozen kids in the hall movies they would grow into the big screen my recommendation is that unless you are big fan of the kids skip the film as it is their first and most likely only attempt at full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv big budget and glossy production can not make up for lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show the kids go through the motions but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics brain candy is bunch of skits tied together by the story of pharmaceutical company that develops new drug to cure depression in typical sketch comedy tradition each actor plays several roles doctor cooper kevin mcdonald and his team create the drug then under pressure from don roritor mark mckinney founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals dr cooper releases the drug into the marketplace the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film at about 90 minutes brain candy still seems long the best thing about sketch comedy and the kids are no exception is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs then go on to another quick skit but with the additional set up necessary in telling longer coherent story the laughs just dont come fast enough strangely the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv the movie makes several attempts at risqueness mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters but they seem almost forced as if they have to live up to pg rating one of the best bits though does make use of thompsons naked buttocks we see him charging into battle going to have sex with some guys taking shower in the classic of this genre monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail the kids unfortunately are not up to the task there are some amusing moments to be sure but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one
