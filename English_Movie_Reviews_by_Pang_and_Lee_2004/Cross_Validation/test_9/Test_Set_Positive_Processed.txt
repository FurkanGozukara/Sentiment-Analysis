on june 30 1960 self taught idealistic yet pragmatic young man became at age 36 the first head of government of newly independent african state formerly the belgian congo two months later he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides this little known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in lumumba patrice lumumba eriq ebouaney story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary lumumba death of prophet virtually guaranteeing that his new fictional account of patriot remains true to its subject peck with co writer pascal bonitzer begins at the end of the story of the young political leader we watch as two beyaz men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three siyah men images of hatchets saws and fast emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image jump back few years to meeting among the siyah leaders in the belgian owned congo third class postal worker lumumba speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes proclaiming himself not tribal not regional but national leader his small mobile party the congolese national movement mnc is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer and get his face known in the bustling capital stanleyville at time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world lumumba is in the right place at the right time and through political savvy and chess like manipulation achieves position of leadership of the mnc as the date for independence approaches he tactically positions himself to be the new nation first prime minister and defense minister supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu maka kotto the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country vast natural resources of copper diamonds altin and more lumumba won seek the help of the us knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves belgian troops violently intervene the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe pascal nzonzi and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from conference abroad this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50 and 60 during the time the story takes place many new nations including nigeria and somalia were born with varying degrees of success and failure usually dependent upon which country colonized them some colonial masters were better than others the effort involved in lumumba is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades if at all production values are first rate on what must be small by us standards budget the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique the screenplay covers lot of ground and does yeoman work in providing great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba life the political side of things is evenly told in linear straightforward manner that teaches not preaches it concentrates on the good deeds of the man if bit as stalwart saint but doesn embellish on larger than life persona the family side of patrice life is handled in several perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child know the intent is to flesh the man out but too short shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba the story as such has lopsided feel about it high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character the actor gives convincing charismatic performance as the multifaceted politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions in true docudrama tradition the supporting cast does not outshine the star complementing his good efforts instead lumumba is solid interesting educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos both it has more intelligence in its telling than anything ve seen out of hollywood for months and give it b+
apparently director tony kaye had major battle with new line regarding his new film american history don know the details of the fight but it seems that he is not happy with the final product and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether ve heard about this kind of thing happening before and it makes me wonder how much input studio has over the films they produce as it is found american history to be an extremely good film not just because of tony kaye focused look at the touchy subject of racism but because of powerful charismatic performance from edward norton it hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton fantastic role in primal fear but here he is now starring in his own film and making himself star norton is one of those performers who becomes his character and his work in american history is one of the very best performances this year he plays young man named derek vinyard skinhead living in venice beach with his brother danny edward furlong mother beverly angelo and sister davin jennifer lien the film opens with flashback in which derek brutally kills two siyah men vandalizing his car we find out that this lands him in prison and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny in the present time of the film danny is in high school and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother much of the film is told in flashback and we see the path that leads to derek adoption of beyaz supremacy when derek is released having served three years in prison he finds that his brother is now full blown skinhead derek however has given up the violence and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid thoughtless people they are intelligent and articulate and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms it hard to make controversial movie and not preach but kaye has found the right note for his material because american history is mainstream film there has to be redemption phase for our main character some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic partially disagree with this because although do not advocate racism in any way it interesting the way kaye presents derek he is loud obnoxious man but he also very smart the reasons for why he becomes skinhead are believable his father was arbitrarily killed by group of siyah men it clear that he passionate about his beliefs and that he not just punk looking for an excuse to beat people up of course it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part it astonishing how frightening norton looks with shaved head and swastika on his chest in addition to getting the look just right he perfect for this role derek requires intelligence depth and whole lot of shouting and norton does it all with ease even when he at his meanest derek has likable quality to him and that gutsy approach when telling story about skinhead what adds depth to the story is subplot in which the principal of danny school avery brooks becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny the other performances are all terrific with standouts from furlong angelo and lien visually the film is very powerful kaye indulges in lot of interesting artistic choices and most of them work nicely lots of slow motion and strange camera angles add to moody atmosphere but like lot of movies lately american history skims past greatness in the last few minutes although the climactic scene is very moving the picture ends with pretentious preachy resolution featuring brief narration from character who was killed for movie so smart subtle up until that point it felt like slap in the face to be hand fed theme in such simplistic way it makes me wonder what exactly tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film perhaps this last scene was the problem it hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with film this good in time when so many movies are timid and weak american history manages to make compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way
for those of us who weren yet born when the 1960 rock rolled around monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies from otis redding to jimi hendrix janis joplin to the mamas and the papas and jefferson airplane to the who this documentary is jam packed with contagious energy but give fair warning that will reveal the ending which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time sure some have painted their faces and smoke joints but pennebaker the war room moon over broadway surprisingly chooses to show broad spectrum of the audience no matter who is watching it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul the excitement starts before the music even begins young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer she replies that she feels lucky to do so there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers tries to get in touch with dionne warwick and when one band is tuning up member remarks finally decent sound system you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn about vanity it about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it two way street this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience it impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being ball and chain and while the lyrics to wild thing may not be all that complicated watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love even if you don recognize every band you see on stage you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats the only drawback to the film is the ending which unfortunately must reveal all the other bands big names then and still today got approximately to 10 minutes of screen time in contrast the last band on camera wholly forgettable one gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time for film that only 78 minutes long that too large of chunk especially when previous acts are much more stimulating all in all monterey pop is precious rare look at time period that still holds sway over us the variety of music as well as the beautifully shot performances are easy to become immersed in if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular this is quickly dispelled it almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn get made much anymore instead we re stuck with nsync the backstreet boys and jennifer lopez all of whom should have stuck with modeling
if there one thing in common about all of hollywood major studios it that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures fox searchlight and fine line respectively it obvious there no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater so when movie like gary ross pleasantville comes along wrapped in blanket of innovative ideas and served up on platter of fine production it welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted pleasantville should not be mistaken for no thought movie quite the opposite is true in fact as director ross skillfully brings narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen the story both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation captures the essence of statement making in the cinema not in recent memory has movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross work it is still testament that his picture was considered worthy enough kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who through quite bit of luck find themselves zapped into fifties sitcom named pleasantville maguire as the reserved bud parker is perfect for the pseudo world but the rebellious mary sue witherspoon is not at all made for the father knows best times it not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end and begins to teach the townspeople in quite unlikely way what life is really like soon hues of color creep into the siyah and beyaz world and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism others fear the strangeness at one end is soda shop owner turned painter named mr johnson jeff daniels and at the other end is close minded mayor walsh and his chamber of commerce but the two sides are simply fronts for clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town fine performances are turned in all around maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and walsh in his latest and final posthumous performance daniels brings an atmosphere of awe inspiration and hope to his character whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman envy for daniels it his most commendable performance of the last three years or more and for walsh it complementary exclamation point on fine career also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish there not much to dislike about pleasantville and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don
when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago the image of traveling throughout the stars has become commonplace image when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars we see constellations meteor showers and cool space ships when han solo goes light speed the stars change to bright lines going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point cool _october sky_ offers much simpler image that of single beyaz dot traveling horizontally across the night sky was it really only forty years ago when sputnik was launched and that before then no satellites ever existed have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see then technological achievement even though it was from the russians it sounds hokey but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam played by jake gyllenhaal determined to make dent in the space race he becomes transfixed with his desire to make rocket that could fly like the best of them it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket when lovely teacher miss riley played by laura dern suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair we know exactly who is going to win but the joy in film like this is in the little details for example homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class if he has any strengths whatsoever it is an undeterring vision and good organizer it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school who knows more about rocket science than he does it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property that is the entire coal mining town he must walk eight miles one way just to set up the rockets which will fail fail fail and fail again homer+s dad is played by chris cooper favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ instead of organizing union rallies he is the head of the coal miners who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year note how multi dimensional his character is he is his son+s last nemesis as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams but he truly loves his son and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how through coal mining because of his character we can see how far we+ve come the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at rate far faster than any generation before us we don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise family the paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet and he knew of no other life so _october sky_ far from being merely feel good inspirational film offers much food for thought and this is the best type of inspirational film the one that you take something with you btw the final image of the film is just as simple is as strong contrast as the aforementioned horizontal moving beyaz dot against the night sky background another commonplace image to be sure but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago
after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film you will never eat bowl of ramen the same way again there is scene where an old man is teaching young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles as master would teach an eager apprentice you caress the noodles with the chopsticks he says then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying see you soon of course it meant to be parody but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with certain degree of sobriety you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat not something you like not something you enjoy but rather something you experience experiencing it is process which engages all of the senses fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts trust me you really want to go find noodle shop at this point juzo itami tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western set in modern day japan stranger goro tsutomu yamazaki comes into town and finds tampopo nobuko miyamoto the proprietor of small hole in the wall noodle shop trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman pisken rikiya yasuoka goro to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles gets into fight with the ringleader and his henchmen emerging bloodied but victorious goro finds that tampopo ambition is to have shop that people would flock to from far away just to eat bowl of her ramen the problem is her fare is something less than popular and less than appetizing however goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert enlist the aid of wealthy patron and make friends with the former enemy this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems take for example when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for delicious soup from another shop owner the price is too high but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for more affordable sum tampopo meets him at his store late at night and he leads her to back room she protests thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives but he insists just when she is about to bolt for the exit he shows her small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day her face filled with joy that can be felt by the audience this scene while comical is very effective at filling the viewer with sense of trepidation then of relief and discovery there also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to bunch of street people who despite their economic trappings are all gourmets and master sommeliers we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of restaurant and expertly prepares french omelet the scene is meant to bring laugh but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor food is something which everyone has in common and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all there are also number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people lives particularly effective one involves wife and mother being tended to in her home by doctor surrounded by her children she is obviously in her last hours of life her husband comes home and seeing her worsened condition demands that she get up and make dinner the viewer knows the husband intention is not to be mean he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this in near miracle the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares quick meal then brings it to her awaiting family as the family eats she looks on them and smiles preparing food for her family is joy and comfort to her and for brief moment she too enjoys the normalcy then she falls over dead for moment the family is stunned but then the father yells at the children keep eating this is the last meal your mother ever made crying as they do so the family finishes the meal the scene is comical awkward moving and beautiful by including the vignettes itami ran the risk of creating disjointed film but surprisingly they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline instead they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble because the film parodies western the construction of the plot is fairly predictable but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the good guys come together for the final showdown in this case the showdown is against the ramen if they eat tampopo ramen soup and all tampopo knows she has succeeded it pretty obvious what the outcome will be but when film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life you can afford to cut it little slack
what great film what stunning touching heart wrenching heart warming life affirming miraculous film >from its opening moments _life is beautiful_ walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy car with no brakes speeds through the town and guido roberto benigni motions people to move out of the way they mistake him to be the fascist president traveling to their town that day heil heil huh shortly thereafter the president drives through and people stare with blank faces this is standard but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff the clown who is also jew triumphs over the anti semitic society in which he lives granted _the great dictator_ comes to mind charlie chaplin+s almost masterpiece think lib which benigni wrote and directed trumps gd in one essential point chaplin+s jewish barber gives great speech at the climax but to do so he had to break completely from character benigni is given similar situation he is mistaken as fascist dignitary and must explain to classroom filled with schoolchildren on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race benigni+s guido stays in character and delivers the speech keeping the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept it is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema there are many other scenes especially in the first half which are bright and loopy and funny and silly slapstick reigns and although the film is subtitled there was no doubt that universal language was being conveyed and although it+s focus is on the courtship of guido to dora played by nicoletta braschi benigni+s real life wife silent undercurrent creeps in this is clearly racist society evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others and it will soon affect him and his family the second half of the film takes place five years later in an unnamed concentration camp where guido dora by her insistence and their five year old son giosu=e9 giorgio cantarini are deported guido seeing the horrors is desperate to protect his wife and child for his wife who is separated from him he must find ways to communicate to her that he is all right for his son and this is the most controversial part of the film he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game it+s rules include hiding being very quiet and learning to not ask for seconds which raises the big questions how do we deal with pain with persecution with injustice on the worst level it+s said that tragedies bring out the best in people finding strengths they did not realize they had other times they deteriorate become overwhelmed with little strength or incentive to swim sometimes even people giggle in these moments as if there were vacant emotion behind them yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds benigni+s guido realizes this he is the clown but he is not fool he sees the slurs and the vandalism and while feeling the weight of the verbal attacks he still has the audacity to see if everyone around him perhaps even the antagonists laugh his liberty is stripped but not his dignity and certainly not the dignities of those around him it+s obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation but does so with grinning joyful demeanor perhaps that is form of denial perhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster not unlike the very different _brazil_ or perhaps this is an example of great fortitude with no weapons but wit whatever his purposes is subject to debate but also sure sign that this is one of the great three dimensional characters stranded amidst terrifyingly risky concept surprisingly it works it is an important footnote that this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust it+s not that the atrocities are trivialized far from it they don+t have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horror less is more believe that benigni was cautious to preserve the tone and like the theory that it is guido+s alternate reality that we+re seeing however any criticism that this is rewriting history that the holocaust wasn+t as bad as it seems is simply off target benigni+s film has won audience awards at cannes at toronto and is definite shoo in for best foreign language film hopefully for best picture as well he has been made an honorary jew by jerusalem film society it swept the italian academy awards controversy notwithstanding it is one of the great films this year and as of this writing the one to beat for best film masterful miraculous must see
hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death no pun intended honest it shame too because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old movie monsters mean come on are people really going to get that scared over big green guy named frankenstein that moves at speed of five miles per hour hell no and not only was the idea of vampire frightening as hell but it also carried with it kind of sensual feeling as well not commonly associated with horror films and not only has the idea been done too many times but with the possible exception of from dusk till dawn has not been done very well lately either this is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu got to go back to the times when making movies even horror movies was considered an art form and not just done to make cash like nowadays and that is exactly what this film is art ve been horror fan since was eight years old and to this day have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers let me backtrack minute when say intellectual ground don mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to little bit of thinking is involved with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what not you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown those movies could have been made by fifth grader with good makeup kit movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen you see this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore this is thinking man slasher flick the nosferatu of the title is orlock max shreck strange hermit like count that as the film opens is looking for new home to buy he employs the help of hutter gustav von wangenhein real estate salesman or something to that effect who has nice home and even fiancee named ellen greta schroeder upon orders from his boss hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock castle and speak to him about his new home which just happens to be right next door to hutter the next morning he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck not really good sign he then discovers through some reading that the count is nosferatu or vampire one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans but by the time he pieces this together he is too late orlock has already embarked to hutter hometown via boat will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock the character of orlock is of course dracula the only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker novel just thought that was an interesting little side note probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing copy of arrow entertainment digitally restored cut now available in stores however this version is quite different than maunau original masterpiece the movie is now sporting new soundtrack by band type negative and color tinting much like the 1984 version of lang metropolis now really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here bringing classic like this to the attention of wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one but alas like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen but that just my bag you may like the newer more modern version better either way suggest investing your money in copy if you like what they have done with it pop it in the vcr and enjoy if you re like me just do what ll do during future viewings turn the color all the way down on your television hit mute turn on some bach or mozart or whatever dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made
the truman show paramount pictures running time hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after long wait jim carrey dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen in case you ve been asleep for the last few months the plot centres on truman burbank carrey who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven his life seems so perfect however because it controlled by christoff harris creator of the truman show the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of that right burbank life is being broadcast live to the american public and seahaven and all it inhabitants are inclosed in massive sound stage the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far with an idea so different it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator luckily the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages yet never seems to be dumb carrey movie talking of carrey he perfect in this movie enjoying the best role in his career his character is re inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask 1994 and is completely suited to carrey persona he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode shrieking and being silly but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey he not completely dramatic like the film promises however ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff the megalomaniac creator of the show quiet and well spoken he burns an image into the viewer unfortunately he barely in the film and for the first hour dosen appear at all also disappointing is natascha mcelhone character sylvia she plays the role well but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her the supporting cast is excellent and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect so perfect it creepy the philip glass soundtrack is also superb and is used to great effect during the film peter weir keeps the film going clearly having fun the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card although it is slightly slow to begin with about half an hour into film the pace really picks up and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on roll sadly though the film is practically over when the film is in full steam also concerning the ending it is slightly too ambiguous which was disappointing the screenwriter andrew niccol who bought us gattaca 1997 delivers an entertaining script and manages to keep the plot in trim while christoff plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly they never go over the line which would have been easy for niccol to do also there some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show overall the truman show is excellent entertainment certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces it should be viewed by everyone it offers something to every member of the audience and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed overall rating= review by david wilcock 1998 you know for kids norville barnes
since 1990 the dramatic picture has undergone certain change of style now instead of emphasizing feel good stories replete with characters of noble virtues the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times as 1993 schindler list shows most of today mainstream drama however creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience that why pictures like october sky which are throwback to the good ol dramas of yesteryear are such welcome relief in contemporary cinema the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam jake gyllenhaal teenager in the 1950 company town of coalwood west virginia it well known fact that the only boys to make name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships the rest grow up to work in the coal mine the mine which is run by homer father chris cooper is not the place for homer however after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 homer feels connection with the outside world as he puts it anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing did drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast homer begins to construct rockets with the help of their history teacher miss riley laura dern and several mine workers the four are soon bound for great things october sky is skillfully crafted film and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston johnston whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as death star trooper in star wars certainly knows what he doing here he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into plot that is straightforward and robust he does not push any barriers but instead adopts conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film charm his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers or the silent struggle between homer mother and father the cast is well chosen although the true bright spots are the supporting roles laura dern jurassic park lends strong performance in the role of the history teacher giving the boys the support and guidance they need her role is instantly likeable chris cooper the horse whisperer as homer father is less likeable even downright despicable at times but his turn here gives gravity to the movie he definitely driving force in homer life and his more humane moments give the piece certain dynamic that is commendable the script is generally cheerful projecting the boys endeavors in lighthearted manner there are moments when it becomes predictable such as the train tracks scene and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist it highlights the essence of youth however and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps october sky should be success with audiences although it doesn have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she all that it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards it welcome change to the dramatic genre and one that everyone should see
for many people procrastination isn problem to overcome it high art we ll do just about anything to put off task when the deadline for this column nears it the only time during the week dishes get washed and the bed made and laundry done and plants watered and eventually hopefully sometimes there breakthrough and we actually get down to work amazingly it almost always easier than we dreaded and after finishing that sense of oppressive apprehension melts away and then the next time we do it all again english professor grady tripp michael douglas is master seven years ago his first book was hit he been working on his second short 200 page piece since then fearful that he can live up to the first he can bring himself to finish it no writer block he nearing 000 pages with no end in sight now he having particularly difficult day the college annual writers conference is bringing in accomplished novelists reminding tripp that other people are finishing _their_ books during the first day his wife has left him his married girlfriend informs him she pregnant and his agent is in town with six foot transvestite in tow by the evening our besieged writer is driving though the snow covered streets of pittsburgh with suicidal student beside him stolen jacket that marilyn monroe wore on her wedding day in the back seat and murdered blind dog stuffed in the trunk this could be pivotal point in his mid life crisis and then there the next morning there lot to like about this movie there are no huge explosions shattering glass or computer generated dinosaurs to distract from the very real human issues grady is caught up in the curse of people who accomplish great things early in their career in the world of what have you done for me lately he knows his second book has to be better than his first instead of finding out he drifts comfortable in the insular cocoon of academic peter panhood he doesn have much of life and neither does his star pupil james leer tobey maguire james may be suicidal and psychotic certainly everything that comes out of his mouth is lie he makes up past of working clash anguish because the truth of wealth and comfort just isn interesting enough as the weekend progresses they are both forced to fully engage life that the question they must face comfort or real experiences the film takes some interesting chances non traditional relationships are presented as matter of fact extra marital gay interracial professor student here they aren judged merely choices the actors are all first rate douglas triumphs playing against type as he spends most of his time disheveled unshaven and clad in pink women house robe maguire disengaged alienation works perfectly here robert downey jr as grady agent livens up his scenes director curtis hanson confidential makes few missteps the women are underused frances mcdormand does good job of her limited role of sara grady married lover but we never understand much of who she is the chemistry between the two of them is non existent which makes some of the ending unconvincing katie holmes is student with major crush on the professor but her character goes nowhere we never even see grady exiting wife this is very much guy film the varied relationships between the men are much more convincing than any of the others grady alternating mentoring and rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film not him and sara as the boomers age expect to see more mid life crisis films to catch the attention of that demographic eventually it ll probably become cliche but right now we ve got winner ll finish this in second right now have to grab some paint noticed some trim in the other room that needs little touch up michael redman has written this column for so long that he made mid life crisis career choice
the fugitive is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made it takes realistic believable characters and tells an exciting story that totally believable throughout this isn an over the top action flick for the sake of action this is an intelligent adventure story with real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly harrison ford stars as dr richard kimble man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder but is not told in straightforward manner we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble perspective hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble wife helen sela ward was murdered we don get to see who the killer is until much further into the story in fact we might even have little doubt about kimble innocence ourselves the film doesn spend much time on the details of kimble trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to fantastic train wreck but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated it is actually suspenseful to watch this movie is so incredible because it able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives from the moment he appears we know huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other most of the film deals with richard complex investigation as he tries to find the one armed man who killed his wife ford does not have lot of lines here so it is stuart and twohy script and davis outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits disguising himself and doing his own detective work is very interesting we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed so as he learns more so do we meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down at one point they run into each other and great chase ensues but richard is just too smart for them he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor there is great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo pantoliano and biggs roebuck they are trying to catch what they believe to be dangerous murderer yet they constantly start up small talk with each other making funny wisecracks and one liners but not in any kind of distracting manner the final act concludes with another terrific chase richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him and although we get typical fight scene the case is far from solved the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along and we don realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together maybe the finally scene is bit much but it still has believable atmosphere to it we re so relieved when justice is served it not the plot is that makes the fugitive great it all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story watching seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous if only hollywood could produce more movies like this 10 31 96 29 97 13 97 [see also nick of time
very bad things is the most delightfully morbid film of the year movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that couldn help but be won over by the material the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for bachelor party in las vegas the groom to be is kyle fisher jon favreau who is about to be married to the controlling wedding obsessed laura cameron diaz the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd christian slater quiet charles leland orser and brothers michael jeremy piven and family man adam daniel stern after wild night of gambling boozing and drugs stripper carla scott who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room but after freak accident to everyone terror she is killed as robert puts it there are two options go to the police and go to prison or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her after security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body robert is forced to kill him as well okay there is only one option now you can forget about calling the police he says by the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer most of them are overcome with guilt which sets off an even more elaborate series of event that includes much much more murder double crosses and the inevitable wedding from hell very bad things which is actor peter berg feature film directing debut is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that there something about mary wanted to be it pulls out all the stops to create something fresh original and hilarious even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence gore and slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end the screenplay also written by berg is to put it mildly very funny and courageous during the second act of the film some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death which was beginning to undermine the humor but it eventually recouped itself with climax that has to be seen to be believed the dialogue is edgy and inventive and this film proves that movie doesn necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable there more fun think in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here and has lot of fun in playing the hateful laura who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that really do think she deserves supporting actress oscar nomination come next january by the time she is beating someone to death with coat hanger and reciting lines like stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs couldn help but crack up at how balls to the wall this film had become jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original as daniel stern wife who late in the picture we discover is tough kick boxer that should not be messed around with it is at this level that very bad things was so entertaining and surprising just when you thought you could predict what was going to happen there would be little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky the last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over the top although enjoyed the film immensely let me make this clear very bad things is not movie for everyone it is more tasteless than anything have ever seen it is more violent and bloody than rated film usually is and it is offensive luckily these are elements that would prefer in comedy since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making no holds barred politically incorrect comedy the fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and safe wide releases coming out lately still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry
warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest craziest and hard hitting movie in his career based on story concocted by himself and also written by beatty bulworth gives good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system beatty stars as senator jay bulworth who going through nervous breakdown after hiring someone to kill him he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what _really_ happening in american politics much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy platt instead of everyone hating him the american public love him however inside his party more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin and he also strikes relationship with siyah girl nina berry it remarkable that this film was released at all much more open than the rather subdued primary colours bulworth barely gives the american politic system good name the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny and also somewhat true it great that beatty isn afraid to let loose on subject talking of beatty he excellent in the role of the demented senator clearing having fun and seeing warren beatty have fun is rare sight indeed even in dick tracy he was the most straighten face actor then again he was the only characters face we could completely see the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping which he does with gusto and also quite well and seeing beatty as homeboy has to be seen to be believed it nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself second best is oliver platt as the flustered coke snorting assistant who goes over the top when he finally snaps halle berry is fine and sexy as the intellectual nina who comes to like the senator also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit strange accent laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she also played and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife who all contribute to the fun and this being political film the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance as shock himself the writing and directing both by beatty are above par the direction is very nearly sitcom like but suits the film perfectly and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well the script is funny and the raps are actually well produced and humorous and quite clever they re not cringe inducing at least the script makes many points about society in america today and isn afraid to make any bold statements about what is flawed system best of all the film is thought provoking but directed and written in such way that the film feels as light as feather and is very entertaining there also great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes bulworth is film with many advantages and few flaws perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see 61 year old man rapping but beatty does it so well it irrelevant in fact there very little against bulworth except for the language which is very heavy but then again it should be expected bulworth then is well worth watching david wilcock review 1999 you know for kids norville barnes
it was with great trepidation that approached +mary+ the farrelly brothers+ latest film knew the film would be funny the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy went to see but also knew the film would be an equal opportunity offender attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon figured the film would be raunchy maybe another lucky escapee from nc 17 hell may laugh but would feel better in the morning needn+t have worried +mary+ is the sweetest warmest all out laugh and grossfest this side of _animal house_ surprisingly the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making touching romantic comedy on the side and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers they make laughter the toughest job for filmmaker to do look easy the plot is typical thirteen years ago geeky ted ben stiller lucked out in having dazzling mary cameron diaz go with him to the senior prom as luck would have it on that very day he was hospitalized why shall not tell but assure you it isn+t pretty he hires private investigator to find her pat healy matt dillon he becomes one of the great comic villains upon finding her he too is lovestruck and so pursues her lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped it is only matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double crossed and goes to get her for himself would the geek get the girl puh lease the ending is pure hollywood no surprises there but the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers hair gel the mentally disabled the physically handicapped interracial marriages homosexuals skin conditions serial killers tanning and drugged up dogs the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame and yet for all the targets that are hit the film maintains its sweet tone mary playing the straight role is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful she is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother warren earl brown miles away from the cameraman in _scream_ mary+s sunniness carries the film here it compliments the below belt gags that come at you cameron diaz makes her totally charming and the audience respects her even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window ben stiller also fares very well totally changing his image from his _reality bites_ and _flirting with disaster_ straight men to being how to say it complete loser braces greasy long hair not too bright and very very funny dillon is exceptionally creepy especially with his capped teeth and rounding out the cast is ted+s friend dom chris elliot tanning addict magda lin shaye modern troubador greek chorus ron lichman and mary+s sweet mom markie post where has she been not everything works chris elliot+s role skin blemishes and all becomes merely tasteless and boring there+s lousy dialogue about eight minute vs seven minute exercise tapes and there are long stretches without much going on but the wait is worth it when those extraordinary sequences hit the entire theater erupted with howls tears belly aches that in some sequences carried over to the following scene the farrelly brothers have finally done it yes there are some raunchy bits but when it is all over it+s not nearly as bad as it could have been while tasteless it didn+t cross any lines at least not with me while raunchy it wasn+t nearly as bad as _porky+s_ or _boogie nights_ and it is sweet enough to be considered date flick after the funny but sour _kingpin_ left negative aftertaste in my palate comes the funniest sex farce since _a fish called wanda_ approach this with an open mind and you will reap the benefits hugely
fully loaded entertainment review website coming in july didn really expect very much when rented stuart saves his family the movie bombed at the box office and had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based my real concern though was the general reputation of snl related movies translating to the big screen with less than stellar results half baked anyone was surprised to discover truly entertaining often hilarious yet also touching little film it is an al franken production through and through who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture for those of you who don know al franken plays guy named stuart smalley who has really annoying show on public access station about increasing your self esteem etc although not licensed therapist stuart smalley is as the program proudly boasts graduate of several 12 step programs stuart is doing well enough with his tv show but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles stuart relatives are mess his dad and brother harris yulin and vincent onofrio respectively are alcoholics his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce and his mom is in constant self denial and solves all perceived problems by baking then disaster strikes stuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked he is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself and there the comedy truly picks up franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes but as sharply drawn real people although smalley dad has always imbibed too much stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy also after an accident towards the end of the movie both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought although filled with small very funny scenes stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments especially towards the conclusion for lightweight comedy it handles these scenes especially well often better than many so called serious dramas of today all the more amazing is that such movie comes from saturday night live sketch that is essentially one joke bit if you feel like renting comedy and you haven seen this film definitely recommend you try this one out you ll laugh you ll cry it all there
the thirteenth floor the third in what would call the reality check movie series is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year the matrix and existenz all three made you think made you wonder what is real what isn and if our world is just huge game the thirteenth floor doesn reach the level of originality creativity and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz but it certainly gives great shot at it in the matrix we were told that the humans are simply virus in existenz we learned that our life could be just game in the thirteenth floor we learn that we are just electronic devices living under another world of electronic devices there is just one world on top of another and everything in them are fake and electronically generated the thirteenth floor took huge risky turn that didn expect it to take and not very sure it was such great turn to make rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film the thirteenth floor becomes murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller played by armin mueller stahl douglas hall played by craig bierko man that worked under fuller for many years must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using to the year 1937 which consists of computer generated characters only the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days all of the people involved are just characters or are they douglas strongly believes that character traveled through the transport from their world to ours and killed fuller along the way douglas interacts with many different potential suspects and woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller jane fuller played wonderfully by talented young actress gretchen mol the thirteenth floor is plot driven movie from the time the film gets going and doesn use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer interests was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz and wouldn enjoy it but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film unfortunately many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened the scenes that aren original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere leaving you wondering what is the point of this sometimes it was hard to believe that this story with terrible dialogue some bad acting especially from craig bierko and scenes that go absolutely nowhere are actually true know this isn true story or anything but film should be able to make you think that it is on the plus side of acting we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor armin mueller stahl in the thirteenth floor he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances another plus is gretchen mol realistic performance creating her character with depth not just staying in the one dimensional phase don expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile and shuts you down like any other movie would thrills chills and spills aren what you will get in this film but you will just get another trip to send your mind on scrambling it until you ve had enough the bottom line let hope this is the last of the reality check based movies for awhile
steven spielberg amistad which is based on the true story of group of africans who revolted on board slave ship then were captured and taken to america where legal dispute ensued over who owned them is concerned with several different aspects of this story first the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery second it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins last and most importantly it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade amistad succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements have to admit that was little skeptical as to how much could really get out of another anti slavery movie having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery doubted that there was much didn already know about it fortunately turned out to be wrong for one thing spielberg camera never once gets near southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders operations in africa so amistad was dealing with different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning and some of the images here are in fact much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery one scene in the middle in which the crew of slave ship dispose of some of their excess slaves by throwing them overboard to drown has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than was expecting he would and in fact he probably goes about as far as movie director can without getting an nc 17 rating the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only small child at the time exposing politicians as narrow minded opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff of course but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just simple exercise in audience manipulation the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time such that john quincy adams and probably other politicians like him who clearly disapproved of the practice was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court the biggest success of amistad is probably the characterization of cinque djimon hounsou who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin matthew mcconaughey the lawyer who represents them in court through cinque we are given window into the native culture as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for proper burial of dead tribe member or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ cinque sees the dispute with clarity and simplicity that again contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles what kind of country is this where laws almost work he asks baldwin in bewilderment when he learns that the case must be re tried before the supreme court spielberg direction tends little bit towards the manipulative side at times such as when he adds heavy orchestral swell to cinque angry outburst in the court room still there isn enough of this for it to be serious problem the main flaw in this film which prevents it from earning four stars is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can quite handle all of these issues at the same time so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie this summer contact for example dealt with several issues at once but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and most importantly all of them were resolved at once amistad tries to pull it all together in the end with speech from adams but it somehow feels little forced and in any case the speech itself which lasts almost fifteen minutes wears out its welcome about halfway through perhaps the best way to describe it is this amistad is three four star films edited into one almost every individual scene works but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence and thus is less than the sum of its parts however can honestly say how it could have been done differently and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still very good film and thus recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery

the happy bastard 30 second review big daddy happy gilmore as father of course that the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy movie that passable but isn really considered some of sandler best work he doesn actually play happy gilmore in the movie but variation of him he sonny coufax man who living off settlement he got for cab running over his foot and his one day week gig as tollbooth man tollbooth willie his girlfriend kristy swanson is fed up with his lifestyle and demands change before she leaves him enter year old kid who mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate jon stewart who off in china on business trip from there coufax basically acts as the kid father teaching him different things like peeing on the side of building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks he even manages to use the kid in sort of con game to get the attention of beautiful law office worker joey lauren adams but somehow he also garners the attention of social services who aren particularly pleased with coufax actions as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid the reason say it not really sandler best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of movie showing some odd feelings that somehow didn really belong in sandler vehicle mean it fits the movie tone and everything and sandler handles it well but it just oddly placed that all fortunately it doesn destroy the goofy glee path it been following and it still makes you feel good sandler does good job here as he does in most of his movies rob schneider however is irritating as his friend an immigrant delivery boy who can read stewart in his minor time on screen is great and adams remains joy to watch look for steve buscemi as well as homeless bum he hoot directed by dennis dugan director of happy gilmore the movie remains good couple of hours to pass the time with again there are faults but hey everyone needs to get emotional sometimes
there was lot riding on this movie everyone even moderately interested in the scream series was dying to know how it would end what would be the final act this is the end of an era for them movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies and for kids under 17 those elaborate plots consisting of buying ticket to one movie and hopping into scream while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only year or two older than themselves no need to worry scream is endlessly inventive and entertaining fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson household name reinvented the horror genre and continued in the self referential post modern tradition of quentin and co so how does the story go as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe sidney prescott neve campbell now all grown up and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress but rather in upstate california living understandably alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems she works at home as crisis center affiliate over the phone but that not where the movie starts off instead in tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar and conceptually horrifying sequence in eye for an eye 1995 cotton weary liev schreiber now big star drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls demands the location of sidney home and when he doesn get it threatens the life of cotton girlfriend christine and cotton can do anything to stop him the rest of the sequence is particularly clever setting up constant throughout the picture the killer has high tech electronic voice changer that tops that of the first two not only does he sound unmistakably like talented voice over artist roger jackson ha ha he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters including sidney and the returned gale weathers courtney cox arquette and dewey riley david arquette at the same time stab the third film within film based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college has taken less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro whereas the account of the first two films was true the franchise within scream has now become totally fictional nevertheless we learn cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production as himself to be killed off in the first scene so it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie either the actor portraying them or the real thing sometimes both clever indeed but who goes next no one knows three different scripts were penned we re told to keep the true finale off the internet nod to the scream fiasco few years back and no one knows for sure which one the killer read still all the while sidney stays concealed in her home only visiting dad for the first half hour of the film while also having horrifying visions of her mother which takes us back bit to sidney fear of becoming what her mother was or at least what her mother was secretly when sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent she chased onto the set of stab wandering through woodsboro written and directed as an odd surreal nightmare indeed this is one of scream finest moments okay over the years ll admit that ve become quite the scream fan no don have the ghostface costume or the director cut laserdisc but often find myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films yes said dramatic element sometimes debating with family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with scream throughout the film though noticed much more subtle approach than the other two films granted that there stabbin plenty going on throughout but there considerably less blood less gore honestly like this approach it more classical more rebellious constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven he knows when to hold back and at the same time makes the movie ooze with energy illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years of experience some critics have noted that scream seems to take itself more seriously this time maybe so or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger arlington road who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts saw an opportunity for true irony maybe even little bit of satire if the film worked in few more clich what puts damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film afraid is the ending or rather the identity of the killer it does the job guess accomplishes what it should bringing the three films full circle but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears little too contrived too arbitrary after second viewing which endeavored upon due to this recurring disapprobation the killer identity still seems little too random but his motivation came across more sound this time around and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying all in all scream does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of trilogy it is not the worst of the films as trilogy scream was lot of fun refreshing humorous offbeat almost sad to see it go but then it does seem best to quit while you re ahead and scream does fine job of providing closure to its characters for now scream holds the title as the finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid not too shabby
although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama the sopranos analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be good movie in it own right billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol who new patient happens to be gangster boss paul vitti de niro ben wants nothing to do with vitti as he about to get married to laura macnamara kudrow and having gangster as patient wouldn really help but ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out all done in comic fashion of course although never brilliant analyze this is also never rubbish which makes for fun ride billy crystal who hasn had good role since city slickers way back in the early 90 is given role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act he pretty funny while he does it and although his character is little close to his character in city slickers he pretty funny robert de niro is hilarious as vitti playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny he serious gangster unaware that he is comic altin mine lisa kudrow barely seen as crystals estranged wife to be basically reprises her phoebe role from series friends which is getting rather tiresome and doesn come off well on the screen the supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas and are all funny caricatures especially vitti bodyguard jelly joe viterelli the film genuinely plays like proper gangster movie but with laughs instead of hard ass talking it sometimes gets little bloody for light hearted film but it strangely fits in spoofs are made of famous gangster movies including nice parody of the godfather the italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun there also some odd plot points fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason it is true that analyze this has had somewhat chequered production history and perhaps the plot points were expanded in earlier version of the script unfortunately this is hollywood so we will never know harold ramis best known as egon from ghostbusters has deft touch with directing comedy as shown in the immortal groundhog day and the less immortal caddyshack all the comic potential in scene is dug out and presented to the audience the script written by ramis along with peter tolan and ken lonergan starts off funny remains funny for the most of the film but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory the film is short however and just before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into rather rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll analyze this is good comedy and is certainly worth watching robert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it even though it does seem forced or like parody although think this was intentional crystal is his most likeable in years kudrow is given as little screen time as possible which is good thing and de niro is just awesome it no goodfellas and it probably won be remembered as much as groundhog day but analyze this is well done comedy that won leave you feel cheated
perhaps it time for me to say little about my reading habits really do like to read and ve enjoyed many books in my lifetime my problem is that slow reader and not very dedicated ll enjoy portions of book and then set it down for months at time it taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina even though loving the book in addition to this typically don read anything created after the 19th century the only reason bother with this bit of information is because feel bad admitting time after time that haven read any of the books on which these films are based the only exception believe is great expectations however don think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film needless to say haven read the elmore leonard novel out of sight on which steven soderbergh new film is based can say how faithful of an adaptation it is or if it lives up to leonard vision can say that it terrific film with sharp acting great dialogue and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh it certainly nice distraction from 1998 lineup of brainless blockbusters all hopelessly wishing that size mattered out of sight proves that it doesn had originally written george clooney off as one note actor incapable of depth but occasionally showing little flair after seeing his latest performance in this film ve changed my mind this guy can act but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those $20 million superstars here he plays jack foley middle aged guy who robs banks for living he does it because it fun think but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won start he goes to jail which is interesting only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend buddy ving rhames we re then introduced to karen sisco jennifer lopez marshall who conveniently is waiting with shotgun as jack escapes fortunately they take her hostage and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety the central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible we soon learn that the film is not told in sequence and since this is gritty crime comedy flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise at first kind of felt that it was gimmick but guess it was gimmick in pulp fiction too it fun gimmick though and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally ve only seen few of soderbergh films was impressed both with kafka and sex lies and videotape but think he excellent at what he does he an artist without making it obvious and without being pretentious which is always admirable he uses tricks yes lots of freeze frame stuff here but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film as said clooney is terrific and he matched by lopez lopez is of course beautiful but she can act too can sense that she honing in on her skills for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome turn the two actors have arresting chemistry with one another the best scene in the film by far is the seduction scene the brilliance of this scene is also due in part to soderbergh for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in bar to the physical act which takes place few minutes later the scene is series of soft nuances and glances layered upon light dialogue and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema meaningful and engrossing the supporting cast is strong led by the always reliable ving rhames dennis farina who plays karen father is good as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain steve zahn who plays jack nearly brain dead accomplice glenn steals all of his scenes and that in film where every scene is already at high level all of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently constructed script by scott frank out of sight is certainly light film although there are few heavy moments that will linger in the memory overall can recommend it simply as great entertainment not every film has to change your life and it nice to see movie that uses the art to tell great story and simply to entertain its viewers as for the book this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at
upon arriving at the theater during the opening credits took my seat and prepared myself for what appeared to be hellraiser meets the crow but as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue describing the strangers and their reasons for contacting human beings was hooked there was something especially compelling about the nature of his voice knew from the start that was going to witness the actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the character sutherland played the role as true veteran upon the completion of his monologue the camera arrives on sutherland in such fashion that you can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography would imagine for film of this caliber that maximum hours of work were spent where they were needed the most the film flowed beautifully as was being taken through the intricate regions of the dark city clever plot began to unravel to the point where the last time had seen such clever plot twists were in the usual suspects not to mention series of special effects that would make james cameron literally turn green with envy but if you re not exactly the biggest sci fi fan caveat emptor get ready for the atmostpheric darkness of 12 monkeys or the crow without the boredom or depression the concept of the plot is as mindstretching as 12 monkeys was however so be prepared and be sophisticated and imagine picture that finally does justice to the comic book gone feature film fad that hollywood has recently become abusive of dark city simply puts spawn to shame in fact during the climax of the film couldn help but feel the strong presence of an akira esque explosion throughout the general feeling of the movie so my initial predictions were wrong this film is anything but the meloncholy of hellraiser parts one through five never one to base film entirly on special effects so know that when give dark city it actually because the film contained all of the neccessary ingredients to keep me entertained and awake from storyline to plot twists to camerawork to even tsk tsk special effects not since contact have recieved such deep insight into the way the human mind operates and never this year have been so blown away the best film ve seen all year and easily one of the best ve ever seen
the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy but after diasappointing films such as godzilla and fear and loathing in las vegas it would be nice to see really good film but doubt you could have expected this the truman show is one of the most unique films have ever seen and it deserves spot on the decade best list there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim yes that what makes this film great the blend of peter weir masterful and in many ways brilliant direction peter biziou stunning photography and jim carrey performance is what makes this film work so fantastically there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect carrey has made very wise choice by playing mild mannered truman burbank he allows himself enough room to be comical and therefore not alienating his true fans while still showing vulnerable and human side that is side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes truman burbank was born to an audience of millions he was chosen before birth to be the focus of 24 hour television show everything in his environment is controlled by team of technicians led by the show director christof played by ed harris everyone in truman life is an actor or an extra they are all being watched by millions of people around the globe people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in truman life but he is the only person that is not aware of it the classification of the truman show may be tricky the audience reacted to many of truman revelations with laughter did not laugh much during the film because was so emotionally wrapped up with the character the things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes because what was happening to him indeed what had been done to him his whole life was wrong so is this going to end up labeled as comedy drama it really depends on the audience but to me the truman show was touching sad tale about the extents to which corporation will go to exploit human life for the entertainment of others but above all else the truman show was stunningly beautiful picture with humor heart and scary realism oscar predictions in june are pointless but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of 1997 as originally planned james cameron would be oscar less
one way of telling if film is good or not is by the length if film is only 90 minutes but feels like 300 minutes then it crap but if film last hours and feels like 90 minutes then it excellent boogie nights falls into the latter catagory the director anderson delivers funny hip yet sometimes violent film which flies along mark whalberg marky mark plays eddie adams seventeen year old with certain gift in the midriff area jack horner reynolds is adult film director who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business after running away from home eddie joins jack changes his name to dirk diggler and starts making erotic movies in the movie business dirk meets whole load of characters which the film introduces very quickly and slickly such as scotty phillip seymour hoffman rollergirl graham amber moore and floyd phillip baker hall and little bill william macy all the characters are well written well played and the audience gets to know them pretty well thanks to the excellent script we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to divorce rollergirls hard time at school and little bills wife who sleeps with everyone except her husband but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing the direction is fast thrilling and never holds up there are some great shots some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences and lots of other neat directional touches the writing is fabulous with some intelligent dialogue some funny dialogue but none of the dialogue is crap like most hollywood films such as the lost world jurassic park 1997 or tommorow never dies 1997 boogie nights really is spectacular feat of direction and writing on par and sometimes betters quentin tarantino films resevoir dogs 1992 and pulp fiction 1994 the soundtrack is also excellent like american graffiti 1973 the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack which heightens the atmosphere and gives the film an extra lift also the costumes are great the clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties the film although excellent does have some flaws firstly wahlberg although excellent cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry in both scenes where he has to act angry his acting is so off the scenes tension and anger is lost but the rest of the cast are excellent burt reynolds is brilliant julianne moore shows real emotion and william macy is great aswell but he always is another flaw with the film though is that the ending seems bit tacked on it seems anderson saw the film was going on bit and needed to wrap up quickly it shame really as the rest of the film is perfectly paced but they re small niggles really boogie nights is an excellent film superb directing writing acting and music all combine to make one spectacular film whatever you do do not miss out on boogie nights
living out loud is the type of motion picture we don often see it is film about mature intelligent adults instead of the usual american film in which children basically dress up in grown up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven year olds judith holly hunter fortysomething living in new york city has been having difficult time with life lately she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband martin donovan who had been cheating on her she cannot sleep haunted by terrible memories often imagines off the wall things to try and make the world seem like better place and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers liz bailey queen latifah perform at local club judith life does start to brighten little when one night when she gets home to her apartment late strikes up conversation with the elevator operator pat danny devito lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently both of them create sort of emotional connection with each other seeking comfort with the other person but while pat starts to form deep love for her judith only wants to remain friends living out loud which was written by richard lagravenese the bridges of madison county who is also making his directing debut here is wonderful film from beginning to end one that is honest genuinely funny and poignant the three central characters that of judith pat and liz are all written to be free thinking complex human beings and are all likable but flawed people who are constantly interesting as is the film itself one highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen sometimes it results in comedy and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching one sequence that stands out is when judith is at restaurant by herself reading novel an older woman comes over to her mentions that that is great book she is reading and then goes over to join her own friends as the woman sits down she looks over to see judith by herself and motions for her to come join them instantly we realize this was simply in judith mind as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends holly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here hunter of course was brilliant in 1993 the piano for which she won an academy award but in this film she is even better think she finds the right note for each scene and holds it and devito has never had such humanistic role before which was surprised about usually he is used as the butt of joke or as caricature but in this film has living and breathing sympathetic person to play topping it all off is latifah also singer who is quickly turning into respectable actress herself and has juicy natural supporting role as in some ways judith role model another joy of the film is that it does not somehow form contrived happy ending but in staying with its realistic tone manages to be upbeat but truthful the last shot is an especially powerful image nothing is said but just the image of someone walking down sidewalk says it all the relationship that results between judith and pat is true to life and sincere as we watch these two people talk and get to know each other all that we wish for them both is to be happy even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved and as living out loud which is one of the best films of the year proves sometimes friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for

reflecting on bedazzled lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of pathetic loser one sinful thought remains in my mind if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley who portrays the fiery demon then use that pitchfork and point me the way with her pouty lips irresistible british accent and wild display of haute couture hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation it practically impossible to turn this beelzu babe down her next target is elliot brendan fraser tech support geek who is clumsy awkward and just too eager to please to aptly picture him you would have to remember saturday night live skit featuring steve the copy guy who effortlessly irritated his co workers with his unpolished social skills eugene thus is loathed and feared by his co workers who do their best to stay out of his way yet beyond his annoying mannerisms he lovable oaf he wishes that he could get closer to allison frances connor co worker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him however the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as snowball chance in hell dear god he prays would give anything to have that girl in my life guess who then shows up she makes an offer that is too hard to refuse seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul there even an escape clause if elliot wish doesn go exactly the way he likes he need only beep her one guess as to what the three digit number is and he gets to start over the remainder of the film consists of elliot various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth power fame and allison love but when he makes sweeping statements such as want to be very very powerful and very very rich and married to allison he ll soon learn that the devil is in the details for example and we ve seen this several times in the trailers he is granted his wish but finds out that he columbian drug lord and that allison while married to him has her eyes on someone else apparently the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul his other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that short circuits his new life soon elliot wishes that he had never made that deal given the mischievous nature of the devil bedazzled has many amusing moments lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in great comic performance he ably assumes various personas his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world allison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her hurley also heightens the humor quotient especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one it clear that she having good time with it all yet while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story but that would be playing with fire what they ve got works so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is

it is simply amazing how the green mile developed in its three hour running time based on the stephen king series of the same title the film starts out painfully slow with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue however as the plot begins to progress the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction frank darabont who masterfully followed prisoner story in the shawshank redemption this time follows the perspective of prison guard paul edgecomb tom hanks through edgecomb experiences on cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner the green mile is successful in creating sympathy for kind hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb the ensemble acting in the film is perfect hanks david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson sam rockwell and michael duncan hutchinson playing percy wetmore cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie every time he appears on the screen the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor not only because he did wonderful job as wetmore but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks rockwell an independent film veteran plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection as prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill duncan does wonderful job playing frightened child like behemoth very similar to lennie small in of mice and men his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause his pain creates pain for the viewer however it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film the film opens with ridiculous present day setting which contains scene that jabs at the jerry springer show the scene containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief as the film flashes back to 1935 graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is the scene is neither sad nor convincing greene is not even given final word like some of the other characters and we don even see him walk the infamous green mile however as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters such as coffey and eduard delacroix michael jeter as well as the five prison guards the film becomes more interesting the speed in the green mile is perfect if time was matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film great amount of love or hate is attached to each character the green mile is so good following the rough beginning that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene fighting back tears was difficult task that barely succeeded in doing if you survive the first third of the green mile sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment
one never quite knows what one is going to get with mamet film his american buffalo is set bound piece that has very little plot sometimes he will tell story that really moves heist is mamet doing his most entertaining work unlike his the spanish prisoner there are no lapses in credibility heist is probably the best mamet thriller since house of games it is the kind of plot with which you are never sure who will double cross whom and frequently it is mamet double crossing the viewer watching the film team getting around security the viewer is frequently asking himself either what the heck are they doing or why didn anybody think of that before appropriately enough heist opens with very clever jewelry store job it is so clever that one wonders if mamet really thinks up all these ideas himself or if he has help from professional magician and con expert ricky jay now regular actor in mamet films this is robbery that works like well oiled machine there is just one problem and it is enough to get joe moore played by gene hackman filmed on security camera now joe has to get out of the business it was coming time anyway joe team including bobby blane delroy lindo fran moor rebecca pidgeon and pinky pincus ricky jay is going to split up and go separate ways but crime boss bergman danny devito is pulling the strings and he says that joe and his people have to manage one more robbery and he has to take along young kid the short fused jimmy silk sam rockwell immediately it is obvious that there is more going on than meets the eye much of what distinguishes heist is mamet dialog remarkably it serves double purpose the robbery team sounds at once very professional and at the same time it has mamet special feel for dialog hackman has lines like everybody needs money that why they call it money mamet timing is perfect in the direction but terrible in the production the plot is coincidentally lot like the plot of the recent the score which is in fact very similar story both are good films perhaps for some of the same reasons but at least on high level they are much the same story the other problem with the timing of heist is that it involves airport security and clever ways to get around them saw the film at the toronto international film festival on september 12 2001 that made the subject matter just little too timely my understanding is that the release will be delayed my biggest problem with the film is that rebecca pidgeon acting at times seems very poor it is some kind of mamet trademark do not understand to have women talk without inflection as if they are just reading the words for the first time it is an irritation and distracts us from what is otherwise very good thriller it is one rate an on the to 10 scale and high +2 on the to +4 scale
in the company of men made splash at the sundance film festival because in year plagued by brothers mcmullen style earnestly shallow gen angst pictures it seemed to be actually about something it angered people started arguments outside the theater riled things up it ignited spark of excitement in what otherwise has been disappointing year for independent film having endured my share of the hype waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein reside and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about does men live up to its press well yes it does and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office for the uninitiated newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to remote branch office for six week assignment chad and howard are archetypes examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business chad is the blond golden boy genetically engineered for success the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder howard is chad boss but he is weaker of will the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent we first meet them awaiting their flight in drab airport lounge there chad suggests scheme worthy of shakespearean villain he and howard will find vulnerable single woman at the branch office woo her simultaneously win her love and then dump her the reason both men have recently been dumped themselves and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex it ll restore little dignity to our lives he says howard helpless against the force of chad will agrees to the plan they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine stacy edwards fragile deaf woman working as temp chad moves in for the kill flashing his golden boy smile plying christine with lunch then flowers then dinner howard follows suit though his efforts are in contrast ham handed and desperate flattered to have the attention of two eligible men christine dates them both you can guess which one she falls for soon tragic lovers triangle develops christine loves chad chad loves himself and howard loves christine on the grounds that since she handicapped and shy she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high does it in chad writer director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film hannibal lector may eat human flesh but chad is an eater of souls his evil is as subtle as viper and as easy as his smile we watch in stunned disbelief as he back stabs coworkers humiliates his subordinates and works his deadly venom into christine heart his character would be joke if he wasn so chillingly real all of us have worked with chad and some of us may be him he the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness if one of his co workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with bag full of handguns he had best have his escape route clearly in mind politics is his game and the modern cubicle filled office is his playground men wears the guise of siyah comedy but it functions best as allegory the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates siyah temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company then forces him to prove it in manner won describe the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril could it happen in the real world probably not taken as allegory however it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society maybe it just the english major in me but chad in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard can be seen as symbol of unbridled capitalism of greed without conscience the entire film is metaphor for social darwinism only the strong will survive the marvel of labute multi layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way but does the film work as entertainment its darned funny in spots particularly in the men room scenes which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions it works less well as drama since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers stacy edwards gives measured dignity to christine and succeeds in making us care for her but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her likewise chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions by the end of the film you ll feel as if you ve met genuine monster in chad perhaps we can also classify men as horror film certainly those expecting conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed but the picture is often mesmerizing and the script is work of fine craftsmanship which makes it well worth your time like all good films it offers myriad of parallels to the outside world while watching chad in his moment of triumph couldn help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs there may be little bit of chad in all of us but some of us have taken chad ness to the level of art
ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about group of friends vacationing in cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon the book of the dead bruce campbell stars as ash who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods and his friends who have become demons including his own girlfriend the results shown on screen are amazing considering the film tiny budget constant location changes and filming schedule that was sporadic over two years followed by two sequels evil dead ii 1987 and army of darkness 1993 the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it original aspect ratio of 33 the disc contains two versions of the film audio stereo track and newly remastered dolby digital included are two separate running commentary tracks the first features writer director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film star bruce campbell campbell commentary is informative and extremely witty as he has story to tell for virtually every scene in the film such informative tidbits include the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it title and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard also there scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to tape recorder which they ve found that explaining about the demonic forces in the woods for that scene it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana so being the wacky kids that they were at the time they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor had never smoked before and as result they became confused and were unable to perform the scene wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi rob tapert audio track the two people you think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all don get me wrong here when they do speak it entertaining to hear but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask have anything to say sam to me that not good sign also it seems like sam raimi doesn remember much about the film and it production well compared to rob and bruce anyway also included on the disc is photo gallery which includes pictures from the film gala premiere and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film this raw footage really shows you how much film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques overall the evil dead is good low budget horror film superior to many films in it genre and the collector edition dvd release is well worth your time if you re either fan of the film or just fan of the filmmaking process all special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining
martin scorsese kundun which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure personally don think it needs one it works perfectly well as study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do as larger than life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences but his portrayal is appropriate for film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal the set design and cinematography are outstanding and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao political art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans kundun does not it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative
was anxious to see this for long time friend of mine recommended this to me because he has crush on neve campbell and he wanted to prove that she as hot as he thinks he is he proved it for me all right but the reasons enjoy this film go way beyond that scream treads on familar ground horror movie with as star neve campbell puts it some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can act who always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door it very familar your typical horror film so why you may ask after watching it does it seem so new and original because it treats itself as if it hasn been done before and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old familar tired stuff this raises another question how does it do this simple the characters they re not your typical stupid horror film victims who don know what the hell to do when being chased by guy in ski mask and machette they are horror fans they know how stuff happens in horror movie they know what to do and what not to do and that makes it scary and even funny at certain times you can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker drew barrymore is making popcorn getting ready to watch video and some guy who sounds like killer calls her up to play game with her that involves horror movie triva that if she gets it wrong will get her and her boyfriend killed she knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions she just can answer his final question what door am at and that gets her killed that scene works because in normal horror film half the things that happen in that scene would never happen the plot is typical horror stuff sidney prescott an impressive neve campbell an attractive young high school student who mother was killed year ago tommorrow is being stalked by killer who previously murdered one of her classmates casey naturally and everybody in this small california town is suspect including sidney boyfriend billy loomis but as said before these people know how horror movies work and that what makes it so appealing that and the references to horror movies like when casey says the first nightmare on elm street was scary but the rest sucked which is obviously director wes craven who does good job of poking fun of the genre that made him legend patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others and when tatum sidney friend mentions the director wes carpenter which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven but also director john carpenter the cast is well chosen neve campbell pulls off good heroine and unlike most horror film heroines she can act drew barrymore does good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the film and david arquette is impressive also good and funny in his role is henry winkler the fonz as the school principal took half point off for the unnecessary albeit limited appearance by friends courteney cox as reporter gail edwards sidney rival because she covered her mother disappearance hate that show hate those actors they re untalented overexposed and overpaid imho and would think wes craven is smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough but suppose he isn

recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years it was period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood but of all the experiences that collected throughout those tender years can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex yes more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster for all teenagers it almost like rite of passage and what we did was sometimes downright nasty sometimes funny and sometimes shocking and all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer `american pie is comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year just how great are their hormones raging one of them notes after watching disney the little mermaid that ariel is soooo hot the four schoolmates are kevin oz finch and jim kevin is the only one with steady girlfriend but doesn want to have sex until the time is just right but what is the perfect time there is just no way to know and that frightens him oz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive he joins up with jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages finch is the phobic hermit who doesn stand chance with any girl so he pays someone $200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess suddenly girls are lining up to go out with him but among these friends it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful when he has chance to romp with pretty exchange student his inexperience comes shining through he has much to learn and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge this may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom apple pie in scene that is completely shocking raunchy yet unbelievably funny the one thing that want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r rating there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there something about mary was gloriously ribald in fact at first this film received sinful nc 17 rating before couple of more cuts finally brought it down to teen accessible rating but guess after seeing the no holds barred coarseness of south park this seems tame by comparison teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest but unlike many teen sex comedies there is genuine intelligence at work here these are four normal boys who have natural curiosity about sex their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences they know what they want yet temper it with responsibility but almost always it impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster and it these episodes that make `american pie such carnal delight to watch
capsule this is film that avoids easy answers wilhelm furtwangler then the world greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis what were his views was he war criminal or secret resistance fighter how much did he know about crimes against humanity the us government investigated him after the war and this film is dramatization of that investigation high +2 to +4 in my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo sunshine film that covers the fortunes of jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes hungarian aristocrats nazis and communists szabo follow up film german production is much more limited in scope it is about the post war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them ronald harwood screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich maj steve arnold played by harvey keitel has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler stellan skarsgard perhaps europe greatest classical music conductor when other artists fled germany furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen after the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes he secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty from there we follow him and learn little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra as he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point to conspiracy against his investigation there is certain sameness to the responses that he is getting perhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed if so perhaps he can never come to the truth in large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler where the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous it has no obvious resolution and not much of final act when it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation perhaps that is better than so many films that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe but it is like watching murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is we are given clues to something but they are never tied up in the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler the film is basically stage play the visual is not very important corners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location as with stage play what this film centers on the dialog and that is intriguing rate the film an on the to 10 scale and high +2 on the to +4 scale [there is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice at one point we clearly see arnold desk calendar say jan 16 tues quick mental calculation told me that combination could occur in 1945 and then not again until 1951 the events had to take place in 1946 or 1947 possible date could be obtained from any world almanac
gattaca represents solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science fiction films it genre picture that doesn rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story the movie takes place in futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction this allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color intelligence and life span they like for their child and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects those made the old fashioned way are labeled as in valids and confined to the lower rung of society vincent freeman ethan hawke is one such person born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in home with his petrie dish molded younger brother anton fed up with being second rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space vincent leaves home and takes janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation everyday he watches as superior folk make his fantasy reality determined to do the same vincent meets dna broker tony shalhoub in funny cameo who sells fake identities to in valids his counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow jude law an ex athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to wheelchair for life for price and the promise of caretaker jerome supplies vincent with his identity as well as blood skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on the job tests and physical examinations this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching time card because of his drastically improved status vincent is quickly propelled to high position in gattaca and catches the eye of comely co worker irene uma thurman on the way obsessed with her own minor heart defect she enamored by his flawless persona she doesn know is lie but on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure the mission director is murdered two ardent detectives alan arkin and billy bathgate loren dean determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca and the sole clue they find at the crime scene one of vincent eyelashes threatens to blow vincent cover and derail his goal even if gattaca were dramatically empty it would still boast sublime set of production credentials the film look is dazzling without ever being flashy first time director writer andrew niccol he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama the truman show demonstrates keen eye for the stylish his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in sophisticated composition that emanates classy retro ambiance an opening credits sequence where skin nail and hair fragments fall in slow motion through colored camera lens displays these combined talents uncannily niccol even utilizes voice over narration device almost always poorly employed in an effective way when it comes to acting the movie is also flawless ethan hawke does magnificent work proving his ability to carry film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level his chemistry with thurman is bit on the icy side but needfully so adding to the setting clinical chill as the bitter jerome jude law has star making presence and it his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core in gattaca series of final shots the fates of vincent and jerome are superimposed over each other and the effect is sad lyrical and beautiful things get little strange as the movie nears its climax when vincent relationship with his brother comes back into view the big dramatic culmination is swim race which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed still the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use of backdrop it successful sci fi without showy special effects it crisp thriller with character driven thrills it futuristic fable without blood and guts even its murder mystery is relegated to secondary subplot ensuring that smart story about smart people and smart science takes center stage although it portrayal of the upcoming century is grim gattaca serves up one of the most thought provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film
not really sure what to think about crash on the surface it cold boring unerotic porn with name starts name director and some cool camerawork mean it left me completely bored unsatisfied and generally kinda weirded out but then again not every film supposed to leave you entertained crash is structured to play like porn flick but with significantly more plot and dialogue while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex we also have skimpy little plot going on mostly towards the beginning and maybe just hair of characterization not to mention the acting is generally pretty good and we don really see lot of the actors completely exposed but what makes it supremely different from porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of henry and june or the just plain horniness of say deep throat not that ve seen it if one was to be made completely hot by this film it would probably mean they were also into the whole auto eroticism thing the film leaves you cold erotically and maybe in many other ways but what it does is present group of people who live on the edge the film opens up on woman catherine deborah kara ungar of the game pressing her bare breast up against car in public air hangar suddenly man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind the film doesnt show all this though even if it is nc 17 the next scene has film director james james spader having sex with camera woman alice poon in an office on the highly populated set of his movie the next scene has the two coming together revealing to us that they re husband and wife and them sharing in one another escapades while the two are arguably freaky people we at least know they love to live on the edge soon afterwards james is driving down the road at night reclessly of course he reading something when he drifts into the other lane and then hits another car face on james is not killed but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat obviously dying leaving the driver helen remington holly hunter in porn also alive the two go through therapy together and when getting out they run into eachother again when james gives her ride home they almost get into another accident and immeadiately afterwards they go to an unbusy parking lot and have little quickie as they were aroused by the accident you wouldn think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish but they run into freaky guy named vaughan elias kosteas and his crutch carrying girlfriend gabrielle rosanna arquette who are also into it vaughan is into living on the edge as they are but he takes it to another level he loves to recreate famous car crashes in one scene he and friend colin seagrave peter macneill recreate james dean car crash without any padding or safety belts and suffer some concussions but nevertheless get rush and the attention of the police soon these five are all having sex with one another be it straight gay or lesbian sex while this is admittingly all bit comical the film is almost like siyah comedy the film does do pretty awesome portrayal of people who main fetish is living on the edge sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents but personally don see connection between car crashes and sex the main connection cronenberg shows us that both give definite rush his car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini masterpieces we re at first not sure if they ll take place but everytime it looks like it may occur we gasp then when it happens we hold our breath the same thing happens with sex although not in the same fashion these people are merely taking it to another level the only problem with the film is that it tad redundant normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and half this goes on for about 100 minutes and it just seems little too long the sex and car crashes are far between one another and the time between them are tad on the boring side there no characterization although it could definitely be argued that hey it porn and we re not here to sympathize but still they coulda cut it down bit but the film is saved with its presentation as well as some other elements the atmosphere is very dark and forboding creating kind of cool weird feeling and there are several scenes are just amazing one scene has catherine and james having sex while she softly asks him questions about being with man which sounds almost erotic the way she says it sequence involving one character death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs and the final shot is shot perfectly creating an image of car crash and couple having sex in front of it despite the fact that she wounded the acting is also pretty good especially for what is almost porn ousting linda lovelace as best actress in porn while james spader is pretty boring he usually pretty intense deborah kara ungar is amazing she speaks all her words in almost zombie like hushes and when she having sex she has blank look on her face not showing the viewer whether she enjoying it or not in one scene she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her holly hunter who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this is pretty good and so is rosanna arquette who adds kinda cool kinkiness to her role but the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone he often speaks as he is out of breath showing definite affinity for his way of life he has great deal of energy in several scenes especially one scene where he taking photographs of picture and later scene where he getting freaky tatoo he and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes foreshadowing later scene kosteas is little known actor his biggest role was casey jones in teenage mutant ninja turtles but here he shows deniro like presence hinting that he capable of bigger roles while hardly enjoyed crash it still pretty intriguing portrayal of group of people who if the exist are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world these people are able to share rush between two completely different entities and the film which doesn exactly pain them in negative light is sucessful in bringing them to light even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out despite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc 17 rating there also an rated version but wouldn even go near that thing anyone looking for quick turn on should just rent regular porno

in some respects rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking the hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone the cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble all chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element the duo must always be completely mismatched the hero has to say some smart assed comment before and after shooting someone however that doesn necessarily make for bad film rush hour is jackie chan first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector 1985 proving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets ie hong kong jackie chan is given much more free reign than before still some die hard jackie chan fans may be disappointed as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes which he views as too short according to one interview this film takes familiar theme of east meets west jackie chan is lee the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with kidnapping case while chris tucker is carter the loudmouthed destructive cop that is `promoted to the fbi to help him or at least so he thinks also another classic notion in action films the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes despite the necessary conventions of action films rush hour is some of the most fun you ll spend and hour and forty minutes watching jackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen continuing to perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks and punches chris tucker familiar from his whiny annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable complementing jackie chan straight laced character however jackie chan still maintains his comic slapstick edge as expected of him and his films perfectly downplaying the `fish out of water routine through his character attempts at mixing into american culture he makes up for the down time his character experiences when he is in action however you ll be amused and dazzled still being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up in this case steering wheel serving tray and barstool jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu chris tucker character may come across as irritating yet is also humorous since he not physical actor to the level of jackie chan he uses his main weapon his mouth hence the tagline `fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west while dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare it is appropriate for the film and still very funny while not necessarily poignant attempts at character development and growth between characters come off surprisingly well lee `knowledge of american pop culture `that the beach boys when contrasted against carter lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick while carter teaches lee hip hop dance moves while rush hour is not at the same level as police story and known in north america as supercop and jackie chan first strike respectively it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr nice guy with its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs it makes for fun film as well it is true departure from jackie chan films as it is missing one common element whiny female co star
it was rainy friday afternoon in columbus when persuaded friend to see matinee performance of mst3k tm he had never seen any episodes of the show and have watched scant few due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes for those of you not familiar with the premise dr clayton forrester beaulieu wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public to achieve this he in the words of the tv series theme which is missing in the movie bumped [mike nelson nelson on the noggin and then shot him into space and is monitoring nelson reactions to the movies he is forced to endure rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions tom servo and crow robot the format of the show consists of nelson servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love the ship on which our heroes are marooned only two things are different in the movie the absence of forrester sidekick tv frank and the slower pace of the jokes this latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke for their big screen outing the producers have chosen this island earth 1954 classic and one of the first sf films to have special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill unfortunately for that film but making it ideal mst3k fodder acting and dialogue appear to have taken back seat to the effects which by today standards are less than impressive nelson co make jokes about everything from japan dominance in the world market to star trek to the state of disrepair of seattle kingdome and most of them work unfortunately the segments set outside the satellite movie theater seem out of place and aren particularly funny but at least they re fairly short the big question about this movie though is why presume it was an attempt to gain larger following to keep support behind the series rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled few months ago but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen there are no special effects to dazzle you no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat and no use of digital surround sound so it seems pointless to spend $8 per person to see this movie when in few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for $3 and not have to sit in room full of popcorn addicts nevertheless mst3k tm provides more laugh out loud opportunities than any film you re going to see this year and thoroughly recommend it to anyone with pulse given its uniqueness hesitate to grade it against other films but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad movies it does well

the rich man wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double where the story and characters are so one dimensional and contrived that you know you shouldn be enjoying yourself but somehow the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things not that it bad it just that it been done before and better in my opinion realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre but it probably the best analogy that can come up with right now you know how when you see spider or something in your toilet striving helplessly to get out and instead of just flushing him you end up kind of rooting for the little guy that basically how felt about this movie mean it not very good but it not completely bad either the wife of the title is josie potenza played nicely by halle berry she is married to tony christopher mcdonald you know the guy who looks like joe piscapo really stressed out businessman who drinks way to much and doesn give josie the attention she deserves cough cough thus she is driven into the arms of another man jake golden clive owen near the beginning of the film josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on vacation to remote cabin in the woods once there however tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details still not quite sure what line of work he in making the best of her situation josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars one night she meets stranger named cole peter greene finally getting meaty role they have dinner together and eventually both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal after learning that she is not happily married cole offers to take care of the problem managing to escape from the psychotic maniac josie returns home and starts reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband but then one night cole shows up and here is where the fun begins from this point on it going to be no holds barred cliche fest ripping off every movie from strangers on train to the usual suspects this is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out and for the most part they re right the rich man wife has nary one original bone in it body but who cares if you re looking for good ol dumb suspense movie you can do much better than this and if you suspense buffs aren already sold it has killer of an ending too
it wednesday march 27 and murder investigation is underway in charlotte south carolina the crime young prostitute elizabeth renee zellweger has been brutally slain one half of her severed body was found in bag at the train station the other half was discovered in trunk at the harbor authority miles away the police duo of braxton chris penn and kennesaw michael rooker are strapped for leads at the moment they have only one possible suspect wayland tim roth wealthy unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such heinous act that the premise for deceiver new thriller from the pate brothers jonas and josh who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave deceiver plays out like mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not so bright cops captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland iq is 151 by contrast kennesaw is 122 and braxton is 102 the setting is police interrogation room where lie detector test is about to be administered over three days as wayland returns to answer more questions the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until inevitably it boils over other plot elements are thrown in for good measure wayland suffers from peculiar kind of epilepsy that can in stressful situations render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent braxton compulsive gambler is deep in debt to local syndicate and kennesaw is haunted by dark abusive side that delights in terrorizing women especially his wife rosanna arquette whom he suspects of being unfaithful the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand the suspect or his questioners deceiver which mostly transpires in dimly lit room and involves lot of smart dialogue has the feel of david mamet play edgy claustrophobic and tense the atmosphere is explosive and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting deceiver has the power to grab an audience unfortunately in the end it succumbs to the need to throw in one last unexpected twist and this is its undoing for while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers it also stretches our credulity too much and raises more questions than it answers it only an effective wrap up if you don think too carefully about its full implications of course the film as whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic police procedure is totally ignored and it almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction not plot details deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute the pates employ number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth final days and hours the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice over by visually showing what really happened moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks the movie obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir drips atmosphere there are some fascinating stylistic touches for example although the setting is contemporary all of the telephones are old fashioned rotary models cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver look some of the things he tries mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow work exceptionally well while others like any of several lazy susan shots seem more like unnecessary visual tricks as wayland tim roth gives the film top performance despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he supposed to be the other two leads chris penn and michael rooker aren as effective both play their characters like familiar types penn performance is uninspired rooker lacks subtlety some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors renee zellweger in role that miles away from her star making turn in jerry maguire brings note of vulnerability and humanity to part that could easily have become caricature rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw wife and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as psychiatrist who entrusted with evaluating wayland condition one of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience plot points aren hammered home and although the ending has its weaknesses everything isn spelled out in bold letters the pates give audience members credit for having brains which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers occasionally gripping and never uninteresting deceiver is fine noir effort
contact is nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan only novel it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway jodie foster we first meet ellie at giant radio telescope in puerto rico where she is part of the seti search for extraterrestrial intelligence project her research is quickly killed however by her highly political david drumlin tom skerrit who disdains pure research in favor of science with commercial applications she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to corporation run by the mysterious hadden john hurt then with that money just about to finally dry up ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones very powerful pulsing radio signal in the movie most exciting and believable sequence ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers then it turns out to be tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before further decoding with hadden help reveals another layer to message containing detailed plans for massive and complex machine it appears that the machine is transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens home world of course the big question becomes who gets to ride it right after who gonna pay for this thing to boil it down ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform apparently to keep godless science from talking to god or something like that then hadden reappears with startling news he has secretly constructed second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie in whom he has taken rather paternal interest ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to dream like place that looks lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father david morse when she returns home no one believes her she was not even gone for one second they say even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours her story is officially discredited although believed by large segment of the public who don even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static eighteen hours worth of static there is lot to like about contact so will highlight those points first ellie arroway is well rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs but that tough standard to meet ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by strange array of father figures her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally drumlin comes across as distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble hadden obviously has affection for ellie but in the end he seems to see her as his creation nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board even palmer joss matthew mcconaughey ellie love interest takes paternalistic interest in ellie seeing her as misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses the film is technically impressive especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in film since the andromeda strain the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme the dichotomy between science and religion this is very real debate but contact boils it down to simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved the film presents science pretty well until the end so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith religious people are presented as shallow caricatures rob lowe plays ralph reed clone named richard rank very subtle guys the voice of the religious right another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine jake busey the only really fleshed out religious person palmer joss is supposed to be minister of some sort but his actual faith is left pretty vague can even say for certain that he was supposed to be christian all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre marital sex the film drops the science ball at the very end when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith in day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist religious doctrine this is exactly the wrong message to send in movie dealing with issues of science and faith the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism what ellie should have said was you shouldn believe me not without evidence and don have the evidence know what happened but you shouldn take my word alone that is the voice of science speaking the character of david drumlin is another problem with this film his attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for person in his position also his profession of faith before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only pack of idiots should have fallen for it the last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles the media figures such as bernard shaw and jay leno aren so bad in as much as their participation was voluntary the use of bill clinton however should give anyone pause first of all lifting the image of sitting head of state and inserting him into fictional story line thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken is just plain creepy also using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001 forever dating it people watching this film in the future will say hey this never took place during clinton term this bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief also the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century better to have had fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all the film does raise an interesting question although it never develops it in satisfying way if we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes belief in god or at least some form of supernatural creator personally would hope not since religion is basically an opinion form of ideology would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task
seven is one of the best mystery movies ve ever seen it extremely intriguing and suspenseful but it also quite fun it serial killer mystery but you don care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer the story is cops on the trail of serial killer mystery someone is murdering people who are offenders of the seven deadly sins fat man gluttony was forced to eat himself to death lawyer greed is slaughtered by his own rich possessions could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much what makes this film so unique is the characterization of the good guys which makes the unseen villain seem so vile brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills the cocky rookie however morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset the wise veteran on the verge of retirement and he doesn get killed by the end there is great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for breath of comic relief this is impressive because the mood is so tense and the fact that it can be down played as well as it is here let alone at all is quite an accomplishment the setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able to give the city feeling of the evil scary place many believe it to be the production design is superb in the spirit of batman and the crow this film embodies the gothic mood the way the words fade in and out along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add lot to the story on subconscious level even the credits are scary the killer victims have no connections at all and thus mills and sommerset don have much to go on to solve the case they can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense we become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown not that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this the only problem had with the film is the way in which mills and sommerset are lead to suspect let just say it seems little too mystery movie or too convenient in other words when they are led to suspect by the name of john doe terrific chase scene ensues this is typical thrilling element but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story if anything this film is the epitome of twist endings don have to tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal but the way in which this happens is surprising there is scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives and even though he obviously insane his charisma makes for some good points what even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to terrific climax as the film resolution comes down to question of what justice really is seven is not just film about crime but about the evil within man john doe felt he was doing society favor by ridding it of scum but as justified as he makes himself seem we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice
deep rising is one of those movies the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god screw that it says boldly let see some computer generated monsters rip into decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to bunch of little known actors heh them wacky monsters gotta love em of course since we can rent about thousand movies with the same kind of story hollywood must give that little extra oumph to get people in theaters that is where deep rising fails which is good thing confused let me explain despite all them flashy effects and big explosions deep rising is still at heart good ol movie luckily it very good movie the worst cliches in movie history are movie bread and butter therefore things that would destroy serious movie actually help us have good time while watching movie of lower calibre of course we know there big slimy creature behind that door that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive we just don know when or how horrible it will be went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high imagine my surprise when discover that deep rising is actually well pretty darn funny at times funny movie well that new these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh except for few unintended laughs once while and before you know it treat williams wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen hey know them guys and gal from couple of other movies cool familiar faces so far so good our man treat is the hero he ll live wes is staple of movies he is the token victim we know he ll buy the farm but he will take few creeps with him on the way out famke is the babe nuff said there is also guy with glasses the guy with glasses always dies siyah person movie buffs know that the siyah guy always dies never fails and very funny nerdy guy ah comic relief how can we possibly explain having to kill him let him live after the first fifteen minutes felt right at home know who to root for and who need to boo too and gum to chew please kill me suffice it to say that for the next hour and half jumped out of my seat few times went ewwww about dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing man we nottice these things all in all recommend deep rising if you are looking for good time and care to leave your brain at the door but bring your sense of humor and excitement in with you the acting is decent the effects top rate how to best describe it put together the jet ski scene from hard rain the bug attacks from starship troopers couple of james bond like stunts and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth and freddy where you keep screaming don go there he behind you and you end up with deep rising for creepy crawly goodness tight shirts major firepower and the need to go to the bathroom every fifteen minutes from seing all that water
david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director with his distinctive more often than not ingenious dialogue and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible some of them tend to be thickly layered deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message or sometimes even concealed storyline and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors it is still brilliantly complex consistently riveting motion picture about honor about sacrifice and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right oh and it rated incidentally this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else work namely play by terrence rattigan set in the 19th century he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow rich aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing shilling postal note did you do it he asks his boy no father didn ronnie answers that enough for arthur who with his oldest daughter rebecca pidgeon immediately starts crusade to bring his son case to court they enlist the help of sir robert morton notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task it all seems fairly frivolous and no matter how you look at it the winslow case is not the trial of the century but arthur is determined to keep his family word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that soon enough sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings so do we all david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue but his style is still fairly apparent the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense but this is not mamet norm and it refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks gangsters as con men wonderful as those films were nigel hawthorne performance is nearly flawless his delivery is that of dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game we pity the man but we also like him rebecca pidgeon david mamet wife who gave fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthur oldest daughter flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as way for making up for her lack of success in the women suffrage movement the winslow boy is wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher it wants to make real impact rather than phony one be honest did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like time to kill if you wanted to but didn this is movie for you it is the epitome of subtlety it powerful without being too emotional sad without even trying to be depressing david mamet can churn out some great scripts but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is hell of director too he is almost national treasure his films deserve their own genre 1999 eugene novikov&#137
it certainly more than just monster story kenneth branagh director actor co writer of mary shelley frankenstein kenneth branagh new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world including the most controversial version of them all directed by james whale the dark and stormy nights the lightning bolts the charnel houses of spare body parts the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful but the center of the film quieter and more thoughtful contains the real story horror fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues morality philosophy and human elements of the story and not on old fashioned horror cliches his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean the year is 1794 bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs as the ice closes around his ship figure appears on the horizon it man exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew his name is victor frankenstein kenneth branagh and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown the myserious stranger begins his tale or more precisely his confession in geneva 1773 he is remembering his childhood and youth laughter banquets and parties happy life without troubles or concerns here victor lived with his father ian holm mother cherie lunghi his surrogate sister helena boham carter and his servants in happiness and harmony this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed like thunder from quite sky his mother dies giving birth to his youngest brother shocked baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair victor already interested in science becomes obsessed with death standing on his mother grave he says oh mother you did not have to die no one should ever die will stop this promiss after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished victor travels to ingolstadt in presuite of medical career after while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night creating life from death composing dead bodies frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man both physically and mentally with strong electrical impulses he managed to breeth life into his creation the result was ugliness realizing what he has done frankenstein tried to undo his work but it was to late the creature has escaped because of the epidemic frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home making plans for the wedding for while everything is as it was before his mother death but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously whale picture although powerful never managed to capture the total depth of the novel brannagh has more or less done that another thing is characters and actors branagh has developed every character and assembled magnificent cast the greatest performances comes from de niro the monster that has been played by among others charles ogle karloff lon chaney bela lugosi glenn strange christopher lee fred gwynne as herman munster and now robert de niro alone hated and feared he is completely aware of his ugliness at first he is like helpless abandoned child desperately reaching out for love later when he reads frankenstein journal and learns that he is composed of dead bodies his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge he is capable of killing without regret took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground and then slowly crushed his neck and as killed him saw your face that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator and yet he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable for the sympathy of one living being would make peace with all rarely has cinematic interpretation of the daemon approached the level of three dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein in most of the previous adaptions he was simply mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates monster god knows why with the power of an electrical storm almost no time was granted on his charecter who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel here branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment and somehow manages to build up to rousing and horrifying creation scene branagh plays frankenstein with remarkable understanding of his character on the outside he is strong ambitious and talented scientist but deep down he is unsecure fragile and vaulerble constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein surrogate sister who at the end becomes his wife for little while before death drives them apart the rest of the cast playing secondary characters is solid and nothing less than convincing visually the film is stunning especially the makeup the spinning camera the constantly building up musical acore the art direction the production design the costumes are all magnificent from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests to the plague riddled streets of ingolstadt mary shelley frankenstein is wonder to behold kenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare all once loved lies in shallow grave by my hand and the film ends exacly as hamlet when the creature sets both his and his creator body on fire the film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness and terrifying last close up on the creature smiling face can man create life then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him to whom are its actions then attributable the creature or the being who brought about its existence shelley did not answer these questions but she certainly posed them following her example branagh does the same his film is tragic saga about playing god victor frankenstein is not an evil man he wanted to change the world to the better in this he represents everything science stands for acting without doubts never considering the consequences of his actions produced by francis ford coppola frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film dracula in comparison can say that dracula has visuals that even frankenstein can not live up to but when it comes to story characters and casting frankenstein is stronger but stronger than both of them on every aspect is neil jordan interview with the vampire although the film is not perfect the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective these minor faults are easily forgivable as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating branagh has probably created one of the best if not the best adaptions of shelly classic novel

sometimes find 19th century british costume dramas little hard to relate to it not the time or the distance it the rules and conventions of social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy yet somehow the movies are all well made and always get caught up in the story the wings of the dove fits the pattern kate helena bonham carter and merton linus roache are in love merton newspaper writer would like to marry kate but kate job if you will is to be member of the british upper class her father lost all of her family money but wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married nice rich man naturally newspaper writer wages don count as rich kate leads him on but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder ultimately because he not marriageable kate american friend millie alison elliot stops in for visit on her way to venice at party millie catches glimpse of merton and likes what she sees kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie he might forget about her it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it he is still in love with kate and will accept no substitute the three of them along with fourth friend elizabeth mcgovern end up on holiday in venice together where their interactions are quite complicated let sum up millie has fallen for merton merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate kate loves him but can marry him so on the one hand she trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy but on the other hand she jealous of them as couple clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick dying in fact at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies millie will leave her money to merton who will then be rich enough to marry kate she lets merton know of her schemes and since it will help him win kate he reluctantly agrees kate leaves venice so that the two can be alone together merton finds that pretending to love millie is lot like actually loving her he not sure he can separate the two kate finds that she not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved without revealing the details suffice it to say that the situation ends badly the title refers to the object of merton vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament one is left with feelings of regret and despair what started as such promising relationship was damaged by greed anger and jealousy an interesting thought struck me after the movie was over and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of film noir couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other and after few things go wrong the whole idea seems like an awful life ruining mistake wouldn call the wings of the dove film noir but the comparison is interesting as have acknowledged before am not wonderful judge of acting but liked the performances from roache and elliot roache successfully conveyed his character ambivalence toward millie near the end he hugs her at first staring into space as if he thinking about his plan with kate then giving that up to fully embrace millie millie part didn require as much range but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion their settings are far removed from my personal experience geographically historically and socially still the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over
nosferatu the vampyre germany 1979 film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson this extraordinary re telling of bram stoker dracula by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore inspired by murnau 1922 silent film of the same name herzog film is work of exquisite bleakness an oddly touching tragedy with beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards the original full length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received video release by distributor anchor bay entertainment and in gorgeous widescreen prints until now only shortened english language version of the film was available on video and only in europe both of these re releases restore the film to its full length but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one everyone knows the story of dracula or do they his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won hurt jonathan harker is young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with creepy count played by klaus kinski who wants to buy house in harker hometown upon seeing photo of harker wife the radiant isabelle adjani he instantly falls in love with her locking harker up in his castle he sets off on long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him upon divining his identity as vampire adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises that is story familiar to millions but herzog has elevated stoker tale into the realm of and use this term tad reluctantly cinematic art nosferatu is as much meditation as it is film shot through blue ish and beyaz filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised the film surreal dream like quality is utterly mesmerising there is much to enjoy but ll limit my praise to few key points holding the film together is kinski remarkable performance as count dracula past screen portrayals including bela lugosi famous turn have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp but kinski oh boy this is something far more compelling aided by startling make up job he portrays dracula vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease this man is dreadfully lonely he lives in utter solitude shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust kinski portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting when he dies you almost feel as if this man tortured soul has been freed at last then there the unforgettable soundtrack largely composed by german group popul vuh it is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it quite impossible to imagine the film without it popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient sounding kind of spacemusic using piano chants and exotic instruments when first saw this film some years ago was so impressed tracked down and bought number of their albums the one still listen to the most is tantric songs from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken it testament to the music depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them the album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies this is timely re release by anchor bay after francis ford coppola unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stoker tale in 1992 it is joy to go back to herzog film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now century old story to some aficionados nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made without doubt it is an unmistakable classic of the genre don miss it

the endurance shackleton legendary antarctic expedition in 1914 as the great war descended upon europe sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica this time to be the first to cross the ice bound continent on foot 28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years director george butler using film footage and photographs from the historic journey tells their remarkable story in the endurance shackleton legendary antarctic expedition the expedition started out as merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse on foot the vast wasteland of antarctica as the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea the entry to the cold cruel continent they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land for months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed stranding the men on the flow propelling them away from their goal and eventually into their lifeboats for safety shackleton faced with desolate situation made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island once on this safe haven shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization he and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the 800 mile journey on the world roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia miraculously the six land after 17 days at sea on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous snow covered mountains covering 22 miles in just 36 hours this ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen in the end he is successful and everyone made it back home alive only to be swallowed up by the ravages of the war the title of this fascinating documentary the endurance is more than just the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world it is also the description of the stamina and ability of every one of the men who survived 19 months of the toughest most grueling conditions on the face of the earth the name of the film is tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather it also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men with astonishing foresight shackleton brought australian cinematographer and photographer frank hurley along on the journey the filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men day to day life the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs the slow destruction of the endurance and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow after the sinking of the ship the remaining film stock with the exception of still camera and three rolls of film had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on considering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the world harshest environments and captured so much on film is feat unto itself hurley created his own account of the shackleton expedition in his 1919 documentary south an interesting companion piece for the endurance if shackleton original idea document his trek across the frigid southern continent had been successful it would have been considered super human feat as you watch the story of the endurance unfold you realize that the disastrous obstacles the sir ernest and his men faced and overcame were even greater accomplishments than the first intent shackleton amazing 800 mile journey in an open boat is fodder for rousing adventure story all by itself there are couple of minor nitpicks with this fine work though actor liam neeson narrates the story but his voice is too soft spoken and lilting for the dramatic tale the nature of the ordeal also concentrates most of the visual material both film and photo in the documentary first half as the crew adventure takes more drastic paths hurley had less and less film stock available to chronicle the awesome events helmer butler and his team fill in the blanks but the treasure of the endurance its film footage is mostly relegated to the early months of the expedition can think of true life adventure that shows better the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds the endurance based on caroline alexander book is an eye opening documentary that goes where few men have gone before and even more remarkably all 28 survivors lived to tell about it give it b+
eric rohmer pauline at the beach is one of those small deliberately paced but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise but lot happens to the characters emotionally the film takes place during few weeks of august at the normandy coast and centers on six different characters primarily pauline amanda langlet wise beyond her years 15 year old who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin marion arielle dombasle on the first day at the beach marion runs into an old high school flame fedoore atkine and although he wants to rekindle their relationship she is more interested in an older more seductive womanizer pascal greggory who is also secretly having an affair with candy vendor rosette while pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults she forms relationship of her own with young teenage boy simon de la brosse pauline at the beach is not film in which big dramatic things occur and there is not clear cut tidy conclusion to the story instead it is picture that simply observes its characters in every day life and the surprises come from little character details the film is quite talky and slow moving and so it is pretty safe to say it isn for those who are only fan of action movies but is treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big budget genre and see good art film this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer 1969 my night at mauds and 1971 claire knee that have seen but his direction is assured and intelligent as is the screenplay which he also wrote pauline at the beach is film worth seeing
underrated movies are common reoccurrence in show business today 1998 hope floats was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year we always get films that make big money at the box office but critics and audiences pan on them this year double jeopardy is one of those films critics are calling it predictable and worthless audiences are disappointed with it and think it was disappointment but as viewed double jeopardy found that it was great movie it has surprising sense of humor and big dose of heart along with heart pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is really good movie the always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons woman with seemingly normal life great loving husband beautiful son and great friend her husband nick parsons has made surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted after night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat her husband is missing and there is bloody knife on deck of course being in shock she picks it up and coast guard comes over and sees her however she isn immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money she pleads not guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years while making phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad which makes libby heart stop right there she realizes she must get out and prove that he isn dead one of her cell mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of crime she cannot be convicted of it again which means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it after she gets out she goes to halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones he is man who has had his share of bad things while out for the day she breaks into school and tries to track down her kid and husband leading up to some jaw dropping twists that are both predictable and not whatever happens the film was excellent to me found the writing well written as well as the acting was great ashley judd is such talented and beautiful actress that she is hero in sort in this movie even if you know what is going to happen in the end you don know how this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen except you don know how they are going to make it happen it could be one way or another it could be this way or that way the movie is highly stylized and extremely well made it gets most of it power from the two leads ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances the characters are well realized and believable and we feel libby pain when she cannot see her child for years even though lot of critics didn like the film loved it the director took his time making the movie and put lot of shadowing in the movie found it not to be boring at all and it only flaw comes from some predictability it moved at fast pace has suspense humor heart and great acting it earns it right to be great movie and to me that what it was
eyes wide shut isn the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick final film but it is an impressive achievement mesmerizing haunting adult psychodrama about marriage fidelity and sex it stanley kubrick film from beginning to end consistently exhibiting the auteur trademark penchant for long continuous takes his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast indeed eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot kubrick renowned perfectionist reportedly held his cast hostage on the set for nearly year in an uncharacteristic maneuver kubrick cast two big name stars in the lead roles namely real life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman they play bill and alice harford volatile couple who during the course of couple nights ponder the validity of the idea that husband and wife must be faithful to each other he is an she unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to fancy party at the affair they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman after smoking dash of weed inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night he truthfully says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse lustful story evidently some time ago she had thing for young naval officer she admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night bill is jolted by alice story and we anticipate his reaction but at that moment he gets phone call and has to go show his face at the house of just deceased patient this turns out to be the beginning of long and eventful night on the town the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down he almost does the dirty deed with kindly hooker who approaches him on the street then through series of coincidences he winds up at gothic mansion where ritualistic and frankly creepy orgy takes place with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other erotic dread mounts as cruise who not supposed to be there wonders the spacious halls watching the action until he is discovered to be an outsider much hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros digitally edited the orgy scene with the help of computer they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts they can still be seen just not in all their glory in order to avoid the dreaded nc 17 rating european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it roger ebert calls the american version the austin powers version and many others have bashed the alterations am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene mystical atmosphere the first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks this is an artful distinctively gorgeous production shot in dark moody hues and featuring some elaborate beautiful scenery from the giant mansion used in the film centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford apartment this film is always pleasure to look at to boot great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still at the core behind the graphic controversial content and unappealing mood this is good natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic it something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve deeper relationship at the end it seems bill eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman tom is completely convincing as dr harford man who seems guided solely by destiny with no control of the course his life will take nicole projects quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective she headed for an oscar nod the movie has some help from similarly strong supporting cast at the head of which is director cum thespian sidney pollock enigmatic and articulate as harford mysterious friend eyes wide shut is not perfect the last hour could have used slightly more scissor happy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good looking for me to believe that either would have very strong temptation to philander still this is an important work from great director and while it may not be on par with some of stanley kubrick best it is worthy final film complex exploration of jealousy and faithfulness 1999 eugene novikov&#137
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned milos forman first film since the ill fated valmont columbia the people vs larry flynt is vastly entertaining if not particularly enlightening biopic of hustler publisher and self made millionaire larry flynt who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s the film unweaves its tale in chronological order we open with young and dirt poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky cut to forward in time where the two flynt brothers now young men are running the struggling hustler go go clubs in cincinnati the strip clubs are in dire financial state and in last ditch effort to salvage the operations flynt decides to go to print shop and churn out promotional newsletter this evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine creating larry flynt vast financial empire and the rest is history what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material and who railed and preached against him flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt and his driven single minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression regardless of personal cost the people vs larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt true love althea leasure whom he meets as dancer in his club and later marries and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations considering the serious nature of the film theme the importance of the united states first amendment the people vs larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light hearted and humourous much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances some of his chosen apparel is hilarious and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity the film focus is on the flynt many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech but the heart of the people vs larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff harsh and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues but with althea we see his loving affectionate side there scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking ultimately the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors but from the strength of flynt and althea love for each other woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly career topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience and very compelling protagonist for the film courtney love plays althea leasure in startling turn completely raw and impulsive it very solid performance brash and naturalistic and love is extremely compelling it difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen and her chemistry with harrelson is dead on edward norton as flynt straight level headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co stars in the people vs larry flynt much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film one can sense the frustration that norton character feels when harrelson free talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind and this results in heightened emotional punch when norton isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges milos forman keeps the film moving although it runs over two hours it never drags and his direction of the film is very effective eliciting great deal of empathy for subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic there also great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot which is both clever and extremely entertaining two minor quibbles with the film it certainly seems like the people vs larry flynt is in rush to get to its main theme with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech consequently the first thirty minutes of the film introducing and setting up the characters seem unduly rushed perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting but felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in more leisurely fashion it also felt like there was distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters the film clearly shows what flynt althea isaacman and rev jerry faldwell did and on superficial level some of their motivations but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on deeper level for example why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton president carter sister to be born again is mystery to me then again perhaps it was to him as well these two points don detract greatly from the film the people vs larry flynt is certainly among the very best studio released films of 1996 and works both as ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression and as touching love story
in the wake of the smashing success of rumble in the bronx it looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii the version have is copy from the laserdisc it widescreen and bilingually subtitled as are most hong kong films these days availability over here in the united states is very limited these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng the subtitling on the copy have is slightly hard to read the letters are beyaz and bit small although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed this review is of the subtitled version so please keep that in mind if you re reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it to be fair must admit that ve never been very fond of period piece martial arts movies the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past perhaps it because most of those ve seen were filmed on inferior stock with either butchered dubbing or all but illegible subtitling or perhaps it because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and in many cases all but nonexistant in fact many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only few minutes before the end or for that matter it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings armour of god rumble in the bronx etc tend to have more spectacular stunts often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts having said that must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is remarkable exception to all or most of the above is one of the better martial arts films ve seen and quite enjoyed it surprised well so was drunken master ii is about young man named wong fei hong played by jackie chan who is master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu where he learned this style is uncertain as his father wong kei ying ti lung is steadfast in his opposition to fei hong practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu apparently fei hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore rather like paul bunyan is for americans but ve heard very little about this and could quite well be wrong so ll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei hong is also featured in the once upon time in china movies but have not yet seen those the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy as are the plots to many such films but if you re watching jackie chan film odds are you aren expecting something on the order of war and peace the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics and hence china cultural heritage while overworking underpaying and beating up chinese workers in nearby steel mill however this plot merely serves as framework for the other main story of the film fei hong perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend supplicate his father keep his pregnant mother played by anita mui from fighting and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs the macguffin that drives the plot is precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners in the beginning fei hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for customer in the process he clashes with another thief who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng after fei hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners lackies thanks to some timely intervention by general son cameo appearance by andy lau who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei hong and his mother attempt to come up with replacement for the missing ginseng and so it goes and the plot thickens later on such as when fei hong girlfriend maneuvers him into kung fu match with rival or when fei hong and the thief now revealed to be loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners are attacked en masse another grand kung fu movie tradition but think ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves let move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies the action there plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie of course in kung fu film that to be expected however this isn just another kung fu movie this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography and jackie chan is genius the primary martial arts style featured in the film is drunken boxing form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk further for the purposes of this film at least drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated but there fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into stupor under normal circumstances the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid but jackie pulls it off with flair the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper so ll just say that the fights especially the big climactic fight at the end in themselves make the movie worth watching another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work even without motor vehicles well not counting train there are some remarkable stunts in this film among other things jackie dives off balcony into table and crawls across hot coals not once but at _least_ twice if you count the outtake shown during the credits quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database unlike in american films these stunts are _not_ faked drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene including jackie ti lung better tomorrow and anita mui the heroic trio series rumble in the bronx the performances are first rate especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film the scene where fei hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei hong father back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious as is the scene where fei hong mother having just revealed that she is pregnant is threatening to hurt herself in order to draw her husband anger away from fei hong jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into sort of mastery over the years and he in fine form all through drunken master ii as far as cinematography is concerned it certainly works for this film it nothing spectacular but is at least dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s the picture is crisp and clear one thing find particularly worthy of mention is that at least in the copy have the screen was wider than any film ve ever seen on videotape before almost whole of the screen was blocked out above and below watch this on bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can it will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan and scanned for american video release drunken master ii shows the full potential of period piece kung fu movies and it good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies the plot does meander bit but that to be expected in this type of film if you like this kind of movie you ll love this movie and if not well give it chance anyway if nothing else the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental
set in the late 80 at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into movie less than zero american psycho puts new spin on the yuppie genre that ellis helped to create christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman high powered yuppie who hides terrible secret from his fianc and his colleagues it seems that bateman is serial killer and unfortunately for his contemporaries his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel was first introduced to the novel when was still in high school read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it as usual when anything is controversial try to seek it out but soon forgot about the novel and didn end up thinking about it again until stumbled across it couple of years later at bookstore picked it up and read it but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers the movie has similar effect but at least it less cryptic than ellis novel for once film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of point to immerse us in bateman impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does as result the film is immensely more entertaining lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films having picked up kevin smith catholic rattling dogma and here with american psycho there is no difference screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make marketable film out of it some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc 17 mainly involving sex scene comprising bateman and two women and initial reports said the film was unwatchable thankfully it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park bigger longer uncut side note #1 co writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill fated acquaintance of bateman who after bateman suggests that she start making out with female prostitute proclaims that she not lesbian nor has any interest in it the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner the writer director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy is lesbian it subtle in joke and it one found to be pretty humorous despite having rather high profile supporting cast of young up and comers including reese witherspoon most of the roles are waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos the real draw here is christian bale and his over the top performance as patrick bateman whenever read novel always try to imagine what it would be like as movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters always had hard time trying to decide who would cast as bateman but never thought bale would deliver performance as perfect as his ends up being to say bale runs away with the character is vast understatement and he proves that he as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger one sequence in particular involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news song hip to be square right before burying an axe in co worker head features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances have ever seen on film side note #2 despite the fact that huey lewis hip to be square and pair of phil collins songs appear in the film don expect to see them on the soundtrack release huey lewis expressly requested that his song featured in rather large set piece in the film much akin to the use of stuck in the middle with you in reservoir dogs not be included on any soundtrack release assuming that collins requested the same on similar note whitney houston cover of the greatest love of all is also involved in scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source apparently houston wasn as open about the use of her song as the others were bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film release that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film don look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more several web sites have been dedicated to the subject but still undecided there is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on killing spree taking out cops old ladies and cleaning staff with equal gusto the scene seemed very dream like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying as an example bateman blows up police car very cinematically after firing several shots from handgun in the general direction of the car kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence though comic throws the film off balance which suppose was the intention other than the few flaws have mentioned american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman reality think this movie is destined for greatness as cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such it may not change anyone life but it will certainly have an effect know will certainly hear hip to be square in different context the next time hear it [r]
rather die today and go to heaven than live to be hundred and go to hell earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher with that line coming from fundamentalist christian minister hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story he will be turn out to be scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american and all of his preaching will turn out to be cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation from elmer gantry on we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church well think again for the apostle which robert duvall has wanted to make for over decade does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister and by implication all the rest of organized religion instead it gives us highly devout man who certainly has his foibles but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god and arguably just as surprising the good spirited film is no comedy even if it does have humorous moments instead of levity the picture takes touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to world not normally seen in motion pictures when in the privacy of his attic robert duvall as texas preacher euliss sonny dewey argues sternly with his lord the scene shares kinship with emily watson character crying out for her god in breaking the waves most powerful scene the body of the story starts with sonny coming upon an horrific auto accident which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters with his well worn bible in hand sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident dying victims the scowling police officer orders him to go away and after he has tried to work his miracles sonny leaves with smile in the confidence that he has done the lord work robert duvall not only gives moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film director writer executive producer and chief financier rarely has movie been such labor of love with beyaz suit peach colored shirt and tie and dark sunglasses sonny looks as much like rock star as preacher duvall has every movement down pat even when he is walking down the street the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy he dances and claps all the way sonny churches having more siyah members than beyaz means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep voiced siyah orators but his rhetoric is always competitive may be on the devil hit list but on god mailing list he shouts to the congregation in revival tent and they lap it up people jump up scream praise the lord and mean it the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable but sonny is no saint it turns out that he has wandering eye which angers his wife jessie played in remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny church leaving him unemployed sonny letting his temper get the best of him does something foolish which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever the bulk of the film occurs in small predominately siyah church in louisiana which he builds up from derelict building with no congregation into remodeled church one way road to heaven holiness temple with an enthusiastic flock in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle the apostle is hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church he asks his members to tithe but he gives all of his money and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks man who can stand to be still he tells one of his friends quit school because didn like recess in his new town he meets toosie miranda richardson who like him has family that she hasn seen in while his romance with the separated woman like the rest of the film doesn follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies billy bob thornton shows up one day playing local racist and general troublemaker his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show many surprising scenes again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take although it probably couldn have ended any other way the movie does wrap things up nicely and don miss the sweet epilogue during the film closing credits tour de force acting performance by duvall and surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film the apostle runs little too long at 12 it is rated pg 13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up
this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989 whether it was the meddling of studio executives or the work of writer director james cameron himself the original cut of this underwater sci fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed the main problem was fairly simple the film climax was unworthy of its build up someone at 20th century fox and no doubt cameron himself must have agreed because in 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss special edition now available on video it seems timely to re evaluate what in its newly revamped state is now near masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010 odyssey two alien and close encounters of third kind the plot is thus we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard nosed lindsay mastrantonio and captained by her soon to be divorced husband bud ed harris the rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of nuclear submarine requiring dive part way down three mile deep trench three navy divers arrive to command the operation led by the edgy lieutenant coffey biehn but series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they re dealing with as she memorably puts it aren speaking russian meanwhile on the surface hurricane is brewing and even worse series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions this crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig with the trigger happy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings on around them the human drama is often riveting with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron aliens the stunts hardware special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding and so they should be cameron technical credentials are well established but what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex hubby bud the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as series of escalating crisis befall them and the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss the abyss special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects one is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay relationship at times touching at others incredibly intense and volatile the second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the film end when the aliens demonstrate their control over water with terrifying and extraordinary display of power to world on the brink of nuclear war with the inclusion of these startling scenes the story climax is now given real weight why on earth were they left out of the original this reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible so then we have 25 minutes of additional footage that turned decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent say quite because some flaws do remain the most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz some new some old that may well have you reaching for the barf bag nonetheless the abyss special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron greatest achievements alongside aliens and terminator see it and be moved gripped and spellbound
it was crazy time in france what with the french revolution right around the corner king louis xv would soon die and his son would become king louis xvi such is the setting for beaumarchais the scoundrel about the controversial playwright spy and playboy pierre augustin caron de beaumarchais beaumarchais was the author of the plays the barber of seville and the marriage of figaro today people think of them as quaint and harmless operas but back in 1773 when the movie takes place they were so scandalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once the movie beaumarchais the scoundrel takes light hearted approach to its subject resulting in an inviting motion picture one of france most expensive productions ever the movie was huge hit when it opened there last year now in theatrical release in the united states it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with romping good story the secret of the film success other than the lavishness of sylvie de segonzac costumes has to be the performance by fabrice luchini as beaumarchais with his glistening eyes and his infectious smile he mesmerizes the camera and the audience his wry little lips seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning in land where court intrigue determines one destiny constant scheming was way of life for the aristocracy as our story starts we learn that beaumarchais has bought himself judgeship into his court comes member of the nobility demanding an immediate sword fight beaumarchais who has been having an affair with the man wife makes him wait until the current case on the docket is decided that over with the fight is on with luchini charisma it is hard to root for anyone other than him audiences may remember him from the marvelous colonel chabert in which he played the attorney although he does not have half of the good looks of his assistant gudin played by manuel blanc he dazzles the women and the viewers with his grace and style michael epp warm and intimate cinematography provides nice accompaniment to jean marc kerdelhue lush but realistic looking sets jean claude petit music especially the hauntingly lovely flute solos make for an enchanting time at the movies director jean claude brisville who wrote the script along with edouard molinaro fleshed out play by sacha guitry which according to the press notes was just series of historic vignettes the disorganization of the play still comes through at some points in the movie but the actors smooth it over with their good hearted style typical of the scenes that come out of nowhere is the one in which rotund benjamin franklin appears in large pot of hot water taking his bath one episode has beaumarchais working with renegade spy who may or may not be man another has beaumarchais using his personal fortune to aid the american revolution all of this may sound like dull historical drama but it is anything but the story plays more like theater of the absurd than movie based on historical facts the radiantly lovely sandrine kiberlain plays marie therese the real love of beaumarchais life but he is so likable that members of the audience may want to compete with her for him still with his beguiling smile one can never quite be sure if you should trust him the movie on the other hand can be trusted to deliver high old time beaumarchais the scoundrel runs 41 it is in french with english subtitles the film is not rated but would be an for some nudity and sex and should be fine for most teenagers

john sayles men with guns is about what happens to society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power the film takes place in an unnamed central american country where the men with guns are the rulers most of the country is divided into tiny segments some are controlled by guerrillas with guns some are controlled by army soldiers with guns and all the spaces in between are controlled by thieves bandits and terrorists all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness however like so many central american countries this one also features modernity there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization skyscrapers hospitals televisions highways etc but it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land or else they are simply ignorant of it the film main character dr fuentes federico luppi falls into the latter category one of his patients an army general describes him as the most educated man he has ever met and also the most naive fuentes is true liberal caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians with government assistance he has trained large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate this program was to be his legacy and he repeats over and over that it was good idea however when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned as he travels deeper into the forest going from village to village the story is always the same the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers usually for helping the other when dr fuentes asks village woman why the army killed one of the doctors she replies simply because they had guns and we didn rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns because others sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power dr fuentes picks up several companions during his journey all of whom are characterized by their loss first there is young boy named conejo dan rivera gonz lez who has neither mother nor father next fuentes crosses paths with thief named domingo dami delgado who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities through his ordeal in the army domingo has lost most of his self respect and defines himself only by his pistol along the way the group also picks up padre portillo dami alc zar priest who has lost his faith as domingo is running from the army so is portillo he has been labeled guerrilla sympathizer and ran away from the village in which he was preaching last the group takes on mute girl named graciela tania cruz who hasn spoken since she was raped two years earlier her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her sayles two major strengths as director characters and setting are abundantly evident in men with guns like many of his films sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room but longer than necessary running time is sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor he creates fascinating complex characters especially dr fuentes and domingo their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film overarching theme of violence as power domingo attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes belief that the revolver is unloaded at first it is but later is isn the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself sayles knows how to bring location to life whether it be an early twentieth century coal mining town in matewan 1987 or contemporary texas mexico bordertown in lone star 1996 sayles is not particularly inventive director he likes to let his actors do most of the work but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak gattaca successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain sayles also maintains strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico using all latin american actors and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects the one exception is couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on few hundred miles south of the texas border it would not be stretch to say that men with guns is depressing film in fact the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure in addition to loss the main characters are also failures at something whether that be dr fuentes failure to change anything through medicine or padre portillo inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being nevertheless it is bleak material sayles has chosen and he deals with it accordingly the last shot of the film does offer hint of hope even in world where as one character puts it nobody refuses the men with guns
melvin van peebles sweet sweetback baadasssss song was watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the siyah movement it was released less than decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of macho siyah hustler fighting back against beyaz oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before in style content and how it was conceived and produced sweet sweetback was cinematic revolution whether or not one agrees with its subject matter van peebles siyah american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france built sweet sweetback from the ground up almost entirely by himself because no studio would dare fund such film he was forced to raise all the money himself the movie ended up costing about $500 000 part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby van peebles cut costs by hiring non union labor and taking on most of the film responsibilities himself he wrote the script scored the music edited and directed the film as well as starred in the central role he was also brilliant entrepreneur who always found way to make an extra buck for instance when the mppa slapped the film with dreaded rating van peebles not only threatened to bring lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa but he also developed little marketing scheme he coined the phrases rated by an all white jury which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film he also printed the phrase on tee shirts which he had no problem selling the storyline in sweet sweetback is deceptively simple it takes place in los angeles and van peebles stars as the title character tough male hustler of few words who grew up in brothel and makes money by doing what he does best having sex one day he agrees to go with couple of amiable beyaz cops down to the station to make it look like they re bringing in suspects on politically charged case involving murder however on the way to the station the cops arrest young siyah revolutionary named mu mu hubert scales who they proceed to beat viciously acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets little old by the end of the film this plot allows van peebles camera to roam the darker side of the ghettos alleys and back street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked van peebles entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid vision of the siyah experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored at the beginning of sweet sweetback he offers this epigraph which is traditional prologue used in medieval times when messenger brought bad news sire these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented but hymn from the mouth of reality van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality not of exaggeration of course with today abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to siyah inner city life as well as films by spike lee john singleton and the hughes brothers sweet sweetback doesn seem all that revolutionary it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made at that time sweet sweetback was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it distributors were petrified of film that in van peebles words gave the siyah audience chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out about rising out of the mud and kicking ass of course once it caught on it caught on big sweet sweetback is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era although van peebles disassociates sweetback from other movies like shaft 1972 and the mack 1973 because those were financed by big hollywood studios sweet sweetback is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the siyah panthers however even if when viewed from an african american perspective sweet sweetback is certainly not without its controversies when it was first released an article was published in ebony magazine denouncing the film while at the same time the siyah panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film he has no political motivations and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs but in personal and selfish motives still others point to the clich siyah potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex illustrated in scene where he gains the respect of beyaz biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm nevertheless movie like sweet sweetback cannot be made without conflicting points of view it is revolutionary movie not because it about one man defiance but because it put front and center siyah issues that had never been dealt with before until that point american cinema was an almost exclusively beyaz domain and with the exception of sidney poitier all siyah actors were relegated to specifically siyah roles that were important only in relation to whites the fact that sweet sweetback was movie by siyah about blacks was something new in the opening credits van peebles lists the starring actors as simply the siyah community van peebles tells an interesting story that goes long way toward defining the difference between sweet sweetback and all movies that had come before it when the movie first opened he saw it in theater next to an older woman near the end of the film when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert she kept saying to herself oh lord let him die don let them kill him let him die on his own it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african american in movie who rebelled against beyaz authority that she couldn even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape and of course sweetback does escape and the screen fills with the message watch out baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues beyond the political aspects sweet sweetback is an entertaining picture which van peebles always intended it to be he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget and produced film that although dated now was technically fantastic at the time he shot in rough documentary like fashion while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him he makes good use of older techniques like split screens freeze frames reversed color schemes and overlapping images the only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment watching sweet sweetback more than twenty five years after its initial release one realizes that it still has bite arguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies but there are still problems that are reflected in this film but there is more to the film than its racial aspect the legacy of sweet sweetback baadasssss song is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african american perspective but more importantly the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him
it seemed wholly appropriate that at weekend screening of the horse whisperer the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to projection difficulties robert redford film version of nicholas evans best selling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december going head to head with titanic but is only now making its much anticipated debut this strategic delay has allowed the horse whisperer to compete sans fanfare against some smaller unassuming movies during relatively slower time at the box office no matter redford film stands head and shoulders above james cameron ocean going tragedy especially in the writing and acting departments whatever the reasons for its postponement the horse whisperer supports the old adage better late than never redford has taken evans book and given it the big screen treatment while parts of the horse whisperer are epic in scope and vision especially the aerial travelogue that maps out this great country of ours its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast when her daughter grace is involved in terrible riding accident hard driven fashion editor annie maclean kristin scott thomas devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and grace beloved horse pilgrim refusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about faith healing cowboy of sorts called tom booker redford who has way with horses and perhaps with people too undeterred by tom initial reluctance to get involved annie drives grace and sedated pilgrim across country to meet him and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal redford film unfolds slowly and lovingly echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds the film little long and even if you haven read the book it pretty obvious where it heading but these are minor complaints redford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other but it scarlett johansson as grace who shines in more difficult role dianne wiest chris cooper lone star and sam neill better than ve seen him before round out the respectable supporting cast and the director respect for horses is clearly in evidence one word of warning however while brilliantly shot the accident scene involving an out of control truck is extremely disturbing redford canvas is huge and exquisite he doesn hesitate to incorporate vast sprawling vistas of the american northwest spectacular snow capped mountain ranges azure skies and shimmering fields of wheat all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson viewfinder veteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is pity since the horse whisperer is dances with wolves by way of out of africa oscar winners both for barry fortunately barry replacement thomas newman contributes fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate human conditions sonorous string laden passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic introspective movements ripe with nuance the horse whisperer is that rare kind of movie it looks good it feels good and by golly it does you good the wait it turns out was well worth it
it not often that laugh so hard at movie that my head hurts but that just what happened to me at uhf weird al yankovic big screen debut uhf is television parody la airplane and like airplane the movie is extraordinarily stupid but it dumb in the best way movie can be dumb it so silly and outrageous it hilarious the movie stars weird al as george newman world class nerd with hyperactive imagination the type who fantasizes he indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns george is basically loser his daydreams and smart alec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto job for more than two weeks but george finally gets chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station george revives channel 62 with innovative programming shows like wheel of fish and movies like conan the librarian as the station ratings rise it comes into competition with channel the leading vhf network affiliate as fletcher channel ill natured hard nosed owner veteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy he really hams it up with his snorts grimaces and scowls uhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television including game shows tabloid talk shows children shows dizzy news women and movies everything from rambo to close encounters the funniest scene the one that made my head spin is commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed like most movies in its genre uhf is hit or miss for every gag that works at least one fizzles for instance weird al mock video of money for nothing by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to grinding halt although it does have some nifty computer animation but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail we know another gut wrencher is on the way in fact uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplane type movie since well since airplane much of the credit goes to weird al exceptionally inventive script and to the movie winsome cast weird al seems little stiff at the beginning but because he not afraid to look silly he ultimately has lot of fun with his character the real standout is michael richards as stanley the dim witted janitor who becomes the host of his own children show stanley spadowski playhouse stanley off beat mixed up personality is big hit with the audience and makes him an over night star he is an endearing mixture of good natured innocence high energy enthusiasm and puppy dog cuteness and above all he good janitor who adores his work another highlight is vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips the cast also features gedde watanabe the chinese foreign exchange student in sixteen candles as the karate master who hosts the hit series wheel of fish also aboard for the ride is fran drescher who plays pamela finklestein channel 62 roving reporter unfortunately as weird al girlfriend victoria jackson is wasted in role that calls for nothing but whimpering whining and sulking her character is extraneous and should have been either further integrated into the story or cut from the script altogether while uhf is not an absolute must see it definitely the ticket if you re looking for wild and zany whacked out comedy the movie is good enough to see in the theaters but it may work even better on television the very medium at which it pokes fun
playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task they wanted to write script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare works they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare mean really who doesn think of shakespeare as guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write play without exploding into passionate introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare and they wanted to make movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare and despite the difficulty of their task they have succeeded shakespeare in love is one of the smartest funniest most touching films of the year it so rare that picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors but here we have movie that defines success it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written it could have been smug self important movie that panders to die hard shakespeare fans but the appeal of this film is almost universal if you ve ever read play by shakespeare or know anything about his life it likely that you ll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love joseph fiennes brother of ralph stars as shakespeare himself he delightful irresistible lad concerned mostly with women and detached from life more serious problems debt plague etc he commissioned to write plays for various people queen elizabeth judi dench wants comedies while local slimeball philip henslowe geoffrey rush needs him to write play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann tom wilkinson shakespeare however has trouble focusing on his work he begins work on comedy about boy named romeo and girl named ethel this all changes however when he meets viola de lesseps radiant gwyneth paltrow young heiress set to marry the financially oriented lord wessex colin firth shakespeare instantly falls in love with her he first meets her when she pretends to be man to try out for the part of romeo he discovers her identity and confronts her later she of course falls in love with him although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare writing so much and soon the production which later becomes romeo and juliet is set to be performed shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film not because it works as great entertainment but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role he has such searing optimism and energy he clearly man who admires shakespeare and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character inability to turn away from women attention deficit disorder we sense great deal of affection and care he practically overflows with passion in every scene fiennes is matched by paltrow whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance ve seen her in the two performers work perfectly together taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh of course it doesn hurt that they have masterful script to work with stoppard whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor all of his plays have similarly dry humor the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play in the movie shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid director john madden does fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of lesser director going to have to see the movie again certain there are numerous references that missed in fact doubt it possible to gather everything with just one viewing stoppard is master of detail you ll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film not as lines of play but as dialogue suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time there also brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly homosexual rupert everett is joke in of itself proposing slightly twisted explanation to marlowe mysterious death in pub there also scene featuring wide eyed dog that is so funny that hurt myself laughing there no dog in this play no no dog the ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe wilkinson is also hard to recognize but has great role as thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously ben affleck playing one of the actors in the company shows great range both in his accent his is almost as good as paltrow and in humor he has some of the best one liners in the movie colin firth always stuck playing the sap does good job being hateful judi dench however has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words my single minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that feel like could have been more moved by the end the story is moving but there are few missed opportunities in the final scenes but my quibbling is not important what is important is that acknowledge the quality of this picture the sheer skill with which it has been written acted and produced shakespeare in love tries so many things and nails every one of them it film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him film in which the actors writers and director are all perfectly in sync it also movie that has the potential to introduce lot of people to shakespeare work in positive way without seeming condescending or superior admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them not just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it
what shocking about carlito way is how good it is having gotten bit of bad rap for not being big box office hit like pacino previous film scent of woman and not having as strong performance as he did in that one he had just won an oscar carlito way was destined for underrated heaven that what it is an underrated gem of movie and what shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it and turn it into great piece of pulpy character study carlito way deals with well carlito brigante pacino puerto rican ex drug kingpin who gets out of long jailterm when his coke addicted curly haired lawyer sean penn points out legal technicality of course carlito was actually awoken in prison and has decided to go straight even if he really crook at heart carlito like barry lyndon is man who is trapped by fate at every turn and can escape into something he is not carlito attempts at clean legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn when he first gets out friend of his ends up leading him into big shoot out where he has to kill couple people to survive he constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he doing anything illegal and his lawyer finds himself neck deep in pile of shit needing him to try and help him out which includes him doing some prison breaking carlito like ratso rizzo wants to go to miami since according to film logic that where it at but needs some funding being legend he is quickly able to get nice job running big dance club this is the 70s by the way and since some of this takes place in night clubs we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics including several and the sunshine band tunes my personal favorite he gets bodyguard the great luis guzman at his best and is soon running pretty good business even if he constantly attracting underworld young thugs like benny blanco from the bronx john leguiziamo who is more than once pointed out to be young version of carlito on the other side the symbol of promise and hope is gail penelope ann miller what happened to her his girlfriend from before prison she goregeous ballerina and stripper and soon carlito is trying to get back with her and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami while this relationship is never fully defined or anything we get sense of love between them and they have some truly interesting scenes between them she never gives him addresses or locales he always has to track her down all of these elements clash together at the end in brilliantly executed emotional climax which is inevitable when say inevitable mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack putting great spin on it sure it going to eleveate some of the tension but it gives the film lot of depth as carlito is seen trapped by fate what amazing is the big chase sequence amazingly done by de palma has lot of tension and thrills like apollo 13 we know what going to happen but we re still thrilled by what happens in the middle it also very emotional thanks to great script by david koepp and amazing performances by pacino and miller de palma is famous or infamous for lots of violence in his films his earlier flim scarface which starred pacino in the lead has ton of it especially at the end and nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which still not over but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes to me the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of building looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet this is the most brilliantly done and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film and probably the best in de palma film history with gorgeous soprano duet in the background and rain pouring down onto trashcan lid covering carlito head and saddened remorseful look on pacino face it tear jerker well for me dunno about you the acting from all is great especially from the three leads pacino was panned for his performance chiefly because his accent wasn puerto rican enough and well it wasn as strong as his oscar winning role in scent of woman well his scent of woman performance was great and all but it was nothing really but as comic kevin pollack said foghorn leghorn impression in carlito way he emotional and strong despite the fact that he remorseful over his entire lifestyle which he cannot change felt more for carlito brigante than did for the tango dancing insult throwing blind guy in scent of woman as said penelope ann miller is great and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry and they re scenes are well written with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship and sean penn is amazing as the coke addicted rat attorney every scene he in he has great energy and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino in smaller roles john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great carlito way is one of those films which you heard about briefly but when you finally watch it you re absolutely blown away it wonderful film highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn do so hot but trust me and check it out it great little film and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right
devotees of robert heinlein be forewarned paul verhoeven starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein novel than it is literary satire the author jingo all the way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting soulless faceless parade of carnage from the film version and suppose that exactly what verhoeven delivers with sometimes hilarious results heinlein basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become source of amusement while their strengths become the stuff of high energy entertainment outlining the plot of starship troopers is fairly silly endeavor since it basically big bug hunt aliens in broad daylight sometime in the future humanity is threatened by giant malevolent insects which have evolved into twenty foot tall action figures arachnids with super impaling spikes beetles that spew forth lava dragonflies with guillotine legs among those who sign on to save the earth are group of high school classmates from buenos aires conflicted rich kid johnny rico casper van dien his math whiz girlfriend carmen denise richards dizzy dina meyer who secretly carries torch for johnny and carl neil patrick doogie howser harris who not so secretly carries torch for dizzy and also has talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets while carmen heads for flight school and carl joins military intelligence johnny and dizzy become mobile infantry their various battles intertwining with romantic sub plots out of third season episode from beverly hills 90210 so if starship troopers is another movie where one dimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing bunch of aliens what makes it any better than say independence day movie where one dimensional characters waded through trite situations on their way to killing bunch of slightly different aliens for one thing you sense that the film makers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material the very absence of major stars in the cast feels thematically appropriate not just fiscally prudent if starship troopers had been turned into tv movie aaron spelling would have produced it it story which requires emoting not acting it prime time soap opera with big guns played for all the dopey melodrama it worth the no name cast also plays into verhoeven treatment of heinlein most controversial conceit in this society we learn one can only be full citizen after completing some sort of federal service military for most verhoeven pays the notion plenty of lip service then proceeds to skewer it with brilliant mock recruitment ads named after the world war ii era why we fight series in which youngsters are indoctrinated into the joys of firearms or the pleasures of stomping cockroaches these characters really are just fresh meat for the grinder as one character puts it which makes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting it not that starship troopers is anti military because it never treats the true horror of war as anything but great big violent video game in fact the characters are living the propaganda particularly johnny who receives so many field promotions he may not remember his own rank by the time the film ends verhoeven is actually having it both ways he making fun of gung ho boosterism even as he fires his fresh faced recruits into battle on gung ho booster rocket of visual effects if that makes starship troopers hypocritical at least it enthusiastically staged hypocrisy there may not be person worth caring about in the whole film but it moves like nobody business verhoeven stages some thrilling action sequences sending swarms of bugs after the anonymous grunts then having various body parts strewn about the screen like landscaping it is that rare special effects blockbuster which demonstrates sense of pacing to match its budget was caught up in the action enough of the time that wasn perpetually groaning over the absence of real human beings wish could find it in myself to work up more outrage over the callous way humans are dispatched in starship troopers but it didn work out that way that would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart of his material
is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all time it quite possible his career spanned over 40 years and he acted in more movies than most actors ever could yet when he is talked about in the media he is generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role the nice guy and that really shame the naked spur features jimmy stewart in role completely different than what people would expect from him it western which stewart specialized in around this period and it casts him as desperate man out to collect bounty on man who used to be his friend before he finds that man though he runs into two men who agree to help him thinking he is sheriff when the criminal is eventually caught the two men discover stewart secret and decide they want piece of the action too the rest of the film is suspenseful journey in which each man suspects the other constantly also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal well played by janet leigh we re never too sure who side she really on until the end leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the shower lady from psycho and that unfair she gives strong performance as woman who is pulled between these two men stewart gives performance unlike anything ve ever seen from him he usually keeps cool no matter what occurs but here he gets downright hysterical at times think perhaps he took this role to prove to the public that he was more than just nice guy his performance borders on psychotic at times but loved watching every second of it it roles like this one that make me admire him as much as do he was an actor unafraid to take chances and even ruin his public image
almost full decade before steven spielberg saving private ryan asked whether film could be both anti war and pro soldier john irvin hamburger hill proved it could lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone platoon this excellent film was dismissed as too militaristic it hard to understand exactly why unless irvin in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable and often naive reasons chose to show up for the vietnam debacle has refused to present us with the stone killer drug stoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what the polack the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn became to wwii movies hamburger hill based on true story is not an easy film to watch there is scene that will have graying anti war activists squirming in their seats or moved to genuine tears and the climactic final assault on the hill in question is visually confusing gristly realities are presented in brief flashes as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered and in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee veteran and newbie siyah soldier and beyaz become almost indistinguishable from each other as they do in the chaos of actual combat the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney vance as doc in role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as seaman jones in mctiernan kirmizi october if you ve seen private ryan you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill if only to determine that the all the valour and horror of spielberg vision was as present in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach
when andy leaves for cowboy camp his mother holds yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys one of these toys is wheezy penguin with broken squeaker woody tom hanks saddles up andy dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy woody succeeds in his mission but doesn make it back to the house before al the unscrupulous owner of al toy barn recognizes woody as rare collector item and steals him buzz lightyear tim allen leads hamm john ratzenberger mr potato head don rickles slinky dog jim varney and rex wallace shawn into the city to find their friend meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped al has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950 tv puppet show woody round up except for woody doll now that the collection is complete al plans to sell woody and his round up gang bullseye the horse jessie the cowgirl joan cusack and stinky pete the old prospector kelsey grammer to toy museum in japan the gang is happy about the move they ve been in storage for years waiting for woody if woody doesn go with them they ll be closed up in dark box again possibly forever trying to convince him to stay with them jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up and woody realizes that his days as beloved toy are numbered while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy buzz and the boys invade al toy barn where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn know he toy the new buzz generates the movie biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on zurg fortress al apartment building the original toy story won me over because its central themes reflected grown up sensibility rather than the usual this is what we think kids want to hear while most kids movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill in toy story buzz discovered that he wasn special that he was just like everyone else buzz sank into suicidal depression but woody showed buzz that being toy was worthwhile because toy is loved and toy makes child happy in other words it okay to be ordinary if you have love and purpose in your life most of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we re not space rangers and we re never going to be toy story addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded abandoned or sealed up in dark box in the attic this is another big grown up theme everything ends the theme is introduced early in the movie when woody arm is torn and andy places him on shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp on the shelf woody meets wheezy who dusty broken and forgotten the other toys are shocked that woody has been shelved and they worry that woody ride out to the 25 cent box at the yard sale is suicide attempt after he stolen woody has to decide between long life in display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals of course in spite of the heavy themes toy story explores it also very funny most of the laughs come from the toys assault on al toy barn and on the apartment building the brief substitution of new still delusional buzz was welcome surprise wondered how sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original most of the vocal performances are first rate tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work however one voice over also stands out as horribly miscast kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector although he does lot of voice over work in commercials and on the simpsons as sideshow bob grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice he doesn have the range to pull off role like stinky pete the animation is even better than in the first especially impressive were the textures of the figures we can now see the difference between flesh and plastic in the first movie the people looked just like the toys but now human skin looks soft and has slight bluish tint we can also see that bo peep is porcelain as you can tell from the long winded phrasing common in the merchandising disney and pixar toy story this is pixar coming out party to celebrate they appended their first project hilarious short about two desklamps and rubber ball to the beginning of the movie they made the short in 1986 which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then on the downside toy story follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off bit stale and some sections tend to drag overall though had great time and found story to be worthy successor to the first toy story bottom line this one really is fun for the whole family

it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival palme or $100 million plus box office gross and an oscar nomination all for his sophomore outing pulp fiction since then the talented film maker has been virtually invisible surfacing briefly as co director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire fest from dusk till dawn in between he has moonlighted as an actor with several decidedly unmemorable performances now with much fanfare and anticipation tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort jackie brown and while this motion picture adapted from elmore leonard novel rum punch offers solid entertainment those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed for the most part jackie brown is pretty ordinary crime movie the story which starts out slowly develops into twisty affair with double crosses and triple crosses and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks witty dialogue unexpected gunfire 70s pop tunes and close ups of womens bare feet yet for all of that the production is something of letdown the sheer in your face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent the mostly straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn match up favorably to the non linear style of tarantino previous efforts an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives and there aren nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around there samuel jackson monologue about guns jackson chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in car trunk and jackson robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson travolta material from pulp fiction but that about it jackie brown lone innovation is its presentation of crucial sequence from three different perspectives this isn exactly an original technique it has been done numerous times before most famously in akira kurosawa rashomon and most recently in edward zwick courage under fire however while in those two movies and others there was legitimate plot reason for the multiple points of view tarantino sole purpose for using it appears to be because it unconventional had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages nothing would have been lost as result this aspect of the film is little more than curiosity for the second picture in row tarantino is attempting to revive the career of 70s icon this time around instead of john travolta it blaxploitation queen pam grier foxy brown has become jackie brown in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier career tarantino uses 70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre although grier never does any butt kicking grier is jackie brown flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states she working for gun dealer ordell robbie samuel jackson but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning despite pressure from ray nicolet michael keaton federal official no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie ordell arranges for bail bondsman max cherry robert forster tv banyon to post the necessary $10 000 then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal jackie passes ordell test however and soon the two of them are plotting way to smuggle $500 000 of ordell money into the united states without tipping off the feds soon just about everyone is after that money including jackie max ray ordell perpetually oversexed and drugged out girlfriend melanie bridget fonda and his right hand man louis robert de niro unsurprisingly the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel jackson but ordell isn nearly as invigorating or compelling character as jules from pulp fiction in addition to looking fantastic pam grier is also quite good although hers is not an oscar caliber performance although she might get nomination robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough guys who rarely smile roles bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons to look sexy in bikini to provide little twisted comedy and to satisfy tarantino foot fetish robert de niro is criminally underused in part that could have been played equally well by any grungy looking middle aged actor the film which clocks in at several minutes over the two and half hour mark is probably too long for the material but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout although the payoff is letdown tarantino keeps things moving along nicely with heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction but on the whole this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself when it comes to recent caper films like the grifters and bound jackie brown is second tier effort it an entertaining diversion but not masterpiece and certainly not an oscar contender
pitch siyah is sheep in wolf clothing it is full of darkness danger and violence and if you buy into the marketing hype an unsettling and scary film going experience don be fooled pitch siyah is morality play masquerading as scare fest it starts off with blistering intensity cargo spaceship crash lands on planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of three suns among the survivors is fry mitchell the ship pilot who spends the film wrestling with the fact that she tried to jettison the other passengers in her effort to land the craft safely there is imam david an islamic leader whose faith in his god is tested repeatedly throughout the film there is law enforcement officer in the form of johns hauser who attacks every situation with square jawed authoritarian zeal and there is riddick diesel menacing muscle bound convicted murderer who being brought back to justice by johns the group quickly sizes up the situation and each other confident in their assessment of matters plan is set in motion to escape their hellish environment those plans are shredded by the appearance of one of the planet wildlife predatory sometimes winged species that enjoys the taste of blood and flesh fortunately the creatures are light sensitive and are forced to live in networks of catacombs under the planet surface unfortunately the group has managed to land on the planet moments before an eclipse is about to occur taking away their one protection from the monsters the group savior comes in the form of johns whose decisive leadership looks to deliver them from purgatory or does it pitch siyah deviates from the standard sci fi fare by avoiding some of the stock escape the boogieman conflicts the genre typically serves up just as the planet gave false facade of lifelessness first appearances given by the survivors proves to be just as false the excitement of the film comes not from the danger posed by the creatures but rather from watching the shifting allegiances and emotional growth of the characters as the planet serves as deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth recurrent theme runs throughout the movie of faith whether it be religious or in person and how that powers their motivations found it telling that an accidental death occurs early on due to the misperception of self professed atheist conversely imam constantly contributes any good fortune to allah one by one his perceived heaven sent blessings are taken away and crushed imam is forced to reassess his faith another character expresses belief in god along with life long hate yet another character makes decision that echoes the sentiments of christ about selflessness and has lasting repercussions for several of group it is fascinating character study hiding under the guise of scare flick special mention should be made of vin diesel who intriguingly conveys feral menace combined with truly mesmerizing presence his character could have easily slipped into parody of the baddass killing machine but twohy and diesel add surprising depth to riddick they can be excused for the two or three shwarzenegger like catch phrases that growl their way out of diesel mouth the movie has its flaws that can be nitpicked the creatures do look derivative of the ones in alien the dialogue isn the freshest at times reminiscent of bad comic book yes the appearance of riddick vision skills are more than little timely considering the situation these trappings are on the periphery of the story twohy is really trying to tell twohy may have lured you in under the pretense of scaring you with film fabricated boogieman but he shows the real boogieman to be the prejudices and beliefs we use to direct decisions in our lives
assume nothing the phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990 as first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be the phrase especially goes for oscar novak an architect who is the main focus of three to tango delightful funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself novak matthew perry shy clumsy chicago based architect along with openly gay partner peter steinberg oliver platt fights for projects day in and day out one of these is the job of restoring popular building for charles newman dylan mcdermott rich well known businessman charles immediately takes liking to oscar as he enjoys his personality and sense of humor seeing oscar as someone he could trust charles asks him to watch his girlfriend an unpredictable adventurous girl named amy post neve campbell who makes living by blowing glass charles wants to know who she talks to what she does and where she goes the point to make sure she not seeing someone else of course oscar gladly takes the job and meets amy at an art show of hers and sparks fly between the two from the get go oscar feels he has found the one meant for him and he is content with the idea of being with amy well another popular phrase of the 90 is all good things must come to an end and this stays true for oscar as well charles walks in on amy and oscar having drink one night as oscar and amy have become great friends but he doesn seem to mind why is this he thinks oscar is gay he not afraid to share this with him either oscar stands in shock after the words swear if you weren gay oscar have to kill you are muttered flamboyantly from charles mouth the word spreads instantly through town will oscar come out of his supposed gayness or will he tell everyone that he isn one would immediately think he would deny the fact but numerous occurrences come to oscar which result in the fact that if he denies the fact he could lose his job with charles matthew perry doesn escape his character as chandler on the already classic comedy friends as both oscar novak and chandler are clueless shy and sensitive nonetheless perry is hilarious here and shows that he can handle drama as obviously his character suffers quite bit here it wonderful to see neve campbell outside of horror movie she was the star of scream and and the upcoming scream as she handles comedy superbly here her voice smile and personality are more than perfect for romantic comedies stay with this genre neve neve is delightful as her conflicted character who feels love for oscar but knows based on rumors that he is gay as usual campbell is likable as her likable character unlike the other two leads here dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue and is never convincing when his character his present mcdermott sets dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting stick to the drama the practice dylan the major weak spot in three to tango is the direction of damon santostefano no originality or technique is used whatsoever three to tango is lucky that the script is so edgy and that perry and campbell are wonderful in comedy or else the film would have been disaster as it is just plain boring to look at three to tango is film done many times before as the plot is suspiciously close to 1998 the object of my affection but the plot has never been completed so well three to tango script written by rodney patrick vaccaro and aline brosh mckenna is fun fast and funny delivering not only original hilarious gay jokes not your run of the mill material but certain snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling unlike last summer south park bigger longer and uncut and 1997 in out three to tango is comedy in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar the script is wise to take this route as gays can don think so anyway be offended by this light playful comedy to prove this gay couple was in the audience who were laughing constantly three to tango climax is hilarious clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most romantic mistaken identity comedies three to tango is gem the bottom line three to tango is light sharp snappy romantic comedy with superb ending and great stars one of the better romantic comedies of 1999
clint eastwood in his ripe old age is cashing one talent in for another midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwood directed film clint isn even in and it damn good adapted from best selling john berendt novel based on true events this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head and that just the mayor as director and producer eastwood contributes self indulgent but very competent 150 minutes neatly balancing drama suspense and humor like all great movies midnight in the garden has lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves and not from some contrived juvenile intrusion the acting from big time stars john cusack and kevin spacey is as good as you expect but it the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm cusack plays free lance reporter sent to savannah to write fluff story for town country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spacey parties lots of food beverages and gunplay yes an employee of spacey has huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead it seems like simple matter of self defense the guy threatened spacey shot at him missed then spacey took him out but being movie there much more to it than that and cusack decides to stay in town and write book about the murder book which will eventually become movie he will star in the weird circle of entertainment this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in there the requisite sexy woman alison nepotist daughter eastwood the strange piano player the voodoo woman and the transvestite miss chablis deserves paragraph of his her own as the stealer of every scene she appears in what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony chablis playing herself is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul but never seems exploited as the movie comic relief or out of place in basically serious movie there are also fair share of courtroom scenes which these days almost never seem welcome in movie but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating certainly the characterizations of the judge and spacey lawyer both help immensely as does having the fly guy as the jury foreman it here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spacey homosexuality yes spacey had sexual relationship with the dead man before he shot him of course midnight in the garden of good and evil isn classic but it is one of the better celebrity directed true story best seller adaptations out there likewise no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations but the performances are all great in fact almost recommend that the academy add best supporting transvestite category serving america for more than 25th of century
so many students strive to get into schools such as harvard of princeton but they just don get the good grades so many students would do anything to reach their goal of getting into this schools legend has it that if your roommate commits suicide the remaining roommates will get an automatic chris michael vartan and tim matthew lillard are two guys who really want the to get into harvard how far will they go to get their chris and tim are also roommates with rand played by randall batinkoff the two scheme to murder rand make it look like suicide so they can supposedly get their they have heard this rumor many places and they are willing to take the chance to find out rand is very very mean person he treats his girlfriend natalie played by tamara craig thomas like she doesn matter at all she is very afraid of him and she especially afraid now that she must tell him she is pregnant she does tell him and he becomes enraged that night would be the last night of rand life tim and chris give rand bottle of rat poison making him think that it is beer rand drinks down the poison and then dies now tim pushes him off of mountain with suicide note near the site to make it look like he killed himself it does not take long until the suicide note is found but the body isn found the police question chris and tim about rand to try and find any information feeling extreme guilt chris is having very hard time especially with his girlfriend emma played by keri russell she wants to know more but he will not even speak with her will he give in will tim turn chris in will chris turn tim in will they turn themselves in all of these questions were running through my mind while watching this slick suspense film the events in the curve are very surprising original and fun the plot sounds much like dead man on campus but that is not the deal with this film this film is very serious one with not many laughs there are many twists and turns that make this film different from most films the ending in particular is completely unpredictable and satisfying it is terrific suspenseful ending that could never predict would happen hands down to dan rosen who wrote this wild ride the sound really stood out in the film it is quite eerie and it really adds to the feel of the film the way the movie is filmed is also great all of the technical aspects as well as the acting and directing aspects are very well done the performances in the curve are very good matthew lillard gets to play another creepy role just like in 1996 scream a+ he is very strange in this film as well like him in this sort of role rather than the roles he has been playing in comedies such as senseless and she all that michael vartan is fantastic as chris who has extremely mixed emotions about the entire murder and the michael vartan was also superb in never been kissed where he co starred with drew barrymore as teacher who fell in love with his student keri russell also gives great performance she should be good actress in the horror department of the film tamara craig thomas is also realistic especially coping with the death of her boyfriend some very strong supporting performances came from smaller roles such as bo dietl and anthony griffith who play two detectives investigating the case the bottom line might just have to curve that into an note the curve premiered at the sundance film festival in early 1998 it was decided the film would not be released widely it is now available at blockbuster video only and for rent only see you at the video store
mike myers you certainly did throw us frickin bone here in what you call the biggest austin powers adventure yet austin powers the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers international man of mystery many are skeptical about sequels saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original but austin powers tswsm goes beyond the first film austin powers the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles he reprises his role as the title character austin powers the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967 and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr evil also played by mike myers from destroying the earth tswsm leaves off where the original stopped with dr evil frisch big boy space capsule floating through space dr evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967 in which he plans to steal austin powers mojo what keeps austin going with spy talents upon his return to his secret lair which is now starbucks coffee shop dr evil learns that his evil henchman which includes the returning robert wagner as number and mindy sterling as frau have created size clone of dr evil which is later named mini me the evil mini me replaces scott evil played by seth green as dr evil son in the madman mind because dr evil thinks of scott to be only quasi evil dr evil has always wanted son that is evil just like him and now he has one dr evil tells mini me you complete me in loving manner dr evil loving wow mike myers third role is as fat bastard scottish henchman of dr evil who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers frozen body austin powers learns of dr evil trip back into the 60s and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets hold of it once arriving in the year 1967 austin travels to his pad his smashing home dance club where he meets felicity shagwell played by heather graham cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr evil as the film progresses hilarious one liners are thrown at us mainly by dr evil for example don go there girlfriend to the president of the united states many witty gags take place note the entire tent scene and just plain funny scenes which are so stupid they re funny come dozen per fifteen minutes take for example scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is the way austin powers tswsm uses its humor is clever throwing hilarious scene at you followed by five minutes of one liners followed by another outrageous scene so you never stop laughing there was honestly not one moment in austin powers tswsm where wasn laughing the last film that laughed so hard in was well austin powers it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it the film even makes fun of itself in line something along the lines of it funny how england and southern california look nothing alike tswsm was filmed in southern california but was supposed to take place in england can tell you one thing he is having lot of fun with this enormously popular character which is all over television newspapers magazines and the movie theaters believe that dr evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did dr evil provided more laughs more memorable moments and more interesting dialogue than austin did this time around who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away but from screenplay writer mike myers not fat bastard also making great addition to the series is mini me who is played by verne troyer even though the midget actor is 30 years old he is adorable by dr evil side constantly the first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality such as lack of character development barely any detailed plot characteristics and barely any good acting but austin powers tswsm actually shows some quality behind the frequent humor mike myers with his three roles acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor disguising himself completely in one of the roles fat bastard all three characters are different and mike myers does do good job handling each one of them heather graham made great addition with her talent to tswsm and does much better job than elizabeth hurley did who gave very flat performance in the original speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion speaking of hurley she can be seen in tswsm for few brief moments hopefully graham tags along for future austin powers adventures the bottom line groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing
well this is not mission difficult mr hunt it mission impossible difficult should be walk in the park for you agent swanbeck sir anthony hopkins the series new agent phelps takes ethan hunt tom cruise down notch russian scientist rade serbedzija has created new virus and its antidote called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection rogue imf agent sean ambrose dougray scott wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company he knows it will soon be worth its weight in altin thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause posing as ethan hunt ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do the real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoff hall thandie newton to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods ethan and nyah fall quickly in love but ethan soon finds himself in real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was former lover of ambrose reluctantly he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team ethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah although the first mission impossible film was moderate box office success audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasn much action although being fan of the series both old and new thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps bad guy that problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry robert towne and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo the end result is one of the most entertaining yet simple action films made in long while unfortunately the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow dwelling mainly on ethan and nyah quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in james bond film than with the less glamorous mission impossible tv series ethan conflict is compelling one but it seems very rushed and comes about because of near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes john woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place featuring great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed close ups the surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately detriment to the film thankfully though at the point ambrose discovers nyah deception mission impossible ii becomes very entertaining and action packed robert towne screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during sequence where ethan must break into high rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus after that the action scenes just begin to build in intensity as is the case with many of woo previous high octane films the final half hour is an all out assault of action good deal of which is ruined by the trailer unfortunately as far as summer entertainment goes mission impossible ii is serviceable fare anyone looking for hardcore action won be disappointed except for during the first half of the film perhaps even if you weren fan of the first film this entry deserves some checking out [pg 13]
usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock others will mention meg ryan but for me it not even close janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now and it good thing she starring in the matchmaker because without her presence the movie would be bland unfunny and dull garofalo stars as marcy tizard top aide to boston senator john mcglory who is suffering in the polls in an attempt to capture the irish vote he sends marcy on mission to small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglory that never moved to america unfortunately for marcy her visit coincides with the town annual matchmaking festival things get off to rocky start for marcy though she has no hotel reservations for no rational reason and the tiny confined room tired old cliche she has to stay in has visitor in her bathtub his name is sean and marcy finds him repugnant at first so you can obviously tell where this is headed the movie runs into few roadblocks for instance the story is very thin none of the characters except the old local matchmaker are nearly as interesting as garofalo some of the characters like the political aide played by denis leary have wandered in from completely different movie think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery and several close ups of garofalo winning smile the strange thing is that it works garofalo charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories and it carries this one
for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and high art the son room is an inventive subtle alternative written by directed and starring nanni moretti it takes us through the slow complicated path of bereavement slow is the best description for the film at first it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be normal happy family father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities they laugh spend free time together and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with sigh and soft pat on the shoulder you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome but suddenly the son is found to be dead after diving accident the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it but can also be trying on the attention span though the film drags and even repeats itself this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production it doesn come across as vanity piece one might wish he hadn picked the profession of analyst for the father giovanni which he stars as if only because this makes his character reactions so predictable what saves it is well written script with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of close relative or that remind depressed person of loss you start to take notice of the cracked dishes ignored when familial bliss was in full swing you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block and not necessarily huge events like graduation even better are the role reversals that take place within the household while giovanni and paola laura morante do check up on their daughter irene jasmine trinca there is sense of being on autopilot not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more she ll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms frequently crossing boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic unexpected change respectfully gender issues never enter the picture self propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at party with friends there is never sense that he or she is more stoic or more correct in the search to restore sense of balance to their lives most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama speeches and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing in contrast the son room captures more realistic depiction of the effects of death on family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning denial depression anger bargaining acceptance through each of its main characters it not the most engaging 100 minutes but it is certainly easy to relate to
so here is the second of 1999 remakes of classic horror movies the first was the dumb pathetic but ok remake of the classic the haunting now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill the classic which starred vincent price as man who pays group of people 100 000 to stay in his house if they survive the night they get the money if not well you get the jurisdiction having not yet seen the film dvd on its way wasn sure if would really like the remake but sure enough it comes through and has great storyline to fall back on geoffrey rush in fantastic role with an incredible performance is steven price the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people his wife evelyn price is throwing party with her friends steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list somehow someone or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party eddie taye diggs an ex baseball player sarah ali carter an ex assistant who can re wire anything melissa brigette wilson talk show host in sorts dr blackburn peter ghallager and watson chris kattan smart mouthed humorist in ways what he is gonna do is pay these five people 000 000 dollars if they can survive through the night if they can they get the money if not well they don the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr there forcing him to lock the place up because if he died so did they everyone who was in there burned to death now it is steven price home and he is throwing this party for these five people what starts out as seemingly normal night turns into horrifying blood splattering night the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed one by one the people start to disappear conspiracies start to turn up and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all the people find rooms which once held mental patients rooms which once had people dying rooms which may still contain these people now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house and they must survive each other with terrorfying results since officially haven seen the original can say which is better can say however liked this movie geoffrey rush gives one in million performance as the rich steven price and does great job doing vincent price role famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives fantastic performance here as does taye diggs chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains lot of comical lines peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy and even sometimes downright scary found even the opening credits to me little ominous one thing knew not to expect was haunting type movie with special effects galore even though it had fantastic gore and special effects the movie has only 19 million dollar budget which doesn show all the way through but you can tell the movie was written well and it only major flaw is the under developed characters and plot holes that we are left with the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it must say house on haunted hill was surprise was expecting another haunting with special effects no scares and dumb ending instead found good halloween movie with gore scares and great acting house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can take seriously though it is well made movie with good storyline it still has some flaws but besides that the movie is fun smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this can be made all the time

one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made se7en is just few steps away from brilliance however those few steps away are only few steps from level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss the film received mixed reviews upon release but there an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing but the script and the ultimate pay off are excellent the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable this piece of work is 100% intensity it uncomfortable to watch yet compelling want not to look yet cannot turn away the story creeps along slowly and deliberately crafted by visionary director david fincher he has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions but not giving away too much too soon this is the guy who directed the ominous alien se7en is even more ominous because the threat is real it human and while the script takes some artistic licence the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic that is if human being could be so intelligent patient wealthy and disillusioned after the most bizarre opening credits ve ever seen refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment the initial character development takes place morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society brad pitt co stars as detective david mills the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys these two fine actors give the film its human qualities along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow who plays tracy mills wife however none of them stands out above the material no disrespect intended but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same an ironic note is that somerset has only week or that seven days left on the force to train his young protege the title of the picture also refers to the deadly sins as chronicled by john milton in paradise lost gluttony greed sloth lust pride envy wrath incidentally wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found it the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking but won give that away as said this has great ending and no one should spoil it anyway the brilliant killer sets out to make statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the sinners suffer for it the two partners stumble over the corpse of grotesquely obese man they learn that he was murdered forced to eat himself to death the killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and of course somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way if they didn it would be one short movie the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story we see lot of blood but it not especially violent the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown like most of the violence in pulp fiction se7en is gory graphic and disturbing but all the gore is post death still if you tend to get queasy don eat food during this film kevin spacey plays john doe the avenging angel who claims that he the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings like many crazy men he has some fine ideas but some sick ways of expressing himself spacey doesn appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn receive billing in the opening credits however it his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not this character is so well written that it hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone no serial killer has ever been so creative se7en is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it often little too depressing what it lacks in those areas it makes up for with believable dialogue top notch screenwriting unexpected twists and realistic characters the technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive fincher uses lighting music and editing quite well but his story is always the thrust of the film fortunately we don find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits which are run backwards up the screen it better to imagine what paths they will follow this is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget it got sinister message and john doe is right about one thing the evils of the world aren going to cure themselves se7en raises some tough

scream like its predecessor is genre crossing film it is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mystery the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time scream was also known for its self referential tone many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven again scream follows suit with characters saying such things as sequels suck and the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels scream story is very similar to it predecessor sidney neve campbell having survived the killing spree in scream is now in college gale weathers courteney cox has written book about the murders and that book is now being released as feature film called stab which for all practical purposes is the real world movie scream at the premiere of stab two students from sidney college are stabbed to death and new story begins the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer they want to know all about the links between stab sidney and the recent murders the most complex self reference saw this should be an olympic event was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at press conference the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press the audience was watching the whole filmed scene whew the movie is packed with layers and self references that make it pleasure to watch even better would be to watch double feature of scream and scream that not to say that these references necessarily make scream deep or even good movie the just add to the fun of watching it recommend it for other reasons as well what liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible it is person in mask and robe his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies you have less grounds to say it just movie the whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself gale weathers and deputy dewey david arquette also from the original track down killer they are likeable but not outstanding but in combination with the horror aspect the whodunit is perfect counterpoint it was exactly year ago today that wrote the review for scream the internet movie database says that scream is in the works so wonder if ll be doing the same thing on january 1999 if craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high ll be happy to mark my calendar
when first saw the previews for ron howard latest film my expectations were discouragingly low show about nothing sounds like seinfeld guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours day sounds like the truman show what is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants another puts one out about bugs which is why was pleasantly surprised by edtv which turns out to be fresh insightful and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity the writing by howard longtime collaborators lowell ganz and babaloo mandel is right on the money and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter fresh focus in the hands of less experienced director edtv could easily have had all the flavor of yesterday meatloaf with their true tv cable ratings being threatened by the gardening channel apparently people would rather watch soil the northwest broadcasting company is looking for novel concept to attract viewers program director cynthia topping ellen degeneres comes up with the idea of putting nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking and sleeping moment the hook is to find regular guy someone normal that people can relate to while scouting possible candidates cynthia camera crew discover ed pekurny and his pig brother ray woody harrelson in bar where ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame but on watching the videotape the show producers are more taken with ed than with ray he cute he says all the wrong things and he 100% usda hick cynthia boss played by rob reiner gives the show week to deliver the goods and it tough going in the early stages the most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth action shot wags one of the production assistants when couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster you get the idea but soon enough things nielsen boosting kinds of things start to happen to this unassuming san francisco video store clerk and the true tv cameras are right there to document it ed privacy is no longer his own his newfound fame starts having negative impact on his family life and what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media who should ed go out with you can be sure the pollsters have list not only is the film exceedingly well cast but its performers are consistently excellent matthew mcconaughey provides the face the body language and the lovable texan accent to fill the shoes of america latest phenomenon he and harrelson look like they really could be brothers sally kirkland is noteworthy in difficult role as ed mother and martin landau is one of the film highlights as al ed ailing stepfather jenna elfman from tv dharma and greg proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkland and landau although those alpine eyebrows of hers get little distracting even degeneres and reiner are better than you expect in 1979 writer director comedian albert brooks made zany little film called real life in which small time opportunist makes real time documentary about typical american family the scenes of ed family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like big budget variant on that film paralleling its wickedly inventive humor as with most films by albert brooks real life was funny but absurd the funniest and scariest thing about edtv is that it is absolutely believable

the premise is simple if not bizarre mad scientist trace beaulieu as dr clayton forrester launches an average joe michael nelson as mike nelson into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made why it torturous it maniacal and it just plain fun based on the cult favorite cable television series mystery science theater 3000 the movie isn torturous but as for being maniacal and just plain fun it foots the bill quite nicely mike nelson on dog bone shaped spacecraft spends his days as any young man would dream indulging in sarcasm and horseplay and seeing quite few movies the catch is these movies aren the movies he chooses but retched examples of film making chosen specifically by dr forrester in an attempt to break mike will to live dr forrester is convinced that one too many movies is all it will take to ruin man but with couple of wise cracking puppet buddies tom servo voiced by kevin murphy and crow robot voiced by beaulieu the torture becomes somewhat of honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known even if by very few of us to man we watch as the silhouettes of mike tom and crow sit in darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them in this case it the 1954 sci fi film this island earth we basically watch as our three leads watch only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary the plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant but for the sake of those who might want to know ll explain this one this island earth is the tale of two scientists man and woman who wind up aboard spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth together the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet to make mst3k work the film within the film naturally has to be as horrible as possible and although the tv series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth it bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty mst3k which doesn actually contain the complete this island earth is short 73 minutes but this is step very wisely taken as funny as some of their observations are it can only go so long occasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously although it takes second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for moment it better than overkilling the whole concept post haste mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly but if you don know what you re in for it could be jarring disappointment although thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars it is movie to be seen on home video late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway and with large saracastic crowd new year at midnight for example which is when saw it warning although mst3k has more to its end credits than most the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun they are actually more annoying than most the name slandering and asinine one liners were extremely unfunny and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight it put heavy damper on the overall experience most people will likely stay to see what the smart alec have to say but for me it almost ruined an otherwise good film
cinematically speaking gordon parks original 1971 _shaft_ is not great film bit slow at times and more than little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman siyah private dick that sex machine to all the chicks to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking yet nearly 30 years after its original release and long after the genre it spawned blaxploitation died with that decade the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness the reason for this is the same one that explains the film connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african american audience the title character of john shaft while the fact that the strong smart virile and superbly suave shaft is siyah is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance his broad based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race he is comfortable confident and proud about who he is and anyone who had problem with that could simply kiss his ass this fact also explains why john singleton y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is much like the film that started the franchise this _shaft_ plot doesn score points in the originality department but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers contrary to what has been reported over the past few months this _shaft_ is not remake of the original film but more of sequel spinoff the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels 1972 _shaft s_big_score and 1973 _shaft_in_africa_ richard roundtree once again plays john shaft who still runs private investigation firm in new york city however the focus of the film lies on his same named nephew samuel jackson who as the film begins is cop whose take no crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors when privileged young man named walter wade jr christian bale accused of brutal racially motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as but that easier said than done for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez jeffrey wright dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri toni collette the only eyewitness to his crime peoples or rather wright is also the big obstacle in jackson way toward commanding this film peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time and wright is insanely funny during these stages however he isn so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish and peoples eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo who bowed out before filming it no easy task to steal film from the jackson who is his usual captivating charismatic self here but that exactly what wright does and makes it seem effortless then again with such talented ensemble surrounding him it is not too surprising that jackson impressive star turn doesn quite tower over the rest he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co stars bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ so it only follows that his performance as similar less exaggerated character would be spot on collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened conflicted diane busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft sidekick rasaan registering not as strongly but through no fault of their own are vanessa williams as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez and dismayingly underused roundtree they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price singleton and shane salerno jackson also has little to do in sense some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside his shaft doesn even have one sex scene that singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he not really an action director this is not to say that he does bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases they move well as does the film as whole and are reasonably exciting it just that there nothing terribly inventive about them these set pieces are functional in the way the script is they work well enough but they re unsurprising and conventional but if there anything that _shaft_ movie does well it make the familiar look cool and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive from the slick title sequence scored of course to isaac hayes ever infectious oscar winning theme song which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film on the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado even common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced it feels necessary style doesn exactly make for great film but when it comes to _shaft_ that of little consequence what matters above all else is having good time and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha shut your mouth
now that boogie nights has made disco respectable again well fashionable at least we shouldn be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era the latest art house interpretation is whit stillman the last days of disco stillman who made metropolitan and barcelona using some of the same actors uses disco final hours to highlight what is another conversation heavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director the young upwardly mobile professional don call them yuppies men and women of the last days of disco frequent prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass pounding rhythms of earth wind and fire amy grant and andrea true connection here they talk and talk and talk intellectualizing about such things as dating success and being liked accepted and admired if talk is cheap the last days of disco must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot what makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie harvard educated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit perception and style including at one point riotously inventive deconstruction of the lady and the tramp na ve alice chlo sevigny and sophisticated charlotte kate beckinsale are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for new york publishing house charlotte is confident and outspoken perhaps little too outspoken alice is shy and introverted like kindergarten teacher the two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot looking good and looking for excitement and that ms beckinsale sure looks good on dancefloor here they meet or re meet variety of eligible men many of whom they knew in college des played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman is one of the club managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back des has reached crisis point in his life he just found out last wednesday in fact that he gay whether it true or not it makes for convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend jennifer beals in small but soul baring turn charlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth jimmy mackenzie astin is the advertising exec who by the end of the picture winds up heading for new job opportunity in spain visions of barcelona josh matt keeslar is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say just once book this clown and robert sean leonard plays another one of alice revolving suitors the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity any film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book in fact the entire ensemble is appealing in that well spoken stillman way while the eschewing of ferocious pairing is favored topic of conversation in the film the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love lust and trouble with each other in an emotional merry go round that cleverly develops its characters through the preferred dynamics of social group interaction more mature than stillman previous two films the last days of disco is as consistently droll as it is stimulating it movie you should definitely get on down to
richard gere can be commanding actor but he not always in great films everything comes together here gere is big time chicago defense attorney who takes on seemingly unwinable case in hopes of even more publicity it doesn go exactly as he expects gere client aaron edward norton is shy stuttering tennessee boy who is accused of brutally murdering and mutilating catholic archbishop the evidence is stacked against him he was caught running from the scene covered in the bishop blood his bloody footprints are all over the murder scene he has relationship with the priest gere talks to the boy believes that he is actually innocent and sets about finding the real killer despite the lawyer proclamations that he doesn care about the guilt of his clients and that the real thrill is gambling with people lives he becomes involved with aaron and is determined to free him lots of complications and twists the prosecuting attorney is gere former co worker and lover they both work each other motives to their legal advantages and it gets messy her boss had major economic dealings with the archbishop that went sour and seems to have crime connections aaron gets weirder and weirder as the trial goes on gere case is falling apart and he is faced with about dozen ethical dilemmas gere is exceptional as the well dressed reserved counselor but just once wanted to see him kick back and come out of his suit persona even when he loses it you don see very far inside norton aaron is convincing he comes across as the backwoods kid misplaced in the big city the supporting cast does fine job of holding together the story as with most of the effective courtroom dramas the cinematography is crisp and rich the story will keep you on the edge of your seat nothing is what it seems
