you ve got mail works alot better than it deserves to in order to make the film success all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it body it basically complete re shoot of the shop around the corner only adding few modern twists essentially it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking it overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy not to mention very manipulative but oh how enjoyable that manipulation is but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does because absolutely hated the previous ryan hanks teaming sleepless in seattle it couldn have been the directing because both films were helmed by the same woman haven quite yet figured out what liked so much about you ve got mail but then again is that really important if you like something so much why even question it again the storyline is as cliched as they come tom hanks plays joe fox the insanely likeable owner of discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley the even more insanely likeable proprietor of family run children book shop called in nice homage the shop around the corner fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business little do they know they are already in love with each other over the internet only neither party knows the other person true identity the rest of the story isn important because all it does is serve as mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen sure there are some mildly interesting subplots but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship all of this of course leads up to the predictable climax but as foreseeable as the ending is it so damn cute and well done that doubt any movie in the entire year contains scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love was filled with such for lack of better word happiness that for the first time all year actually left the theater smiling
jaws is rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you single image on screen the movie opens with blackness and only distant alien like underwater sounds then it comes the first ominous bars of composer john williams now infamous score dah dum from there director steven spielberg wastes no time taking us into the water on midnight swim with beautiful girl that turns deadly right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean and once jaws has attacked it never relinquishes its grip perhaps what is most outstanding about jaws is how spielberg builds the movie he works it like theatrical production with first act and second act unlike so many modern filmmakers he has great deal of restraint and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act until then he merely suggests its presence with creepy subjective underwater shots and williams music he building the tension bit by bit so when it comes time for the climax the shark arrival is truly terrifying he doesn let us get bored with the imagery the first act opens with police chief martin brody roy scheider new york cop who has taken an easy peaceful job running the police station on amity island fictitious new england resort town where there hasn been murder or gun fired in 25 years the island is shaken up by several vicious great beyaz shark attacks right before the fourth of july and the mayor larry vaughn murray hamilton doesn want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money brody is joined by matt hooper richard dreyfuss young ambitious shark expert from the marine institute hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark it perfect engine an eating machine make it that much more terrifying when vaughn finally relents hooper and brody join crusty old shark killer named quint robert shaw on his decrepit boat the orca to search for the shark the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark and inevitably are hunted by it jaws is thriller with keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing tension and horror it is like ten movies all rolled into one and it no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by star wars even today fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock psycho and it never seems to age although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences including several mechanical sharks obsolete none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing characterization sharp editing and creative photography instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects scheider dreyfuss and shaw were known actors at the time jaws was made but none of them had the draw of robert redford or paul newman nevertheless this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark scheider hits just the right notes as sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what right and going against the entire town it your first summer here you know mayor vaughn warns him dreyfuss who had previously been seen in american graffiti 1973 and the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz 1974 gives surprisingly mature complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers however most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie captain ahab performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards bordering of parody shaw plays quint as grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism he slightly deranged and shaw performance is almost caricature however there is one scene late in the film when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the indianapolis navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese his tale of floating in the water for more than week with over 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair raising than anything spielberg put on screen shaw delivers the story in one long take and it is the best acting in the film of course we can leave out the shark itself with its siyah eyes endless rows of teeth and insatiable urge to eat it is basically the epitome of all mankind fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature shark is such perfect nemesis it is real having survived sinch the dinosaurs great whites do exist they can be as large as the shark in jaws and they are threat every one of spielberg subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark bunch of writihing dangling completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into the shark in jaws was actually combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks all nicknamed bruce by the crew built to be shot from different angles many have forgotten but jaws was sort of precursor to waterworld 1995 movie who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about bomb but as we can see now spielberg overcame all the obstacles and delivered one of the finest primal scare thrillers ever to come out of hollywood
after watching rat race last week noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that when not laughing aloud had held grin for virtually all of the film 112 minutes saturday night attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if didn enjoy it as much the second time as the first rat race is great goofy delight dandy mix of energetic performances inspired sight gags and flat out silliness hands down this is the most fun film of the summer the movie begins with zippy retro style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of 60s slapstick comedy featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky jerky bodies bounding around the screen then comes the setup donald sinclair john cleese the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients to that end he places half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines gathering together the lucky token holders he explains today you have chance to play game where the odds of winning are one in six the competition is simple each contestant gets key that opens locker in silver city containing $2 million in cash there is transmitter in every key so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead the race has no rules whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes let use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers decked out in flashy trashy clothing and sporting big hair vera baker whoopi goldberg is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as baby she finds that grown up merrill lanai chapman is erudite conservative and more than little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life thrown together it becomes clear that both women share fierce competitive nature owen templeton cuba gooding jr is currently the most hated man in america an nfl referee he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing call in high profile game after escaping from vengeful cab driver owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to convention mr pollini rowan atkinson is cheerful odd little italian man on holiday in america he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times pollini hitches ride with zack wayne knight hyper tense ambulance driver carrying human heart across country for transplant operation randy pear jon lovitz promised his wife beverly kathy najimy and two kids fun filled vacation in las vegas fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race he claims that he must travel to silver city for job interview beverly insists the family stay together so they hop in the mini van and tear off into the desert brothers duane seth green and blaine vince vieluf cody are young crooked and stupid blaine has speech impediment due to his poorly self done tongue piercing and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal finally nick shaffer breckin meyer is no nonsense lawyer in training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet amy smart for the journey at first glance they seem blandly wholesome but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn dean cain and spies him swimming with another woman director jerry zucker airplane ghost leaps from racer to racer periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr grisham dave thomas his personality impaired right hand man continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers as with any zucker production few jokes fall flat but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps high points for me include bit involving kathy bates as roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from bizarre museum to an outdoor rally with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay off had been part of the filmmaking team would have ditched joke where key is dropped into baby clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of dozing society matron it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm inducing hint of child molestation also would have selected different band for concert sequence my god do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing all star but enough carping rat race is riot with terrific no holds barred performances from the diverse cast see it see it again and when the dvd comes out buy it because movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for
one can not observe star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy innocent fun sometimes the stories are compelling sometimes they re not but with the exception of the first film in the series which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ve never been bored by any of the enterprise numerous missions star trek insurrection is no exception the film has gotten some negative reviews friend of mine actually thinks it the worst in the series but not really sure why it an exciting often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film some say it bit too light and more of long episode than film others say the special effects are cheesy and that it boring simply enjoyed the film insurrection which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast introduces us to race of people called the ba ku the ba ku are very old most of them are about three hundred years old but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet of course these peaceful people can horde this fountain of youth all for themselves leave it up to their archenemies the son led by ru afo murray abraham to mess everything up the son who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable strike deal with the federation to move the ba ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying that when captain picard patrick stewart steps in he realizes that moving the ba ku would kill them it also helps that he falls in love with ba ku woman donna murphy so with his trusty crew picard defies the federation to keep the ba ku in their natural habitat when dealing with series with as much history as this it not entirely necessary to re introduce your characters with each episode this is why believe non fans have hard time getting into star trek in order to enjoy it one has to understand how to approach it insurrection however does surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters stewart is bold as always magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together jonathan frakes who also directed is funny as commander riker subplot with data brent spiner discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting and abraham makes perfect star trek villain overacting like crazy frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact insurrection is an exciting film with some really attractive special effects and lot of good action this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation and the result is very pleasing to the eye particularly in the climactic scenes in which the son employ giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba ku planet the special effects have clean impressively sharp look if have any complaint about the film it that it tries to take moral stance when it not very appropriate to do so don think it that big of deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba ku in order to save the lives of thousands better yet why couldn they have co existed insurrection feels little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience with it inherent camp factor the star trek series doesn seem well equipped to deal with issues like this prefer to just enjoy the spectacle
fully loaded entertainment review website coming in july >from ace ventura to truman burbank jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic yet sympathetic characters 1996 the cable guy was supposed to be his big breakthrough role from zany humor into darker more dramatic acting as most everyone knows the results were well less than stellar not only did the film not do so hot at the box office but it was also panned by critics as far as know gene siskel and are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it the first time saw the cable guy in theatres was in super critic mode and didn really like it however due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day ve had time to lean back relax and take in the film and to my surprise it grew on me the plot is rather simple broderick plays guy named steven who befriends his cable guy played by carrey then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship see steven been having some problems with his girlfriend robin leslie mann and he doesn think he has any more room in his life for new friend also some of the cable guy antics have been creeping him out carrey as the cable guy gives steven various aliases which later we find out are all tv characters larry tate chip douglas ricky ricardo etc he apparently lives in his cable van and while many critics didn enjoy this newer darker less manic performance from carrey thought it was interesting and rather well done for me its not the movie as whole that enjoyable but rather several individual scenes karaoke jam at steven apartment medieval fight at theme restaurant and bathroom beating la liar liar just to name few perhaps the fact that more of carrey humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny and if you really want to see something you ve got to hear his version of jefferson airplane somebody to love sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam the cable guy has its bad spots like most any movie didn particularly like steven girlfriend and felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend also the ending while having you fooled for moment is rather contrived and somewhat dissapointing still found the cable guy to be worthwhile venture if you re at the video store and can think of anything to rent suggest you try it out or if you have hbo just wait till it comes on you won have to wait long hell that what do every day
when bulworth ended allowed myself sigh of relief it is possible for me to enjoy political satire there have been several recent political films that didn do whole lot for me wag the dog for instance found to be an intelligent but heartless film while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness bulworth is far better film than these both in its execution and lasting impression it tremendously funny and intelligent picture but it also has an emotional center writer director star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character and in turn we like him and actually care about the story beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again he hasn slept in days nor has he eaten and almost instantaneously he goes insane he not stark raving mad not outright anyway but he definitely bonkers it the final weekend of his campaign and his assistant murphy oliver platt has written him speech to feed to group of siyah people in church in the ghetto bulworth begins the speech but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest you mean one lady asks the democratic party doesn care about the african american community well he shouts laughing isn that obvious the story is propelled by device in which bulworth puts out contract on his own life he muses later that it bad thing to make decisions when you re suicidal he keeps seeing man in sunglasses graham beckel whom he believes to be the hitman bulworth also meets nina halle berry with whom he becomes infatuated suddenly in the short span of this weekend bulworth no nonsense truth in politics methods become national sensation and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences beatty work on both sides of the camera is excellent his script and direction are both extremely sharp as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself here is man who reached his limit and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure like that the film doesn take clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich although the anti rich sentiments do get bit tiresome by the end of the film some of the segments are simply hilarious such as lengthy rap that he delivers at luncheon dedicated to him much of the film is completely absurd but that the fun part about it it an angry serious film at the core but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre what adds to this feeling is beatty portrayal of bulworth this is performance that deserves recognition on higher scale beatty is so much fun to watch here he always funny but he also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions beatty is so good that bulworth despite his shortcomings as human being is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning the supporting cast is vast and colorful berry is luminous as always and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles don cheadle has good role as drug dealer who uses gun toting toddlers to do his dirty work oliver platt is an actor who should be careful for someday fear he may induce heart attack with the intensity of his acting though he very funny to watch paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections is bulworth offensive suppose some may see it that way wasn offended by the film but then again hardly care about politics think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story the film isn perfect of course the ending didn quite work for me and the few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film bulworth is smart uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface
comedy rated pg runs about 40 starring john goodman kathy moriarty and bunch of teenagers directed by joe dante and written by charles hass summary lawrence woolsley john goodman brings his new horror film mant to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them quick and easy review really enjoyed matinee the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely unlike many comedies this film tries and succeeds in getting past the stage of doing anything for laugh the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story the performances of all the principals are right on the mark particularly john goodman as the schlock master so would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for light hearted yet interesting way to spend couple of hours longer more detailed review [beware of spoilers] the primary reason enjoyed this film was that while being comedy the film also had an intelligent story to tell too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that comedy need only make you laugh you watch the movie laugh lot leave the theatre and take nothing with you matinee is not like that left the picture thinking about what would do faced with the cuban missile crisis found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film but most importantly found myself caring about what would happen to the characters the comedy of the film centers around goodman his character and the film he brings to key west believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today he is highly expressive both physically and vocally felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink the other characters are often lost in scene with him due to his commanding nature however while the star goodman is actually not at the center of the film the movie is really the story of the four teenagers discovering who they are and what they want against background where at any minute it could all end thought the kids reaction were highly realistic they tried to block it out they tried to escape from the concerns of their world unfortunately it kept creeping back in particularly with the fear and the chaos of the time while the comedy centered on goodman and the drama on the teens there was great deal of overlap several aspects of the panic are shown in humorous light one example is scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in grocery store if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for comedy but it works here another reason like this film is that like science fiction movies one of my favorite films to go watch is plan from outer space note did not say it was one of my favorite movies but one of my favorite to see while mant never got made many films like it were and mant serves mostly as dante homage to the films he loves so again would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for good humorous story this isn gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent well thought out film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way enjoy
warning contains what the matrix is rated for sci fi violence starring keanu reeves laurence fishburne joe panteliano some may be disappointed with the matrix ll tell you was sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen now wait wait know most of you loved it and not saying didn like it what saying is the first half was extremely slow now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show don be fooled this movie has big story and big chunks of talky moments but will admit the special effects and the acting were above par deserving the rating above ok now to the story well this may take while ok first of all our world we live in now is not the real world actually we live inside computer generated world known as the matrix man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world he does so and finds out that he can do anything be anything he wants to be but he has to fight matrix skipping bad guy who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him laurence fishburne his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves but sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were yeah there were some in the first half but not enough the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was special effects laden movie now for the second half it is explosive and saves the movie some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking the sound the music and all the effects were effective and the last hour kept us entertained but with running time of hours and 20 minutes this movie is at least 40 minutes too long one would have wished for better matrix but do have to say did like it and was entertained
earth is harsh unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets indian and pakistani muslim hindu sikh parsee the story takes place in lahore which was indian before partition and pakistani afterward regardless of what its citizens might call themselves the action is seen through the eyes of lenny maaia sethna young parsee girl but it is really about her nanny shanta shanta has small circle of male admirers two of the men are suitors hasan rahul khanna hindu and dil navaz aamir khan muslim the others sikh hindu muslim are older some are married but all appreciate shanta who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das she also starred in deepa mehta previous film fire the first part of thematic trilogy which will conclude with water in an early scene the men are sitting in park talking with shanta and lenny political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears one of the men remarks jokingly that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along he is wrong the men make barbed little comments to each other spoken like jokes but with an undercurrent of fanaticism the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses it is easy to perceive in these squabbles the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter the group around shanta represents in sense united india and shanta herself the ideal motherland one which all love which inspires hindu muslim and sikh to live peacably together but the circle around shanta is sundered as is the state sikh is persecuted hides then flees another man is murdered the group of friends will not meet again the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction plate shattered on the floor stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child and most brutally when the tension escalates into violence man is held down tied between two cars and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles it is visceral and effective metaphor for country which is being destroyed just as painfully the crux of earth plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz his sisters are killed in brutal fashion by hindus because they are muslim dil navaz seeks solace from shanta and asks in desperation that she marry him but she loves hasan and tenderly refuses dil navaz offer the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality the muslim cause gives him motive to vent his anger and hate despite the things he later does it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things the conclusion the consequence of dil navaz transformation is rather abrupt the story earth tells does not end it just stops it is an appropriate finish giving us closure would have imparted at least on an aesthetic level sense of resolution of satisfaction but there was no resolution for india and pakistan they have been at war on small or large scale for decades since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of nation it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus there is no healing to be had no closure on any level despite the needless tacked on ending with voice over narration from lenny as an adult framing the story earth is in some ways an unexceptional movie it does not reinvent the wheel following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas but deepa mehta directon is assured and the issues she addresses run deep earth does for india what movies like zhang yimou to live and tian zhuangzhuang the mavi kite did for china they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history such films strike me as inherently valuable even when flawed they may be biased or inaccurate but they bear the weight of human hardship and this confers on them nobility and gravity which other more inventive films often lack it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries the events shown may have happened decades ago but they still touch nerve the issues tackled in earth have particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year in the near future india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other at the time of the tests had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen after seeing earth have much much better understanding
had been expecting more of this movie than the less than thrilling twister twister was good but had no real plot and no one to simpithize with but twister had amazing effects and was hoping so would volcano volcano starts with tommy lee jones at emo he worrys about small earthquake enough to leave his daughter at home with baby sitter there is one small quake then another quake then geologist points out to tommy that its takes geologic event to heat millions of gallons of water in 12 hours few hours later large amount of ash start to fall then it starts the volcanic eruption liked this movie but it was not as great as hoped was still good none the less it had excellent special effects the best view the helecopters flying over the streets of volcanos also there were interesting side stories that made the plot more interesting so it was good

james brooks one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news returns to the big screen with this entertaining if slightly flawed comedy nicholson plays melvin udall probably the most horrible person ever on the screen he racist homophobic and never has good word to say to anyone so nobody talks to him except waitress carol conelly sitcom star hunt who was last seen in twister 1996 naturally udall conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop kinnear who nicholson hates all hit it off in the end like good will hunting 1997 and titanic 1997 even though the outcome is completely obvious as good as it gets is an enjoyable funny and warm comedy nicholson is hilarious as melvin churning out insults with superb relish only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers hunt is also good as waitress carol and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson there also thankfully bit of chemistry between them kinnear as the gay neighbor seems to have slightly underwritten role he more of plot convience than character although his performance is good his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together in fact the scene stealer is simon dog who is funnier than nicholson but then again pets are always cute on screen providing solid support is cuba gooding jnr jerry maguire 1996 and yeardly smith who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons although gooding isn as good as is character in maguire he is still fun he overacts little but not so much as to be annoying smith is also good although she has fairly small role even director lawrence kasdan body heat 1981 makes an appearance as doctor but this is primarily nicholsons film and every scene he in he steals it he character is so hateful though it amazing that anyone talks to him at all especially carol and this is the films main problem it totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin she doesn fall in love with him naturally the film forces her to fall in love with him also melvins character seems to go too nice too quickly would doubt anyone with character like melvins would be able to turn back to nice loving person it would take helluva long time much longer than this film would like to make out brooks direction is good though if bit average but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones he tends to pile on to much schmaltz but generally he good there also nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer but generally as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie the movie is bit overlong but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly overall as good as it gets is fun movie even though it may be unbelivable and certainly worth seeing if just for jack nicholsons performance not quite as good as it gets pardon the bad joke but still good fun
just look back two years ago at the coen brothers comedic gem the big lebowski change the actors take away the bowling alley add record store and you ve got high fidelity or maybe the other way around since nick hornby novel high fidelity came first either way it been done before trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances yet it remains consistently funny why is this maybe because you know your life is much better than this you know these guys are more pathetic than you are and you know its ok to laugh at them because they re fictional director stephen frears possibly not intentionally has created movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours day when watching high fidelity expect to laugh at someone else pain realize what you are laughing at and then laugh again laughed at dick todd louiso the shy timorous steve buscemi character of lebowski who seems to know what he is talking about but either can put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends laughed at the john goodman character barry jack siyah an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons pudgy egotistic and obnoxious at the same time and laughed at rob john cusack the jeff bridges type whom the story revolves around rob is the character easiest to relate to but he is nothing like you at all he uncontrollably cheats and lies then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto woman and like his other miserable friends pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it whatever human emotions the clash aretha franklin and bruce springsteen records hold rob and co grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him but these aren any girlfriends these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob rob incessant use of lists show how pop music has played major role in his life the plot in three words is women and music the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective it gives high fidelity quickly paced informal structure adjectives which perfectly parallel rob own lifestyle it also helps open the viewer eyes as to how annoying barry is jack siyah steals the show with hilariously realistic performance as total sleaze ball just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob who must work with him every day of the week what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast consisting of big stars and character actors that really defines rob now instead of rob just talking to the camera after he explains something the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn end when it should have ended instead the movie goes on for torturous twenty minutes that seem lot longer than that also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in brief cameo halfway through the movie high fidelity is cheerful old fashioned comedy with voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen they make everyone look and feel great
plot human space astronaut accidentally falls upon planet ruled by apes he is taken prisoner along with some other humans and tries his best to escape his simian captors oh yeah and did mention that the apes can talk kewl critique despite this film not looking like tim burton movie or its lead human character showing any signs of being human being himself did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun summer fare although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make up jobs and characterizations mean was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real also have to give it up to all of the actors inside the costumes not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make up slobbered all over them for hours but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well especially enjoyed bonham carter performance who believed to be the most developed character in the entire film human or ape and tim roth bad guy who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part plot wise liked the beginning of the film the whole build up once wahlberg got into the village the escape and most of the fight scenes but once things got out into the deserted area and the final battle sequence kinda lost bit of my interest was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of human beings as animals then was about the end battle sequence which just seemed bit too typical for this kind of film also hated the kid character who just got on my nerves and didn really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved won ruin it here but mon guys you coulda thought of something little more plausible than that no but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter species love interests this dude didn seem to give rat ass about anyone but himself and ultimately didn really care about what happened to him either now not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script but the film suffered because of it visually the movie was also nice to look at especially the apes but definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton the surprise ending that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968 felt little tacked on here and despite being interesting didn really make all that much sense to me unless you look at it from sequel point of view so overall loved the whole feel of the planet the apes that ruled it the manner in which they treated the humans screamed shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain but didn appreciate the film lack of human character development why was kris kristofferson even in this movie and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring but would still recommend this film as fun summer movie with laughs creepiness and really cool premise ps for anyone who has seen the original cannot believe that they didn at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character in this case mark wahlberg goes nuts at the world in which he suddenly been thrust this is mad house type of thing the guy in this film barely seems to be put off by the fact that he surrounded by apes who can speak english where joblo coming from the arrival 10 battlefield earth 10 godzilla 10 instinct 10 mission to mars 10 pitch siyah 10 1968 planet of the apes 10 sleepy hollow 10
disaster films have tendency to be very formulated and very cliched to see disaster film with actual originality or at least decent plot twist would definitely be welcome surprise unfortunately folks it not likely dante peak is cliched and at times corny but also pretty decent to be honest wasn very interested in seeing this film and word of mouth as well as several reviews didn make it sound promising so was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn bad at all it pretty run of the mill but it not something would say is merely ok to watch in case you don know dante peak is about volcano and the city which lives in it shadow dante peak who would ve guessed eh pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future due to the lack of more substantial evidence nobody warns the small town and when they finally do it in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows brosnan all around good guy will of course save the day or at least the mayor of dante peak linda hamilton naturally the two will become infatuated with one another if you think just ruined plot development you haven seen very many movies there also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings and of course the kids or the dog at least one or the other will do something heroic but hey don want to ruin all the surprises if there was part of you that was hesitating seeing dante peak merely because it was rumored to be waste of time urge you to watch it and decide for yourself it not brain food but it succeeds at what it meant to be an enjoyable suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash
urban legend surprised me based on the last few films the genre has produced including but not exclusive to the likes of know what you did last summer disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween h20 was positive that was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena thankfully legend rose above it soggy premise to become not only hip scary and stylish entertainment but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year you re all familiar with the plot bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by masked maniac who identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be you guessed it everybody favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks the only person you didn suspect however just because legend doesn really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can qualify as first class entertainment it was believe it or not one of the funnest times ve had at the movies all year the thing is not really sure what made this particular stab pardon the pun at the genre seem so fresh and alive maybe it was the above par performances by the movie two leads jared leto and cybil actress alicia witt or it could have been the on target direction by jamie blanks more likely though it was because of the inspired premise don think need to tell you that killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than killer fisherman urban legend begins with sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film pretty young coed is driving down deserted road when gasp gas problem hee hee forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for refill one problem though would you want to stop at station run by brad dourif thought not predictably the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out problem with the credit card company it odd though when you pick up phone to realize that nobody on the other line naturally the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off and the when we least expect it whack decapitation it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car so who is it this time the obvious candidate is the slightly off kilter professor at the college the girl went to none other than freddy kruger himself robert englund who teaches class on urban legends ha or could it be the fame hungry local journalist leto looking for meaty story to put on his resume like all movies of this nature one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit and it turns out to be of course the one you didn suspect not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is but must give credit where credit is due and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been fun complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi ca
the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it adequately explained by the commercials with 11 days to go until the election the president who we never see calls in political dirty tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from burgeoning sex scandal deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce pageant phony war against albania fought on the mavi screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville with woody harrelson as the reluctant psychotic hero and if there wasn anything more to the movie than this it would be second rate heist comedy at best enlivened by great actors like sneakers goes to washington heist comedy yup deniro and hoffman are stealing the election so to speak and the movie is more about how they do it and the fun they have doing it than anything else wag the dog succeeds because it based one great truth the american people are stupid ok maybe it not love thy neighbor as thyself or even two plus two makes four but truth nonetheless any average person who thinks that they re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes moviemaking and the political process is invited nay challenged to spend week either watching movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching span when the house is in session and because we re so utterly predictably stupid hollywood knows that certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo washington knows that we won notice few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies and deniro character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won be able to locate albania on the map the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn light meaningless comedy about politics like speechless the michael keaton geena davis picture or from the level of light hearted politcal satire to near greatness nor is it hard edged cynical look at the manner in which morally deprived ethically challenged baby boomer connives his sleazy way into the beyaz house like primary colors and yes am little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out thanks for asking instead david mamet script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire it does this by keeping us in fantasy world where most of the schemers schemes come off beautifully and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion deniro is playing variation on his al capone character from the untouchables without any of the violent rages it all what do love what is it that brings me joy baseball minus the savage bloody beating with the bat he threatens lot of people mind you but he doing it in very nice polite way it very mellow restrained performance which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script hoffman on the other hand is giddy exuberant and joyous this kind of thing is what his character lives for and he so excited that he can even shut up even on the edge of disaster he bright eyed behind oddly tinted sunglasses and positive insiders note that he basing his character on some powerful but anonymous producer which may or may not be true but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets put on show electricity that you figure producer needs to have the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them listen to them talk in that wised up mamet dialogue get to know them better which we don anne heche is dead bang on in her portrayal of political press aide cool and composed on the outside panicked and frenzied on the outside denis leary one of my favorite actors see the ref is the fad king who handles the profitable back end shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative innovative ways to separate fool from his money they could make whole movie just about the fad king and go see it willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song to the weepy country waltz to the hilarious ballad of the green berets parody woody harrelson has brief but memorable part as the overmedicated hero of the albanian conflict craig nelson as the opposition candidate and the ever reliable william macy as wacky cia agent are given surprisingly short shrift one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing wag the dog is funny movie about serious problems the trivialization of american politics the role of the press in dumbing down the issues the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars the list goes on we can solve most of these problems by taking greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don
near the end of 1996 analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king the following year 1997 saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from studio other than the magic kingdom twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia at best that all it was sleeper hit designed to surprise but not shake the industry in 1998 however things have been decidedly different there have been number of pushes on disney death grip on the market and fifty one weeks into 98 new champion has emerged dreamworks the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed the other two contenders warner brothers quest for camelot and disney own annual entry mulan lacked inspiration and drive respectively although camelot was borderline abysmal and can really be considered shot at the title mulan had the makings of winner unfortunately it was saturated with traditional disney cute animation and lost points against the rapidly changing face of the competition in making the prince of egypt dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created genuinely unique product the animation is flawless and aside from bug life is the best looking movie to date the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects and the 2d 3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with the key to success however was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as method of advancing the plot namely some of the most important action sequences like the parting of the kirmizi sea were done almost entirely in 3d dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they ve got the stuff of success and that they re capable of challenging disney the story is also well written and the characters voiced with talent for the most part the plot follows its source material the book of exodus although only in the most general sense the writers took few creative liberties and most do not damage the story in any way in fact the shakespearean relationship between moses val kilmer and the pharaoh rameses ralph fiennes makes the story more interesting if anything moses hebrew is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in basket on the nile he floats into the pharaoh seti patrick stewart palace and is taken in by the royal family moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves by this time rameses is now pharaoh and the two brothers now on opposite sides of the line face off in battle of wills and divine intervention the cast of voices is most impressive and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock jeff goldblum danny glover and steve martin the script does not have lot of one liners in it and god is reduced to voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams but overall the story is exciting and interesting it decidedly for an older crowd and the tykes who haven had few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost but for those who make the bid the prince of egypt can be great watch

tried hard not like this movie without succeeding it contains parts of bringing up baby any hepburn tracy film part of the plot of war games cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday elevator shaft action train action and murder it is cute funny suspenseful little bit sexy little bit one of the bad guys was surprise the pace is fast enough there are some action scenes think that this is reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick julia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together really identified with the julia roberts character wishful thinking know but do have better hair her hair very dull dark brown has no color she could use some highlights they both do fine with their roles he bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she hotshot cub reporter with the chicago globe they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie like the one story focus other actors include charles martin smith as roberts boss olympia dukakis as nolte coworker nora dunn also with the chronicle and marsha mason as congresswoman basically this movie is reasonably fun there is serious mystery to solve and enjoyed following fun couple solving the mystery it is pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously do give successful comedy high marks
good films are hard to find these days great films are beyond rare proof of life russell crowe one two punch of deft kidnap and rescue thriller is one of those rare gems taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting an intelligent script and masterful directing together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days genuine motivation in story that rings true consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe character in proof of life making the moves on distraught wife played by meg ryan character in the film all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world haven seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah masterpiece the getaway but enough with the gossip let get to the review the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman david morse an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during mass ambush of civilians by anti government soldiers upon discovering his identity the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off and no one will step forward with the money with no choice available to her bowman wife alice ryan hires terry thorne crowe highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative to arrange the return of her husband but when things go wrong as they always do in these situations terry and his team which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year david caruso take matters into their own hands the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates complex and intelligent character driven vehicle filled with well written dialogue shades of motivation and convincing acting by all the actors the script is based on both book the long march to freedom and magazine article pertaining to kidnap ransom situations and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy screenwriter of the devil advocate and dolores claiborne the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan but that between crowe and david caruso dug out from movie hell caruso pulls off gutsy performance as crowe right hand gun while providing most of the film humor ryan cries lot and smokes too many cigarettes david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic gunslinger character of terry thorne the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes the bulk of those scenes which bookend the movie work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story characters the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise director taylor hackford mixes both his old school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of lars von trier film proof of life is thinking man action movie it is film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war and the sacrifices one makes for those choices the sacrifices that help you sleep at night
common complaint amongst film critics is why aren there more literate scripts available quiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing isn dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content paul attanasio script takes what could have been tepid thriller the quiz show scandals of the late 50s and delivers telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors the film is riddled with telling symbols 58 chrysler radio announcement of sputnik but is never heavy handed deft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script redford departs from the usually overlight cable tv quality sets and camera work so common in recent 20th century period pieces quiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years although was only years old when the twenty one scandal broke enough of the 50s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redford almost tangible palette from plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism of generation that had gone through 15 years of depression and world war without disposable income before the manifestation of its american dream the film deftly weaves several themes together from assimilation and exclusion of jews from the good life to the lengths that scion of literary family will go to to match his father fame though the 50s audience that is rocked by this scandal may initially seem naive to us they should appear all too familiar with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding charles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day the tv audience is almost fourth main character always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf at the film end the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same 50s tv audience mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff like the distorted mirror that captured blurred swastika at the end of cabaret this mirror may reflect an image we re not all that comfortable with
the caveman valentine starring samuel jackson ann magnuson aunjanue ellis tamara tunie screenplay by george dawes green based on his novel directed by kasi lemmons for more film dvd and books about movie reviews plus annual coverage of the toronto international film festival visit _film freak central_ http filmfreakcentral net now with search engine strange mixture of _shine_ _basquiat_ _angel

outside his new york cave one of ella fitzgerald strange fruit stuck in the crotch of tree young male model murdered and frozen to branch believing at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building is responsible for the murder romulus samuel jackson is put on the trail of an avant garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould david leppenraub colm feore his minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation romulus was brilliant julliard trained pianist prior to his psychosis romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police woman daughter aunjanue ellis that even though he nut that doesn mean that he can solve high profile society murder every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas and every character the same _the caveman valentine_ is concept so high concept that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment with romulus caveman slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane urban noir hero spawn with long vanished wife tamara tunie acting as spiritual guide the occasional social caste commentary the secret base in cave divergent genius personality with network of informants and supporters and wickedly colourful arch enemy the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such lavish extent that was vaguely surprised that the mavi police cars weren inscribed with gotham pd that being said _the caveman valentine_ can only really succeed as heroic fantasy frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of heart the difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of thriller or police procedural when in fact _the caveman valentine_ is superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless again like mcfarlane spawn while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts it is no small detail that our hero romulus is not only named for member of the ruling class who lived his life in legend without knowledge of his royal birth but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of mystical existence living in cave in park in the romulus mythology signs of romulus royal blood is brought by twelve vultures while in the film the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds but of the carrion itself whether or not romulus of _the caveman valentine_ will found nation or in the case of novelist george dawes green upon whose novel his own screenplay is based franchise the fact remains that _the caveman valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far it along with night shyamalan _unbreakable_ is mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has since miller seminal the dark knight returns redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics readers of sam keith brilliant the maxx comic series or of mtv short lived animated adaptation of the same are already familiar with the idea of homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne the failure of both the maxx tv show and of _the caveman valentine_ not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ suggests that the public may not be ready for america surprising contributions to dark fantasy luxuriantly lit brashly saturated and comic panel framed with virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent _death in venice ca_ while inhabiting robin standefer _practical magic_ mesmerizing sets _the caveman valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film kasi lemmons following up her brilliant 1997 debut _eve bayou_ which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism fulfills much of her immense promise with tale of seraphs and lost boys artists and suffering _the caveman valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in tilted landscape clearly not for every taste when approached with the correct paradigm it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year redefinition of the hero archetype for post modern audience with urine stained wool trench coats in place of mavi tights and kirmizi capes _the caveman valentine_ is fine and courageous film crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot rat alley wasteland
expand the final fifteen minutes of home alone into feature length film and you ve got baby day out an agreeably amusing children comedy about bumbling band of kid kidnappers who are unwittingly outwitted by an innocent infant the plot tracks trio of crooks posed as photographers mantegna pantoliano haley who steal nine month old bennington august cottwell iv aka baby bink from his old money home but the plan goes awry when baby crawls out an open window and into the streets of downtown chicago following the path of his favorite story called baby day out baby rides bus and visits the zoo and winds up at skyscraper construction site while baby stays unscathed the crooks fare worse for the wear the stooges get hit by boards and dropped from roofs and of course suffer multiple crotch injuries john wayne bobbitt should probably steer clear of this one like he did in planes trains and automobiles john hughes again demonstrates his mastery of the simple set up and extended execution here he aided and abetted by director patrick read johnson whose choreography could rival coen brother best bit baby crawling across busy city street baby day out has only two emotions awww and ouch and the actors play them accordingly forget the cartoon concern of lara flynn boyle or cynthia nixon disposable as mom and nanny respectively the ones to watch are the ones who are wincing joe mantegna is great head stooge barking lines like that little doo doo machine is my retirement money brian haley has great scene with gorilla while joe pantolianto plays curly to mantegna moe he is funny needless to say twins adam and jacob warton are adorable beyond belief
had chance to see sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night went in with the expectation of film with the similar flavor which made the original such success personal growth and insightful humor about life came away somewhat disappointed in this regard getting some of the latter and not much of the former the basic plot revolves around billy crystal who plays mitch robbins turning forty he now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original he given job at the radio station to his best friend played by daniel stern out of sympathy while stern character works through his divorce his loser younger brother john lovitz comes to mitch house to bum money and place to live all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday during the celebration mitch discovers what appears to be treasure map in curly the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance old hat after business trip to las vegas crystal stern and lovitz stay few extra days to go off in search of the treasure on the way they run into curly twin brother duke played by you know who jack palance first of all the cinematography was beautifully done especially the outdoor scenes in the desert the scenes are such that would like to see some of those sights filmed myself there is some character development during the film the actors remain true to their characters and play them well without overplaying the jokes the movie is good basic adventure with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict the movie is paced well but with couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end humor wise the film has good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film there are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by snake but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel surprise surprise for sequel right however the slight bitter aftertaste have with this film has to do mainly with the film manipulation of the audience the film tries to pull your heart strings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friend butt this is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original there were also some parts which appeared unrealistic like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didn worry more about water while tromping around the desert some strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here since the objective of the gang is to find altin and get rich unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey overall say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some story line deficiencies making it less worthy than the original it may be worth the full price of admission but matinee would be better bargain
we share the descent into darkness of talented boy pianist years later we see his subsequent resurfacing in the mid 80 damaged man walks out of rainstorm and back into the world the movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown based on the life story of david helfgott this australian film is rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon child genius compounded by the looming shadow of domineering father in the 1950 helfgott emerged as child prodigy the film traces his relationship with his father whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the siyah and beyaz keys david is offered places in the usa but his father refuses to let him leave australia the effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via single reverse tracked shot david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher house he is well lit via the external house lights his teacher isn home we pull back and see that the dark front room window has it curtains open there in pool of blackness is grand piano david fall over the dark cliff has begun instead of being told in linear mode shine jumps around in time ala pulp fiction this narrative device works well we see david as boy teenager in london and mental patient in various snippets the film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion adult helfgott return to the light is told in linear fashion the lead role is played by different actors with the teenage david taylor and adult david rush standing out whilst rush is known for his tv work in australia think this is his first major cinema work his david whilst clearly damaged he keeps quoting his daddy in babbling word torrent cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts is both touching and funny taylor teenage david is the more sympathy producing role we are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building his father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov 3rd whilst his teacher wants to start him with simple mozart technically this is beautiful film and lot of thought has gone in to the production particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects one scene has adult helfgott happily babbling in car in the rain the sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice with clever subtlety the wiper sound appears to morph into rhythmic thumping but of the same beat the image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of crowd but it us being clapped we are young david walking up to the stage for our first public show the music as you would expect from film of this subject matter is critical and it works very well the miming of the actors piano playing is faultless apparently rush didn mime he really did play helfgott life is certainly not without it sympathetic people indeed his return to the normal world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women his ultimately uplifting story is magic piece of theatre craft it shows that with the help of god we can all find our way back home
jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box sets on the video shelves he had feeling that economic deprivation was becoming tourist experience for the well off maybe it classic case of displacement it easier to see jarvis own lyrics obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall as fetishization of lowlife rather than leigh films but it worth being reminded that drab interiors and couple of working class characters don make for guarantee of authenticity let alone good film it the triumph of secrets lies then that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into probing of just what it means to seek authenticity and honesty in everyday lives following her adopted mother funeral hortense young siyah optometrist sets out to find her birth mother and is disturbed to find out that she is beyaz it is cynthia factory worker who lives in shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne cynthia younger brother maurice is successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages largely because of his wife animosity towards her hortense calls up cynthia who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to warm friendship eventually cynthia invites hortense to come along to party which maurice is hosting secrets lies has simple enough theme at its heart as one character puts it best to tell the truth isn it that way nobody gets hurt but if the film delivers much more than trite message it because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us hence cynthia difficulty with acknowledging first to herself then to others that hortense is her daughter one of her first reactions to seeing hortense is sincere denial that she has ever been with siyah man before long suppressed memory seizes her at the party cynthia pretense that hortense is her factory co worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies as agonizing as they are funny little lies seep into every corner like maurice pretending that he just dropping by when he visits cynthia after much deliberation maurice job as photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme sad looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile couple who pose awkwardly with prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles one of the most startling images is of beautiful woman with large scars on her face she says she needs the photo to look as bad as possible to collect insurance money yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars there are occasionally hilarious moments as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception ve got dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne if you ve got it flaunt it is what say as played by brenda blethyn cynthia comes close to being caricature with her nervous somewhat disconnected way of talking but she really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her precisely because she so needy of love perhaps indeed the whole cast gives warmly rounded detailed performances the script was developed partly through improvisations and the fusion of cast script and director shows best in the party scene seemingly everyone is talking at the same time and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout in very different way but also using long single shot the scene of hortense and cynthia first meeting in lonely caf=8a achieves touching intensity all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings the film climax with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen esque revelations and everybody hugging each other is the one thing that seems false about this film however it film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character lives when cynthia says near the end this is the life innit you get the sense that following the cynicism of his last film naked leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all without comforting illusions the flying inkpot rating system wait for the video little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
it ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director cut of the film films such as aliens the abyss the wild bunch blade runner and terminator are all prime examples of filmmaker integrity later chopped up or mucked with by the studio the advent of the dvd format has provided more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson 1995 masterpiece the professional which is known as on around the world is prime example of how good film can become an instant classic as director cut for years have heard of an international version available only in laserdisc format which has eluded me for years even bought laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors cuts including on but after countless searches in laserdisc stores could never find it until now the film follows the story of on played by jean reno professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello he lives next door to ferociously independent 12 year old girl named mathilda played by then newcomer natalie portman whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops one day crew of the cops lead by gary oldman in an over the top performance kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries taking pity on her on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life mathilda learns of on hit man profession and decides to follow in on footsteps as cleaner she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within on he has kept locked away as part of his profession at this point the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in the international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of on and mathilda footage that american censors deemed too explicit assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda and on motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops there even previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean hugues anglade star of queen margot besson la femme nikita and killing zoe with these additional scenes replaced on and matilda relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes the film becomes primarily heavy emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film the film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema my advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional throw down twenty bucks and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece director writer luc besson producer luc besson claude besson starring jean reno natalie portman gary oldman danny aiello

october sky is rare oddity in cinema self proclaimed uplifting film that is actually uplifting based on the autobiographical book by homer hickam rocket boys october sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching for their dream it 1957 and for the boys of coalwood west virginia there not much hope of rosy future coalwood is coal mining town and except for the few lucky ones who manage to escape on football scholarship most of coalwood boys are destined to work in the mine but in october 1957 an event happens that sparks one boy to dream the launch of the soviet satellite sputnik sets homer hickam jake gyllenhaal to dream future of rocketry and space travel of course homer parents chris cooper and natalie canderday aren quite sure what to make of their son unusual interests homer gets his strongest encouragement from miss riley laura dern teacher in his school who also informs him about the scholarships offered to the winners of national science fair and so with stars in his eyes and thoughts of scholarships in his head homer enlists the help of three other boys william lee scott chad lindberg and chris owen and begins to build rocket but do these four backwoods boys even have the slightest hope of escaping their destiny there is lot that could have gone wrong with october sky nearly every sequence flirts with becoming syrupy and cliched however miraculously october sky avoids nearly all of these pitfalls making the exact right moves at the exact right times film emerges which manages to be powerful and moving without slipping into the gauzy haze of nostalgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness jake gyllenhaal is outstanding as the kid at the center of this film >from the outset of the film he is immediately likable and never seems too corny or brainy as to alienate the audience unfortunately while october sky focuses on homer the other three kids get the short end of the stick they remain little more than placeholders reading insert friend here of the adults in the film chris cooper is the most fully realized character the film never paints him as merely the villainous parent standing in the way of his child dreams but instead shows the multihued portrait of man who wants the best for his family and town but is too stubborn to realize what that is director joe johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating the many obstacles that october sky manages to dodge however there are still few occasions when he allows things to proceed just step too far scenes which were natural and inspiring start to become contrived and artificial however these lapses are minimal and johnson quickly steers the movie back on course the problem with many so called uplifting films is that they attempt to force their mediciney goodness down your throat october sky never resorts to that level and yet manages to become truly uplifting film purely on its own merits
slavery is bad after hundreds of years we ve finally figured that one out this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg latest serious film during the late 1830s portuguese slave ship carries cargo of siyah men and women kidnapped from their home on africa west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery fifty three of them are stuffed into the la amistad from spanish word for friendship by their new spanish owners freeing himself from his chains senge pieh djimon hounsou renamed cinque by his masters leads bloody revolt after killing most of the crew the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home or so they think instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property if they are property who do they belong to their masters the spanish government salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship the us government the defendants are pawns in several games abolitionists theodore joadson morgan freeman and lewis tappan stellan skarsgard want to free them but tappan sees them primarily as means to further the cause their lawyer roger baldwin matthew mcconaughey views the case as simple one of property rights and chance to make his share of legal fees south carolina senator john calhoun arliss howard pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states president martin van buren nigel hawthorne is willing to force the result towards his own political ends when the verdict looks to free the africans van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes even that doesn work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims at the urging of calhoun the president then appeals the case to the supreme court populated by majority of slave owners this little known try finding it in any history text book incident from america past would have gone down darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court the slavery issue is easy pickin for spielberg much like his shindler list which followed jurassic park as this follows lost world the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose nazis and slave traders both treat groups of others as less than human it not hard to see who the bad guys are without that question to ponder the director job is more difficult he has to make the story interesting spielberg succeeds for the most part the visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach where the movie falls down is bit more subtle there are very few _people_ in the tale in fact cinque is the only character who is fleshed out tappan and joadson are abolitionists symbols but not humans van buren is weak politician but nothing else the rest of the slaves barely exist other than dressing for the set like many other films about people of color almost all the major players are beyaz the film salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou the former model first major role is winner without speaking more than five words of english he conveys more emotion than most actors with thousand lines of dialog the other stand out is hopkins who seems to be making career out of portraying american presidents he also played the title role in nixon the impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court room drama ever on the screen there are some other great moments especially impressive are the african struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land their interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant as grand as the epic is it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans more humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it four star film michael redman has written this column for real long time and is just now getting around to seeing some 1998 films
gothic murder mystery yarns are not new conceit in fact they ve been around in books and on film for many many years without the proper handling they come off as old fashioned bland and outdated the gift directed by sam raimi is tried and true effort that surprises very little and includes everything from wide array of suspects and kirmizi herrings to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front to the eventual discovery of waterlogged corpse found in nearby pond it fairly obvious who the killer is in fact predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions the film ultimately shouldn work but it does thanks to sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other annie wilson cate blanchett is recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale hilary swank who is severely abused by her husband donnie keanu reeves and buddy cole giovanni ribisi an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he been having about mysterious mavi diamond that is somehow linked to his father for annie she does not give the readings merely for money but uses it as way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone future her late grandmother rosemary harris told her as child that it was gift she was given and she should always remember that when annie eldest son is involved in fight at school she meets the nice guy school principal wayne collins greg kinnear whom she finds herself attracted to but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king katie holmes whom annie immediately gets negative vibe about at party with her best friend linda kim dickens annie stumbles upon jessica in compromising position with lawyer david duncan gary cole soon after jessica has disappeared leaving everyone in frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale and the pond behind his home the gift may be cliched on sheer storytelling level but the performances and tight direction from raimi who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film 1999 for love of the game lift the picture up several notches slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights the disappearance of jessica at the 30 minute mark divulges the movie true intentions and transforms the proceedings into taut at times frightening horror mystery at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett 1999 the talented mr ripley who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than run of the mill protagonist into very exact down to earth realistic person with valid troubles and caring attitude towards those around her blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it giving the entire film truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing both as character and an actress blanchett isn the only bright performer as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year in her first role following her oscar win for 1999 boys don cry hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie who seeks guidance from annie but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all to leave the grossly abusive donnie as donnie keanu reeves 2000 the watcher makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all for the often criticized reeves whose acting abilities have never been the best this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get and it is also one of the better performances he has given giovanni ribisi 2000 the boiler room is heartbreaking as mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad in the small but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king katie holmes 2000 wonder boys has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before and she is radiant in her few scenes finally kim dickens 2000 hollow man makes her usual strong impression as annie spicy best friend linda the other notable aspect of the gift is its moody atmosphere that lays such thickly foreboding air over every scene it almost suffocating thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and very good music score by christopher young the movie not only achieves scary undercurrent but one that is filled with dread helped along by strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast the gift is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills and offers up fair share of chills too it may not be groundbreakingly original but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time
clue is an unfairly ignored comedy very similar to 1976 murder by death this big screen version of the classic board game what next chutes and ladders the motion picture is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue the plot for what it worth has all the characters from the game in this case the names from the game are used as aliases meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr boddy lee ving the man who been blackmailing them all when he turns up dead everyone including the audience must figure out whodunnit and in what room and with what object while not as witty as neil simon murder by death clue definitely has it moments it has so many moments in fact that use lot of the lines from the film when joking around with my friends to this day whenever someone says the phrase well to make long story short have the follow up phrase too late ready to go the cast all very good comedic talents play well off one another while the late madeline kahn as the dark and sultry mrs beyaz sometimes steals the film away from the rest and colleen camp as the french maid yvette displays some of her natural talents as well clue is available on dvd from paramount home video it includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 85 and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions and features the original theatrical trailer french language audio track is also available the trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not and it even includes scene not in the film itself scene that should have been in the film as it good joke also the trailer is scored to the music from airplane which was an interesting choice when clue played in theaters it ran with the gimmick of three different endings if you wanted to see all three you had to go to the movies three separate times so when the film was released on home video rather than releasing three separate videos all three endings were included on one tape the first two endings being what if endings and the third ending being the actual ending now for the dvd release you get two choices you can watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you note there an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this after watching the film with randomly selected ending when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it when you do secret menu opens allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves now while applaud the effort of paramount here as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc it just doesn work well first why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch maybe someone like myself who seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only no technical dvd expert but can imagine that being too hard to accomplish secondly the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious thereby becoming distraction right when you definitely don need distraction finally the back of the dvd case states and now with this special dvd version you can see all surprise endings have no idea why they would word it that way since that not special feature in the slightest the video has been out for fifteen years now good lord has it been that long and it played on television with all three endings all the time these are merely minor complaints however seeing that ve watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd the picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy and thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format [pg]
people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels stories comic books or movies often science fiction aficionados find material previously labelled as science fiction to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror or rather simple techno thriller in such cases mistakes are understandable genre boundaries are never clearly marked but believe there are really few cases when movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff 1983 film directed by philip kaufman the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits but the right stuff film isn even fiction it was based on the non fiction book by tom wolfe covering the early years of american space program the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base major test site for experimental planes the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach mach speed and thus break the sound barrier many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado but one quiet pilot chuck eager played by sam shaped succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records ten years later soviets have launched sputnik marking the beginning of the space age in order to regain national prestige us government decides to be the first to send man into space best air force navy and marine pilots are recruited into program but not yeager because he lacks college education and desired all american image in one of critics polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman film looks quite atypical for its time with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s age when hollywood used to make films larger than life but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original memorable movies the right stuff was the last of them swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual risk taking artsy projects the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film the plot is almost non existent and not very coherent the story featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots embodied in yeager to new generation of the astronauts the film also lacks conventional protagonist yeager who also appears in small cameo remains the true hero of the film but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives making this movie into ensemble piece that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents until that specialised only for bit or character roles sam shepard is great as yeager war hero whose greatest achievement breech of the sound barrier remained obscured in history books probably due to his own modesty on the surface he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases shepard performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean cut marine and future politician john glenn young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom superbly played by fred ward always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and arguably first american man in space alan shepard kaufman left room for female talents to excel too barbara hershey pamela reed veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots wives royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice president lyndon johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman superb direction most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert as virtual unknowns far away from strict rules and discipline everything seems natural yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world in that setting it quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights but the times are changing ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war and natural pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined conventional pilots their entire lives become focus of media frenzy and their job is subjected to strict rules meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats publicity seeking politicians and uncaring scientists like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun played by scott beach only to preserve their most basic human dignity this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity mercury astronauts receive fame and fortune although some of them even before going in the space those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman superb use of poetic movie language editing is great and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion the same image would be copied in many latter films although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military which provided authentic locations and period equipment he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space another fine contribution of this film is oscar awarded musical score by bill conti still tremble from excitement every time hear it it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period this film is great and its cult status is well deserved but there are some minor flaws some of the mercury astronauts aren fleshed out enough although being played by fine actors like lance henriksen film also lacks proper closure on the other hand most logical conclusion of the film landing on the moon would require this film to be more than six hours long also some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians who were portrayed as evil monsters just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan america in some of contemporary interviews kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible and in order to do that he portrayed russians not as they were in real life but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s time has passed now we don see astronauts as heroes in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up but this film sentimental reminder of the times when future began perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow mercury astronauts footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky and even if they decide to stay on earth they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema
the celebration is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant you know where you sit down to watch it and no matter what you ve heard about it before you just can help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like don really feel there are to be any real rules for cinema film can do anything as long as it makes it work but do ask that all films have one thing in common they create experiences when watch film no matter what kind of film it is want to be able to take certain memories along with me the celebration is great because it chock full of those it creates world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life and then it makes things just tad bit farscial just to make sure you re paying attention which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored then you re of your attention span needs bit of tuning up the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch henning mortizen who has just turned 60 and is having party thrown for him all his friends and family turn up and for the first half hour we get introduced to everyone simplistically and realistically no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here the eldest son christian ulrich thomsen looking bit like young malcolm mcdowell is the first to be seen in the film walking to his father home his brother michael thomas bo larsen drives by pulls over greets him then kicks his family out of the car forcing them to walk to the estate just so christian can be comfortable we then meet helene paprika steen their sister woman who always seems to be stressed out who invites the driver of her car gbatokai dakinah an american to to come join her at the party she going to once they re all there and settled in the party begins and as custom the eldest son has to make speech to his dad so christian stands up at the head of the table and reveals the film punchline his father raped all his children at young age but since this is family friends affair his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth and is simply brushed off despite his efforts and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir and it all terribly interesting to watch twists occur and soon the film has taken on nearly farsical nature but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends the most notorious thing about this film which has been getting the most notice though is that the director thomas vinterberg has shot it in completely awkward fashion as member of the danish filmmakers clan dogme 95 group that has vowed to oppose the auteur concept make up illusions and dramaturgical predictability so that they may purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot have not seen breaking the waves the other notable film by member of this group lars von trier to be exact but the celebration works exquisitely in this department it feels like reality like you re actually watching real people and not actors and as major pointer has been shot on video as result it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film but always wanted to we see key moments in people lives that they wouldn dare show to the world and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style as ironically showmanship as it really is works perfectly for the nature of the film the key though to this film and the reason it not just cool danish import is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth throughout the film we see completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies debate so three dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the truth at all costs reasoning out of the water of course it was not right for the father to rape his children and of course they couldn have fought back then and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them and yes it thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier but then again the father after all is not totally bad guy and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier we also see man who has also learned to live with what he done and deep down feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface the final scene involving mortizen and everyone else is utterly devastating thanks to him and thomsen whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex everyone else is flawless as well the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them the actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays exactly like life as such the celebration may be the one truly bizarro film of the year work of art so eerily close to reality that it utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating
most movies seem to release third movie just so it can be called trilogy rocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category but manages to be slightly unique the rocky formula of rocky loses fight rocky trains rocky wins fight is carried out to the letter also the tradition of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well this movie begins with series of clips showing how famous rocky sylvester stallone has become even showing brief appearance on sesame street then it moves on with rocky being in fixed fight with thunderlips hulk hogan mysterious bad ass known as clubber lang mr trash talks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he pities the fool for not coming out and fighting him outright rocky trainer burgess meredith tells rocky not to fight but the italian stallion doesn listen naturally he gets his ass kicked somewhere along the line after this several things happen rocky longtime trainer dies causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed rocky wife complains to her husband that he should fight the final fight ensues between clubber and rocky guess who wins the winner name rhymes with smocky the movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber lang over the top performance the dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film which is good if you like fighting scenes the last match is quite decent actually if you liked the previous films rent this one it well worth seeing if you are fan of the series but if you can stand rocky shouting adrianne one more time see something else
review dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders living with his grandfather jehan jack warden in poverty nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times they are renting spare one room cottage and the greedy malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the house if they don pay the rent nello also has rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that have ever seen in either movie or in real life his hero is peter paul rubens the great flemish painter of the 17th century not that these are the only things that make nello life happy however he has dog of flanders whom he names patrasche who is heroic rin tin tin of the 19th century whom he rescues from his cruel unkind master in addition he even has best friend and future sweetheart in the lovely wealthy aloise whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower class nello he thinks he not good enough for her and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying but then he was poor guy himself before he married as mentioned later on in the film one day nello encounters mysterious yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande played wonderfully by jon voight who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart and that perhaps one day he might land career in being an artist and every christmas there is contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year the winner getting lot of money eager to save his home and his aging dying grandfather nello willingly decides to become an artist asking aloise to pose for him one night the two travel to circus where they have their fortune told one of the film most delightful scenes that great happiness is destined for them she gives the kids ring whom nello places on aloise hand afterwards the two kids have rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers unfortunately things are not all `la dee dah in this tale aloise father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again bad enough that they can see each other although we know nello and aloise don we but that only the start of nello troubles aloise farm is burned down and nello is wrongfully accused by the landord of his cottage for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise this decreases nello reputation around the town save aloise and her parents and kindly miller william who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by matters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies and he has to pay for his funeral but then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home for not paying his rental permanetly this means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold freezing wind worst of all the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time `the portrait of the princess fails to win the prize at the festival now nello and patrasche are really depressed and close to freezing to death will nello be able to find any happiness in his life will patrasche save the day will nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise dog of flanders is delightful heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages even older ones who consider themselves too `sophisticated for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown ups too there have been other movies of this ilk boy and dog and while this one falls into that category it is mostly story about overcoming difficulties and finding good home for yourself move over or rather roll over old yeller this dog of flanders is heartwarming delight the cinematography courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful and really adds to the powerful drama of the film it also gives feel of being in flanders the whole film was respectably shot in flanders the music from richard friedman is also remarkable an evocative poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century the opening song over the credits is very beautiful hope the soundtrack is available and there brief excerpt of `cheer up charlie from willy wonka and the chocolate factory sung by aloise to nello in another delightful scene the cast is first rate jesse james and jeremy james kissner who play nello are some of the most endearing adorable young stars have ever seen in my whole life so are the girls who play aloise madyline sweeten as the younger and farren monet as the older not that they are the only good stars however jack warden is ideal as jehan eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming touching ones also bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william he another one of my favorite characters in the film but jon voight as mentioned before is the perfect choice for michel he brings mysterious yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he can win the contest but what makes this film fun to watch is how well defined the characters are and the pace of the story best of all it has happy ending though will not give it away sorry is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters for the first time since the beginning of 1999 there comes film which doesn rely on popular formula stuff such as big budget special effects commercial rock soundtracks or any of that stuff this one relies on telling fully character oriented story with just the right amount of heart humor and drama that to me is what makes dog of flanders all the more delightful eleanor sullivan of `the home news tribune noticed this and was kind and generous enough to welcome it `for want of better word glow surrounds dog of flanders its heart is in the right place and it engages you you can guess where the film is going because this is well traveled territory but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner an often told story is well worth revisit in addition there were couple of other enthusiasts such as chicago sun times and the washington post you should read their reviews they re really positive other critics however were not so kind stephen holden of `the new york times had more than share of beatings to lay upon dog of flanders via pen writing he found the film to be `sea of sugary bromides and condemned mr voight character as `hopelessly wooden adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda in addition `entertainment weekly slam dunked the film condemning it as `the worst family film of the year there have been so many other bad reviews like this too my suggestion disregard the critics they just have big problem with touching family films and one should never pay attention to them this dog of flanders may only be little `family movie it probably won be big hit in the style of titanic but then again no other film has been since then but that is not bad thing in and of itself this is story that is sure to warm your heart and that is what really matters about dog of flanders it is also one of the better family films around this year none of the other films have seen this year though they were good have been so low key and touching if you re looking for family style entertainment look no further than this charming boy and dog yarn go see it while you still can for as mentioned it might not be big bow wow at the box office for long time see it while you can there is really no need to compare multi million dollar blockbuster such as star wars episode the phantom menace or tarzan or even the iron giant with tender sweet little family movie
contact shows why jodie foster is one of our best actresses see contact with your family it is movie for all ages review by stuart cracraft contact starring jodie foster matthew mcconaughey john hurt director robert zemeckis star after predictable mit phillip morrison powers of 10 zoom out start which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof morrison work contact picks up steam gradually building by the end an irresistable juggernaut and very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out of balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological geek side by the end the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do evoke sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what out there this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high tech movies however except for jodie foster elie arroway and john hurt hadden who are both actors of exceptional caliber the supporting cast are not especially impressive hurt certainly has had better roles stephen ward in scandal this one as the multi billionare hadden does not do his acting skills justice this is clearly foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation foster radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms early scenes take long long time to build up to this the movie pacing is very good and subtle the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful the politics of foster character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however one of the most entertaining but very short scenes is when foster is confronted by rob lowe during cabinet level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation there were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored it is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters everything else was very one sided foster lowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table the core scene of the movie is set on surrealistic beach on far away world in the starsystem of vega it feels lot like science fiction writer john varley scenes in his book steel beach where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence in one case computer manufactured by mankind itself and in foster case an illusion drawn from her memory in another sense this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry star trek pilot the cage later the menagerie when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens the concept is not new by any sense in the world of science fiction but the beach scene which is the centerpiece of the film as is the whole film is driven by foster freed from her needs to direct by director zemecki foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast as the movie gains speed foster acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her it is certainly oscar caliber acting unquestionably the supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor with some president clinton cameos cleverly manipulated george stephanopolus style to seem very forrest gump in fact zemeckis et al got in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie vis vis clinton but the audience attended this movie with just had some good chuckles at clinton walk ons the much discussed tension between science and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course though it is helpful to those in the audience who have not also the near final scene in senate judiciary hearing room is disappointing contact is fitting memorial to the memory of carl sagan science popularizer and sometime pedantic gadfly of the halls of academe perhaps now sagan can be said to be with his dragons of eden
the booming introduction music finishes and the camera sweeps over kirmizi mountains we see two figures looking over barren and very kirmizi landscape they kiss then walk on one of the characters schwarzenegger slips and falls the glass on his mask cracks his face scruches up and his eye begin to pop then doug quaid played by schwarzenegger wakes up it all been dream he wakes up next to his beautiful wife played by stone and the film begins total recall is typical sci fi film wrapped around an intresting if far fetched plot quaid who has never been to mars keeps on having dreams of the planet which has now been colanised one day while riding on train he see ad for company called rekall which implants memories of holiday instead of you actually going there yourself quaid chooses the secret agent on mars memory and then the really hits the fan the implant goes wrong and quaid really thinks he is an agent on mars for about two minutes until he goes back to normal and can remember thing however everyone he knows his workmates his wife turn against him saying how blabbed about mars and blew his cover on the mission strange man called richter played by ironside wants to kill him quaid now hopelessly confused follows the advice given to him by friend he get his ass to mars mars is ruled by cohagen played by cox who charges people for air against him are the rebels who are mainly mutants the rebel need quaid to defeat cohagen because quaid knows but can remember yet about reactor that produces air eventually quaid kills cohagen turns on the reactor saves the planet and goes away with beautiful girl just like the guy at rekall promised him throughout this plot there is huge explosions thousands of deaths and mean lot of death swearing sex and everything else that make good verhoeven director of basic instinct and starship troopers movie naturally there some pretty imaginative deaths with arms getting ripped off someone getting drilled and heads exploding as you can tell it violent stuff but it done so stylishly and of course arnie tones it down with one liner that it excusable the acting is variable arnie of course is useless but he goes has some good lines and in the first twenty minutes he even act like normal bloke not like some action hero stone of course is useless making pretty poor wife and pretty poor action hero but she does sex scenes alright ticoton most recently seen in con air again is ok doing some good action but getting her emotions all wrong one minute she hates quaid the next she loves him and she never gets this tranisition right so the good guys are awful but the bad guy are excellent cox is basically reprising robocop but he still great in this and he delivers the best line in the whole film near the end ironside is superbly evil with an utterly emotionless face the supporting cast are fine and not even the comedy sidekick this time in the form of taxi driver is annoying one disappointing aspect though are the special effects ilm and dreamquest do some good work such as subway station scene but the model work is not so good some of the model heads look appaling fake and quatto is major disappointment another irritating thing is the product placement there are lot of plugs and good mars today gag however the sets look great and the special effects at the end of the film aren too bad either there also good soundtrack running through by jerry goldsmith the omen poltergeist star trek the motion picture overall then total recall is hugely violent yet hugely enjoyable action fest with reasonable plot thrown in there too some great bad guys and some imaganitive death for schwarzenegger movie this is not bad at all in fact it very good
the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made know that is very sweeping statement so ll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of science fiction stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot 2001 space odyssey is probably better film but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be science most all other films we normally classify as science fiction or sf are really just fantasy action or horror stories set in futuristic setting the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in high tech for 1970 van looking for crashed satellite in tiny new mexico town something bad happens to them pictures from reconnaissance plane show shocking sight apparently everyone in the town is dead the authorities call wildfire alert summoning four scientists all but one of them somewhat reluctant to super secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada two of scientists stone and hall fly directly to the town in space suits and find town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks their blood turned to powder in their veins some went insane before they died and two of them baby and an old wino are miraculously still alive they take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab where stone pressures the beyaz house to call up directive 712 an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with nuclear bomb what they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth like life and mutates as it grows their only hope to cure it is to find out what perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet they barely call off the bombing in time but then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out this triggers the lab last ditch defense mechanism an atomic bomb to those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow much of the film is lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts but what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw the performances are universally fine with the actors keeping things low key and restrained just like scientists to me the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting we follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in way we don expect this film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it it was originally rated when first released but it now carries the pg rating mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which body wrist is slashed spilling its powdered blood
my fellow americans is movie that at first glance looks to have little substance or movie that we ve all seen million times two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins this is exactly what happened in this movie but fortunately they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way the movie starts with quick and do mean quick glance of two presidents russell kramer jack lemmon and matt douglas james garner william haney dan aykroyd and ted matthews john heard are the new president and vice president there is scandal that arises involving kickback from contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago he finds scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead this movie was exceptional for many reasons one being that they found people lemmon and garner that have good chemisty together they worked very well as unit and they mirrored each other perfectly one being ladies man and one being the old man ll let you fiqure which is which also they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman except then he was congressman experience counts for lot
in the muse albert brooks plays steven phillips hollywood screenwriter who after winning humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio they claim that he lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them he knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over so he turns to his best friend jack jeff bridges another screenwriter who enjoyed success after success on the way over to jack house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman sharon stone into cab and begins to think is he having an affair when confronted jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is in fact muse mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity and has helped him garner his success she doesn do any actual writing he is told but inspires you steven is excited by what he hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if she ll take steven on as new client jack arranges meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her present preferably something from tiffany after the meeting the muse sarah decides to take on steven but at price she wants suite at the four seasons and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her like bringing her salads in the middle of the night steven wife andy macdowell sees him at food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon steven confesses everything and although at first suspicious she later allows sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he going through for her and that question only time will tell the muse is albert brooks sixth film as writer director actor he co wrote with monica johnson and although it good movie it not up to the level of his best works defending your life and mother the problem lies in the script and for movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor there aren nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite few good one liners it has great premise but doesn deliver up to it full potential but like albert brooks in this film and think that we can all identify with steven phillips little bit he may whine and complain but he just wants to support his family and be happy and like sharon stone in this movie too it nice change of pace for her and also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner james cameron and martin scorsese and although the muse doesn have as much to say about hollywood as robert altman the player still left the theater feeling good and that something wish got out of more movies
disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure mulan while it adheres bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults fa mulan ming na wen singing lea salonga wants nothing more than to be dutiful daughter and honor her family it just that she doesn quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker miriam margoyles mulan would prefer speaking her mind but there is trouble on the horizon the evil huns led by shan yu miguel ferrer are invading china the emperor pat morita has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army the only male in mulan family is her father fa zhou soon tek oh who old and with bad leg honorably accepts his fate mulan on the other hand decides to save her father life by secretly masquerading as man and taking his place on the battlefield mulan under the assumed name of ping appears at camp where she along with the other bumbling recruits yao harvey fierstein chien po jerry tondo and ling gedde watanabe are trained in the art of war by captain shang wong singing donny osmond but she not alone in her tasks in typical disney fashion she has three animal companions her horse khan lucky cricket crickey and pint sized guardian dragon called mushu eddie murphy much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn flow well with the rest of the more serious story sure some occasional comic relief is welcome particularly in film geared for the younger set but mulan overdoes it the overdose of humor turns what could have been powerfully great film into good but schizophrenic experience but that commentary aside this is very well made film which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable the animation is on par with some of disney best the story itself is interesting and the action scenes are awe inspiring the musical score to the film is enjoyable though as has been the case with disney recent work the songs are mostly forgettable at least we re only subjected to four of them this time around mulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date most of the killing is off screen and it all highly depersonalized there nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi mom there nothing graphic and the film resides snugly inside rating children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies it ironic that film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor ax the compulsory songs and remove the obligatory and somewhat unrealistic romance they could have had classic on their hands instead they merely deliver very good time at the movies
synopsis an attractive mute makeup artist working on an ultra cheesy slasher movie in moscow witnesses the production of brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians meanwhile the artist sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her comments mute witness came as surprise to me the first time watched it drawn by the clever artwork on the video box rented the film expecting complete turkey mute witness however was original offbeat and well made it one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about ve subsequently found it at most video rental places visit and it may be seen on occasion on the independent film channel the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense as billy the quite believable mute heroine sees members of the russian mob brutally kill prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy vulnerable position as mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures to throw curveball into the fray billy sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film look for alec guinness obi wan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy in small role as the evil reaper definately check this movie out although as word of warning it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which certainly aren for the squeamish
desperate measures was something was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released summer 97 for some reason it was delayed until hollywood traditional dumping ground january now that it out see no real reason for that delay as it simple yet highly entertaining film michael keaton stars as maniacial murderer who bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of san francisco police detective garcia keaton agrees to the transplant only so he can attempt escape he succeeds in plan that of course could only work in the movies the police force is now trying to kill keaton while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son the film definately has it flaws the plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status also after keaton escape garcia captain barks at him how many men have to die to save your kid life which the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark the thing is it vaild point how many people have to be needlessly crippled burned and killed just to save this one child what the greater good here many lives or one life if movies really had guts nowadays would have loved to have seen this movie come down to final choice for garcia character place him in situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else alas movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable despite few silly moments and one or two really stupid ones the good things about desperate measures outnumber the bad the main highlight would be keaton performance the character could have easily been an overacting scene chewing freak but keaton underplays it nicely he not as menacing as he was in pacific heights or even as menacing as he was in batman yes kids batman used to be dark character but you certainly get the idea that he evil even the final scene of the film which normally would just hate seems strangely appropriate for this film so much so that didn mind it in the slightest and another bonus the film takes place in san francisco which usually means car chase on those hills that you ve seen billion times before and for moment it looked as though it was about to happen but it doesn and that creative [r]
trekkies roger nygard energetic and hilarious documentary brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non fans alike the film generally writes off the trekkies vs trekker polemic as not worth arguing about the good spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable loud giggles yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and certain awe denise crosby who played tasha yar on star trek the next generation serves as the host in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary oed the oed cites february 1976 caption in the new yorker as the first recorded usage of the word unless you ve been to the conventions posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans one pointed out apologetically that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams arguably the most famous of all the trekkies she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die hard fans do her claim to fame is that as juror on the whitewater trial she wore it in court as well every day would walk past the reporters with vulcan like stoicism she says describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession she doesn quite understand all of the uproar an officer of the federation 24 hours day she reminds us her fealty to her hobby approaches that of religious faith along with the laugher the show evokes there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty and their infectious joy provokes certain envy of their enjoyment few other avocations could give this much satisfaction these people are having the time of their lives for the record not star trek fan although have seen some of the movies the film interviews the various star trek series stars as well as its fans the stars had thought the convention idea was lark and would soon fade but over twenty years later the conventions are still going strong filled with anecdotes the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions at one the actor who plays was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel after appearing briefly he drank some water and left they decided to auction off his half empty glass joking that it had the virus the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the virus too with dedication comes certain amount of stupidity not just flitting among people the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies one guy is trekkie cross dresser another dresses her cat and then there is the dentist the dentist has his entire office made up to look like star trek set he his oral hygienists his receptionist his wife and his kids wear the outfits all of the time it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home but not his family for variety he and his family do change characters from time to time he says his patients like it well there was this one complainer but he had problem with his bill anyway there are summer schools for klingon with ph linguists to teach the language hamlet is now available in klingon albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore and they are working on translating the bible they even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs even customs the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns sandwiched in between the levity the switch in tone doesn work the incessantly up beat film ends with singing elvis impersonator he fits right in trekkies runs breezy 26 it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages
if you re the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland you re going to love the hunt for kirmizi october you ll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics or if you re sean connery or alec baldwin fan or if you admired director john mctiernan earlier films die hard and predator in fact the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for kirmizi october are those who have read the book since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them the hunt for kirmizi october is an epic thriller adapted from tom clancy best selling novel set in an era before glasnost the movie revolves around top secret soviet submarine called the kirmizi october the nuclear sub has revolutionary propulsion system which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection the kirmizi october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius played by sean connery ramius has strict orders just to test the submarine but he has other ideas he takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean is he planning to start world war iii cia analyst jack ryan doesn think so he convinced that ramius plans to defect to the ryan played by alec baldwin is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub the characters in the hunt for kirmizi october are paper thin but the performances thankfully are rock solid baldwin and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor sam neil gives sturdy performance as connery somber first officer it ironic to see neil and connery playing russians since they are both best known for their roles as british agents connery as james bond and neil as reilly ace of spies the large cast also includes scott glenn james earl jones tim curry and joss ackland plus richard jordan as the smooth national security adviser the special effects are remarkable but more than anything the hunt for kirmizi october is distinguished by its water tight plot screenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated kirmizi october through story line full of twists and turns they keep us involved in the action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment the movie doesn get as sweaty or breathless as die hard because it would rather tell good story than hit you over the head with non stop action the finale is rousing and suspenseful but essentially the hunt for kirmizi october is superior potboiler
was pleasantly surprised by this film with budget topping $200 million was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century greatest tragedies would make film exciting enough to see how much could you dress up the sets how many models and computer effects could you use how much more action could you pack into ship that sinks oh if ve just given away part of the plot for you go back to school after having viewed titanic however found it to be well paced well designed and overall well made movie there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best ve seen titanic tells its story in two time periods it starts out in the present when ocean explorer brock lovett bill paxton and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic searching for priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship what they find instead is drawing of woman wearing the necklace which is broadcast on the news the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas there she tells her story to lovett and his team in 1912 rose dewitt bukater kate winslett young lady belonging to society upper class boards the titanic for the ship first atlantic crossing from southampton england to new york she is engaged to cal hockley billy zane an heir to old money and snob in every sense of the word on board rose feels the stifling trappings of high society expectations and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic stern but is saved from her self proclaimed fate by jack dawson leonardo dicaprio passenger in third class steerage as it referred to who talks her out of jumping although for rose the attraction is not immediate love affair soon develops between the two which endangers rose social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal the story sounds very simple and perhaps even unexciting but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron good movie comes through dicaprio is marvelous as the young but worldly wise jack playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors his is character that is immediately likable as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle variety of situations girls are going to swoon over him winslet also proves herself good actress delivering her lines convincingly and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character upbringing simply by judgment of her gait was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper crust debutante rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess she sometimes looks positively clumsy and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal since he has certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him his features are such that even when he smiles there something mistrustful about him and when he scowls he is evil incarnate he something like porcelain version of peter gallagher but cheaper model like dicaprio and winslet zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy cal personal assistant or man as they said at the turn of the century no matter who else is in the cast you can always count on good performance by warner who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with gaze of steel and will to match additionally there are number of smaller fictional and non fictional roles thrown in for color such as kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown danny nucci as jack friend fabrizio de rossi eric braeden as john jacob astor and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie nice to see dr bombay getting work also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die this by itself may have been largely compulsory in film about the titanic but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else in this way titanic possesses depth not usually found in action pictures you don just get love story with tragedy as backdrop but very real account of class struggle as well as mentioned before the budget for this film was tremendous and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic with regard to the exteriors would dare anyone to point out film in which vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such scale cameron actually built scale model of the titanic in water tank but only had room for 90% and therefore had to computer generate the remaining 40 feet could ve fooled me and everyone else in the theater as the splicing is seamless also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship how the flooding occurred the way the ship sank and why it did so in that manner these technical details serve as guide for later on when the action starts happening and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion in all james cameron titanic is good blend of love story history and action the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer attention is held alternately by those three main elements from the movie intriguing beginning to it satisfactory ending in box office receipts titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship
vampire films as well as other horror films are usually dumb and predictable movies meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks it is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning but has also plot worth making movies about based on anne rice novel interview with vampire is long dark trip to hell the film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of present day san francisco the camera slowly find particular window shape of young man is visible in the darkness so you want me to tell you the story of my life the mysterious man is louis brad pitt two century old vampire telling his story to fascinated interviewer christian slater his tale opens in 1791 louisiana just south of new orleans where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat tom cruise given choice between death and eternal life as one of the undead louis chooses the latter decision he will forever regret everlasting life and eternal youth promised to him by lestat turn instead into never ending suffering damned to eternal hunger for blood and longing for peace louis cannot kill with the impunity of lestat but to sate his hunger he must feed and the blood of animals is not enough eventually he pierces the neck of grief stricken young girl named claudia kirsten dunst whom lestat then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be surrogate daughter to both himself and louis for while they are one big happy family but all things end and claudia growing resentment of lestat fuels bloody confrontation when luis and claudia break loose from lestat they travel to paris where the euro vamps santiago stephen rea and armand antonio banderas who introduced them to bigger world of the damned director neil jordan the crying game together with the talented director of cinematography philippe rousselot and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere as the film begins there is an incredible palette of colors beautiful sunrises lush golden fields green forests inky blue clouds and blending sun when luis is born to darkness everything suddenly changes to dark velvet lit only by the silver moonlight the beautiful production design by dante ferretti wonderful costumes and art direction by malcolm middleton re create the multiple historical periods in the film from the renaissance new orleans and the beautiful rococo paris of the 18th century to our present days the casting is likewise good involving some of the most famous and beautiful stars of hollywood ireland and spain the controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective cruise is energetic sinister charismatic wild and bloodthirsty cruise lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark kirmizi sustenance with alarming swiftness the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror as his murderous purpose becomes clear kill them mercifully but do it you are what you are for do not doubt you are killer that is how lestat is teaching luis but behind that furious facade is anger and loneliness that he carries through the centuries and tries to smother with nightly rampages brad pitt is equally convincing as the vampire with human soul antonio banderas and stephen rea are effective but since they play more or less secondary characters their performances are almost invisible the greatest performance in the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst who manages to create an incredibly emotional and believable character the world is changing around the little child but she does not she remains unchangeable child for all eternity only her wise dark eyes reveal her age ironically the film only miss is the script anne rice novel is very interesting read and her script is rich colorful and emotional but it is also tiering and too melancholic at times resembling soap opera claudia is that what should do let you go my father my luis who made me who will look after me my dark angel when you are gone luis everything will be alright claudia do you really believe that and then they hug emotionally moments like those displayed above and luis self pity is bit tiresome however rice script is otherwise strong and well structured bringing up humor and comic episodes that were more or less hidden in the book when lestat finds claudia dead dressmaker whom she has killed he cries out who will make you that dress now be little practical never in the house moments like that are both entertaining and appealing neil jordan direction is beautiful and sensual as he plays with interesting issues like eternity homosexuality love and loneliness his gothic saga is not meant to scare but to display these issues differently wrapped up in mystery his new original picture brings vampire films to new height
love is the devil is challenging film munundating its audience with wild imagery and plot structure that disallows plot perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist psyche rather than the artist lifeline watching it was enthralled with the look of the film the way the director shot everything like it was looking through bizarre personalized filter everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon the film subject looked at it personally but while was engrossed stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film awakened from my trance by some inner distraction and began to try and follow what going on exactly what was looking at watching this film wasn sure if it was the most insightful film had ever seen or the most vacuous directed and written by john maybury love is the devil is stylish masterpiece for the senses everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing the camera angles are ferociously askew and the close ups are uncomfortably too close the editing is deft occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds but other times holding on shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs or rather intruders to bacon world and psyche as such there is no real story ve not heard much about francis bacon that didn read prior to the film but what learned was this he was painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like he was one of the first to really come out of the closet and in interviews he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi he like foppish and self absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero he lives life the way he wants to live it to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him it as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself champagne for my real friends and pain for my sham friends he says one night at the bar he frequents love is the devil chronicles the latter part of his life bacon well known in his mid life awakens one night when he hears man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor he walks in unafraid of what he finds and discovers thief george dyer daniel craig bacon gives him an offer if he spends the night with him he can take anything he wants in the morning george agrees to this and off to bed he goes but ends up staying with him for whatever reason the film shows their lives together at least in reference to one another while creating bacon world of friends like high art this film minors in showing certain group of people who radiate connection that is not shown but is understood the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant bacon is haughty and bizarre george is simple and doesn understand bacon in the least especially not his paintings while watching this that basically all thought was there the film has hypnotic feel free of any restraints of form and is shot so uniquely that felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about once the film is over it easier to piece it together kept on thinking about this film wondering what the point to all of it was someone doesn merely make film of all style and no substance at all and if they do they do it by accident but still allow some substance to creep in thinking about it remembered how the two fed off of eachother thought about how bacon was masochist in love with cruelty in one scene he watches boxing match with orgiastic delight and lets out squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer head splashes across his face in another scene he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein battleship potemkin and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain he drove him over the edge and for him that was love even if it wasn for george guess that explains the title bit that great and all but almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning wish it hadn reduced itself to making some point about humanity about how love is the most selfish thing in the world and it is if you look at it certain way or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man twisted pysche it almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience throat that way you don reduce your film to something it just not can say totally enjoyed love is the devil though despite all of the things respect about this movie it still rather uncomfortable to sit through even at normally trite length of ninety minutes the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through especially after an exhausting first hour though hypnotic it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times as if it were taking advantage of one man truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it as such respect the way the film looks it beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that along with what dreams may come and dark city it the year most visually stunning film in fact if better script had been forged almost compare it in visual power to peter greenaway film complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever and with dymanite performance by derek jacobi it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs just wish it had been more than mostly style and just hair bit of substance then would have had something to hold me over even now
in 1995 brian singer and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up simple concept the audience isn stupid from that they went on and created the most plot driven intricately pieced movie in the last 25 years the result the usual suspects one hell of movie that redefines the word plot twist the story is convoluted and is really confusing to read although easy to follow on screen special investigator kujan chazz palminteri grills verbal kint kevin spacey crippled con man who is the lone survivor of an la boat explosion that claimed more than 20 victims kujan wants to confirm that his nemesis the rogue cop keaton gabriel byrne is actually dead kint relates the majority of the film in flashback beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in police station lineup in new york city along with dour keaton kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus stephen baldwin mordantly sarcastic hockney kevin pollak and fenster benicio del toro whose speech is virtually incomprehensible together they plot to steal small fortune in gems from new york finest taxi service crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug kingpins what follows is shell game of violence and betrayal all hinging on the identity of mysterious villain called keyser soze the film is brilliantly compact its the shortest 90 minutes you ll ever spend in movie theater the cast is exceptional palminteri shines he is brutally honest true cop one who is going after the whole story because its there byrne is terrific his brooding character his seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro who is riot as fenster del toro is brilliant his lines are jumbled mess you can understand word the man says but it sure is damn funny baldwin is also very good he is careful methodical and cold chilling character with nasty streak of hot blooded sarcasm pollak is also terrific as usual very good character actor however this will be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey spacey is simply breathtaking he is force on screen giving magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze spacey performance will be remembered for years for it is the best of his career it may be the best supporting actor performance in the last 50 years verbal kint is clever storyteller weak oppressed and gleefully evil to the bone yet pitiful one who draws sympathy the film is good one decent film until the last 10 minutes what this film boils down to is the greatest ending in cinematic history for me at least the revelation of keyser soze the closing gunfights it is something wondrous you have to see this movie about 10 times to believe what they do kudos to mcquarrie and singer for giving the audience delightful fast paced furiously plot driven movie with quirky characters phenomenal acting and some hilarious moments stuck in the middle mcquarrie refuses to believe the audience is dumb without furnishing too many details he concocts his story and lets it run hoping the audience gets it at the end we do this might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created kudos also to singer and john ottman who created the score they both create what is true film noir setting carefully setting up this intricate puzzle until the final jarring ending there are flaws more questions raised than answers lack of character development and no strong female characters save one however the plot and that stunning ending make up for all the flaws and more if you haven seen the movie rent it watch it then rewind the tape and watch it again trust me you ll be amazed
the thought provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of leila powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui that is his first motion picture in prosperous thirty year career to gain distribution thanks to first run features although unfamiliar with mehrjui previous directing efforts perhaps the reason for this is that while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers set in modern day iran leila begins on the birthday of the title character leila hatami after brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband reza ali mosaffa as leila and reza set off to visit his parents and then hers where birthday celebration has been planned things seem rosy for the couple on the outside but for leila life isn quite as sweet earlier on that very same day leila had gone to see her physician and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving child when all of the conditions are ruled out and leila passes up the possibility of adoption reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her and doesn care at all about having children nonetheless leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him baby which is the societal norm and her self esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother in law jamileh sheikhi whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news reza is her only son bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and in country where polygamy is an accepted tradition she suggests that he take second wife to bear child with leila hesitantly agrees and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens inadequacies reza finally does meet woman whom he claims to like even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn give her full blessing there are no easy answers to be found within leila film that thoughtfully examines the central character unfortunate plight as well as the inner workings of leila herself told through matter of fact narration almost completely taken over by her own shame she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother in law requests even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman maybe because leila is from iran the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as more or less everyday occurrence leila however is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy no matter what the circumstances one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza who married only three months after their first meeting but obviously love each other very deeply it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible although seemingly unimportant at first glance an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing nearly uncontrollably actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila large stuffed animal for her birthday and then reveals beautiful necklace he has also gotten her these small moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn outraging sequences in the latter half in which reza drops leila off at the side of busy road and then zooms off to go on date with another woman left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage foolishly unbeknownst to reza leila prays each time that the date will not go well so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for little while longer refusing to stay over at her parent house the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman and in sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below despite her initial agreement to such thing leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him sure the whole second marriage was his mother idea but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children then he could have still easily backed out couldn he in the pivotal role of leila who appears in every scene leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength unavoidable vulnerability and utter despair unlike most american films in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words every bit perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa as reza man who believe does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else for all of its strong aspects leila isn perfect film on technical level found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed and concerning the plot developments the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before mehrjui decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother in law played memorably by jamileh sheikhi despite these minor missteps leila is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york cinema village and then on may 21 in la the thought provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales and when the climax arrives leila self worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal victim led into complete devastation to which there is no return it difficult to not consider how leila culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided had the other characters taken second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme was going through
barely scrapping by playing at nyc piano bar timothy hutton returns to his massachusetts hometown for couple of weeks on the surface he coming home for high school reunion but since this is movie you know that he really looking for some major life decisions fairly small film this sports an impressive ensemble cast including uma thurman rosie donnell and bunch of actors that you ve seen before but can quite place commendable jobs all around they seem like real people hutton arrives at his past and is greeted by his spirit dead father terminally goony brother and old high school chums all of his old buddies are engaged in the snow removal business and most are in the midst of relationship crisis the perfect stuff for comedy about people in the twenties angst he meets and falls for the new next door neighbor beautiful intelligent lively girl who is obviously taken with him the problem is that she is only 13 unconsummated no it not _that_ type of movie their relationship builds and neither knows what to do with it star crossed lovers with no where to go so hutton is gaga over barely teen one of his buddies is two timing his girlfriend with married old flame another girlfriend is sleeping with meat cutter and she vegetarian things are mess enter uma thurman the beautiful stranger in town for few days is both delight in the film and one of its minor downfalls her character is fun to watch even more entertaining is observing the guys falling over themselves trying to impress her like the lone ranger before she leaves she solves most of the problems and sets everyone onward with their lives the ending is bit too pat everything is tied up with neat little bow rosie donnell is stand out in her limited screen time with her brash personality and tell it like it is pronouncements structured somewhat like diner few years later this feel good story is good time but ends little too nice

this summer one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham series time to kill was made into major motion picture on january of this year director rob reiner basically re released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi based on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars assassination ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25 year legal battle faced by myrlie evars whoopi goldberg sister act and her quest to have her husband obvious assassin and racist byron de la beckwith james woods casino jailed so she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter alec baldwin heaven prisoners to imprison the former kkk member ghosts sets its tone with an opening montage of images from african american history from slave ship miseries to life in the racist south of the 1960 but all too soon the beyaz folks take over intoning lines like what america got to do with anything this is mississippi as beckwith james woods with his head larded with latex most of the time as an old man teeters between portraying evil and its character meanwhile goldberg turns in very serious and weepy performance as the wife who wouldn let her husband death rest until she got the conviction both deserve serious oscar consideration this brings us to the dull performance of baldwin let face it trying to match matthew mcconaughey wonderful acting in time to kill is basically impossible and baldwin is living proof of this as no emotions could be felt it seemed as if he actually had to struggle to shed single tear either poor acting or poor directing but something definitely went wrong another strange mishap was the fact that goldberg facial features didn change as she looked the same in the courtroom as she did holding her husband dead body 25 years earlier yet woods was plastered with enough make up to make him look like goldberg father at least the make up was realistic with some emotional moments in the poorly written script ghosts of mississippi lacked in heart when its predecessor time to kill brought tears to everyone eyes don get me wrong the movie wasn all that bad but if you ve seen grisham masterpiece then don expect this one to be an excellent film
krippendorf tribe is formula comedy done poorly formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema however every now and then one emerges like krippendorf tribe that actually works professor james krippendorf richard dreyfuss the renowned anthropologist is in trouble his university gave him hefty grant to discover lost tribe in new guinea however he found nothing his wife has recently died and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids shelly natasha lyonne mickey gregory smith and edmund carl michael lidner tonight he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe rather than break the news and face the consequences of misusing his funds he invents tribe the shelmikedmu named after his kids however one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu but his research becomes popular phenomenon soon professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over eager colleague veronica micelli jenna elfman and the intense scrutiny of rival anthropologist ruth allen lily tomlin krippendorf tribe does seem to require little suspension of disbelief no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly mavi eyes luckily as the film builds momentum that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by though there some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as lost tribe the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable and the comic timing required for some of the film latter scenes is superb richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe jenna elfman position as romantic lead seems bit forced at times but she plays the part with extreme affability even the kids who in films like this tend to be bit on the precocious side are endearing and humorous yes the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor but it has the best excuse of all it funny it may not go down as an all time classic but it certainly delivers what you expect from comedy plenty of laughs
sick the life and death of bob flanagan supermasochist by fernando vallejo starring bob flanagan and sheree rose interviews by kathe burkhart kirby dick and rita valencia produced and directed by kirby dick running time 90 mins this film is not rated the central themes of sick the life and death of bob flanagan supermasochist are pain and love and its subsequent effect on person life its protagonist bob flanagan who died at the age of 52 suffered from cystic fibrosis mortal disease which debilitates the lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus preventing him from normal breathing the movie is about much more than recouperating or attempting to from this disease an audacious fabulously triumphant docudrama sick chronicles the life of flanagan and his vicious unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his mistress of 15 years sheree rose who amazingly provided much of the footage for the film flanagan idelogy crosses the realms of rebelliousness and becomes transcendental similar to terry zwigoff brilliant 1994 crumb which also explored the dysfunction of an artist by painting not sympathetic portrait but realistic one both crumb and flanagan revelled in their defects but flanagan was not only man content on enduring the pain via lungs he inflicted acts of pain on himself at very young age courageously defying god he was an irish catholic and turning his body into work of art which he unraveled in museums and lectures behold these works of physical art among them is metal ball inserted inside his anus and the most disturbing scene of the decade nailing his penis to board flanagan was man of great intelligence wit and humor as well as adopting sense of candidness scarcely seen in modern filmmaking not only did he approach his disease with humor peforming burlesque acts in front of an audience he was also revitalized by his approachment most with cystic fibrosis do not make it past their earlier twenties there also subplot involving female devotee who knew death was awaiting her but the most outstanding thing about sick is flanagan relationship with sheree brimming with honesty sensual stimulation and unapologetically sad moments of pain their powerful bond lifts sick into rare cinematic high where we forget we are in an auditorium and become part of these people the last scene where we see the hero murmuring the last words to his wife in hospital bed as he struggles for his last moments of life is raw tender hideous it goes step beyond cinematic intimacy
before even seeing single frame of the film it would be easy to snicker at deep impact in which comet on collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet it is the latest entry in this decade dubious revival of the 70s disaster film and the first of two the sky is falling flicks to hit screens this year the other being this coming july armageddon in which meteor is the threat its tagline oceans rise cities fall hope survives is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight they came in alone the only way out is together but it every bit as treacly the opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at the cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions such as the usual opening roll call in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced the most prominent of the personal stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner tea leoni who is distraught that her father maximilian schell left her mother vanessa redgrave for younger woman rya kihlstedt what is just as snicker worthy is how this co venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high profile corporate collaboration microsoft and nbc cable news network msnbc which employs jenny who is the film ostensible main character in the vision of america presented here msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home when in reality it only reaches fraction of the country the initial signs point toward something along the lines of volcano or dante peak but there one thing about deep impact underestimated the skills of director mimi leder she won an emmy for her helming work on nbc smash er which is essentially weekly disaster movie each episode featuring new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises the challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold to make the audience care for these guest characters regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are and powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy handed or overly melodramatic having passed the er challenge in numerous episodes and showed flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker leder could not be better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen as the countdown to impact progresses the ominous feeling of doom is palpable leading the final act to take on surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension there nothing here that will profoundly move anyone but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in genre generally more concerned with effects situations that initially feel contrived such as jenny familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner leelee sobieski and comet discoverer leo biederman elijah wood achieve some poignance and even the more vaguely drawn characters including president tom beck morgan freeman astronaut spurgeon fish tanner robert duvall and his rather faceless crew ron eldard jon favreau mary mccormack blair underwood and alexander baluyev aboard the comet bombing spacecraft messiah have their share of touching moments the latter fact owes debt to the actors who all do solid job and are well cast with the possible exception of leoni she delivers decent performance but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as star news broadcaster although its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister it is the first of the 90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true film that makes genuine impact even if it isn as deep as hoped
synopsis private detective tom welles is hired by wealthy widow to uncover the origins of snuff film owned by her late husband after uncovering the authenticity of the film welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers comments mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies have seen in long time though it doesn present snuff film movie which documents person murder for real usually during or after some form of sexual act as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as say natural born killers mm stays in your head long after you see it it is not fun to watch see something else if you get upset by realistic sadistic violence this film violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc 17 territory for those with strong stomachs however mm is an intelligent worthwhile thriller especially during its second hour nicolas cage after couple ho hum movies returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities as tom welles private detective and caring family man to wife and newly born daughter cage skillfully and convincingly portrays decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants serving as guide to this world is joaquin phoenix who plays struggling songwriter named max california california despite his name is surprisingly intelligent and complex character and phoenix does very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character the real star of the movie though must be peter stormare stormare played the really really evil guy in fargo and his character dino velvet in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable his performance is very chilling mm success may hardly be surprising it was directed by joel schumacher who hopefully saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin before directing the last two batman duds however schumacher was responsible for several well made horror flicks lost boys flatliners and falling down mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who self destructs before the audience eyes mm was written by andrew kevin walker who also penned the academy award winning thriller seven few years back like seven mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater welles is searching for answers how could anyone possibly drug and then slowly methodically sadistically kill teenaged girl to make film when confronting one of the perpretrators at the end the murderer responds that there are no reasons he just enjoys it that walker seems to suggest is where the real terror lays not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist couple minor faults led me to my four star rating five stars is the highest rating give one found it little difficult early on to accept the fact that hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing snuff film yes snuff is horrible thing but detective of welles caliber has probably encountered awful things before second some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient he discovers for example the victim diary in her private bathroom despite the fact the the police the fbi and her own mother have all investigated the room before finally the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film despite the above criticisms mm is an engrossing story one of the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as crazed welles who no longer seems like hero brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film he pulls gun on the man and for relatively long amount of time struggles to decide whether or not to kill him he then leaves the building and calls the victim mother in the middle of the night to basically see if she would support the action the entire scene is tense unpredictable and emotionally charged rarely anymore do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as mm with scenes like this did mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart this is graphic oftentimes unflinching look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary and extraordinary people if you re prepared for film of this nature give it an enthusiastic recommendation

it stands as moment one will not soon forget giant green ogre flips through the pages of cliche fairy tale narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek dreamworks second computer animated feature but in pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema page of this tale serves as that ogre toilet paper from this opening moment one can infer shrek defying of all expectations regarding it as standard disney esque fairy tale although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship courage and acceptance excelled by outstanding direction stunning actor voice work and most importantly witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline shrek the previously mentioned ogre holds position of absolute nothingness within his community the jolly green giant meets fellow outsider known only as the donkey his species who talks and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for good portion of time shrek eventually comes to mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from castle guarded by dragon for the powerful lord farquaad learning quite bit about each other and themselves along the way their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines along the journey to rescue fiona donkey immeasurable cowardice reveals itself whether he encounters walking over shaky bridge or living alone donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self acknowledgment but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant fire breathing dragon guarding fiona either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him allowing the donkey to overcome horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them secondly upon shrek and donkey redeeming of princess fiona the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her to satisfy her desire for human knight in shining armor throughout this storyline shrek faces his deep perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth but eventually shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it if one sets his her mind to overcoming something in particular endless possibilities exist after the friendships and courage prevail the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development acceptance surprisingly fiona holds dark secret of her own due to spell cast upon her years ago she transforms into an ogre by night in this storyline fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself and she must realize what beauty truly means to simply act as one self upon fiona learning of shrek desire to pursue relationship with her fiona knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work gives in to her inner demons of self ridicule and hatred any child can pull from fiona transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self acceptance on the technical side shrek triumphs directors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in consistent and satisfying manner evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers shrek eddie murphy donkey and cameron diaz princess fiona myers creates his shrek as lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as skin color but perhaps his envy of other normal beings murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona giving the princess ogre sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack while the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay written by ted elliott terry rossio joe stillman and roger schulman the script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike capping it off with constant tongue in cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers with shrek dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come the smaller children will laugh and cheer the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not film that breaks stereotypes and creates definite standard of its own shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages

in `enemy at the gates jude law is gifted russian sniper made hero by political officer named danilov joseph fiennes who uses him in propaganda newspaper to raise the hopes of the soldiers and people of stalingrad it world war ii and the russian german standoff in town could determine the outcome of things for the motherland law vassili is the russian top pawn to victory lots of war stuff happens an older german version of jude character played by ed harris shows up halfway into the proceedings he equally talented and the two men play cat and mouse game trying to kill each other they constantly switch roles as the war fades far into the background the cast also includes the terrific rachel weisz as love interest for both vassili and danilov the set up is decent and so are the production values boasting wide range of grimy locales greasy hair and tattered costumes the art direction prospers the actors however suffer the problem matt damon had in `saving private ryan either their eyes teeth skin or combination of other features looked too beyaz and clean with dirt and blood all around the blinding teeth or bright eyes of these actors divert attention from the action that said the players are mostly good in their roles although don think ed harris was really trying maybe he realized his role struck difficult chord in one notedom while the film is technically about snipers there are far too many predictable sniping scenes director jean jacques annaud expects us to view each tense situation with jude and some cohort in tight spot as edgy and exciting but after about the sixth time in which we realize that jude is not going to die it relatively pointless we get that he talented okay let move on that the problem with `enemy at the gates it just doesn know when to stop witness the wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere reestablishing his title as the most beautiful and often talented man on film jude law carries the movie without him this costly production would have gone into the ground the story and acting are of good quality but there never sense of authenticity or reality something about this war movie is undeniably modern and it loses its feeling strange enough the screenplay is based on the true story of real russian sniper
it been good long while since we had good old fashioned thriller where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters but it been even longer since saw thriller that actually shock cared for the characters not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles flaws and strengths to emerge so radiantly saw that it been at least couple decades even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers though hardly comparing simple plan to say rear window or strangers on train yet it almost as good it simple yet strangely complex and astonishingly rewarding because instead of moving from plot point to plot point and merely laying out they might be caught overtones it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral elegantly directed by sam raimi yes the same simple plan concerns itself with the discovery of crashed plane and within bag full of millions of dollars by an upright moderately financially stable working man bill paxton his dim witted brother billy bob thornton and his drinking buddy brent briscoe without anyone around and the possibility that no one would come looking for it the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes they will keep it but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking and so they generally don flaunt anything they don want to flaunt they ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities they could try to fight off the rightful owners who are either villainous or just or they could fight amongst themselves simple plan though borrows little from each of these little tiff with the cops here subplot involving an alleged fbi agent chilling gary cole there and bit of inside feuding over here but as austin powers would say that not necessarily its bag baby what most admired about this film and what makes this far superior and unique thriller is that it successfully able to have its cake and eat it too it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches like the ones mentioned above but at the same time it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in siyah duffle bag so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up and these subsequent steps go miserably awry the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity in one early scene paxton and thornton have to make trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn look like it was all stolen not bad idea when thornton screws up as he does continuously throughout the movie and paxton has to do some major covering up read homicide instead of quick murder and immeadiate hands washing raimi shows lengthy painful shot from low angle onto paxton face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach conclusion there similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective but the previous shot is even better more morally complex and more gut wrenching in short probably the best piece of direction raimi ever done demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results for further proof watch persona sex scene and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman ever done but the film hardly stops here it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof yet it also moves from step to step in such graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical with aid from his pregnant wife played by bridget fonda pal to raimi he does and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights there at least two grand shootouts and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history and when they arrive they don come with masochistic delight but with cringe inducing horror during the one was actually sinking into my chair with the mantra they can do this can they streeming through my head in fact this film which is getting many comparisons to the coen [superior but forget about it] fargo has many similar moments of manic insanity attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what in other hands would be over the top distractedness imagine suppose robert rodriguez directing this then again after seeing the evil dead films hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed raimi moments rifle shot notwithstanding instead raimi directs with maturity and gentle touch easily letting the story and characters co exist while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out like some offbeat comic touches most particularly billy bob thornton character jacob is brilliant creation his dim wittedness is often hilarious for most of the film every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter but there authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we re not totally laughing at him the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full condescension because thornton is so damn real jacob multi dimensional character and while being stupid we see that as not so much flaw but strength to his character his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of strong inner strength and belief system primarily towards the middle where his bud and co conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money the final third of the film spends much time with him and many of the touches upon his character not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott smith adapting his own book by the way are just great particularly admired back story about an old high school girlfriend told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near sweetness and further strength of his saddened character thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance by far the best performance he ever given and further proof that he the best character actor in contemporary cinema if you don believe me go back and watch his wonderful performance in primary colors performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn been in the same year because he easily able to slip into character and make him completely and utterly believable he brings so much weight to the film that as it is with most character actors it difficult picturing anyone else in the role the rest of the cast is great too from paxton declining working man to chelcie ross amiable town sheriff even fonda shows off her talents nicely and if had any complaints about the film it that the plot is almost too simplistic and that at times it seems too much like an exercise like cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved and the occasional narration is as it usually is annoying narration should be used with extreme caution especially when you re trying to set things up and or express emotions didn raimi watch the first murder scene and the thing that can most usually go wrong with movie the ending is basically amiss won reveal it but it way too cruel and too much of an outsider set up as if the appearance of plane wasn already too much of that anyway for film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved this is the wrong ending imagine character controlled ending otherwise it like if in crime and punishment if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing not that at all comparing simple plan to dostoevsky the ending does work despite my protestations but to me there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it but if you had no qualms and were happy as clam with it then just ignore me and go about your day but despite my mere claims make no mistake that was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured not because of any kind of gore factor which is thankfully for this very minimal but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile at least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece
the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics loved by the people and make tons of money at the box office this year the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic the mummy have always been sucker for this kind of monster movies and always seem to be the only critic who really likes them that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza in the mummy the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick connell he teams up with curious clumsy librarian named evelyn played by rachel weisz to find the mysterious city of the dead hamunaptra evelyn loves egypt and would truly like to visit the city that people call fable rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during battle and that why she chose him to lead her there also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn brother jonathan played by john hannah sliding doors now in hamunaptra the three uncover the book of the dead the curious evelyn unlocks the book reads from it and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep arnold vosloo becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book along with imhotep arising from the dead the ten curses of egypt become in full effect launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt don expect huge things out of the mummy but just expect to have good time this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects which may turn off some viewers on the other hand this type of film is one of my favorites but that up to you to decide there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though the state of the art special effects take you into completely different world we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert swarms of beetles and locusts and even creatures crawling under human skin these may have been in other movies before but not like in the mummy as of now the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year but all this could change when star wars episode the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country in the past brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles when playing george in disney george of the jungle he was mainly not known by anyone would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him name and now the mummy will give him name amongst teens in the mummy fraser gets to play an action hero and liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle although brendan fraser is great rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast weisz really reminded me of character from an old horror film the way she acts looked and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time evelyn is probably the only character that was likable considering that the other characters like john hannah didn get much personal attention in many films when different genres are mixed the mixing usually works and like it for the most part in the mummy though not all of the mixing works there are some scenes that have lot of potential horror some with potential comedy some with potential drama and some with potential pure action but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work the mummy could have gotten an rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these didn mind the corny one liners here and there during action sequences but it certainly could have done without them the cinematography is amazing in the mummy particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt we are taken into very fun portrayal of egypt mummies and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians the costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits the costumes are always top notch the bottom line with the mummy the summer is off to its usually great start
jacques tati 1953 classic les vacances de hulot also known as mr hulot vacation in english ought to be the textbook on how to do non dialogue comedy in film the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly and the film operates on the paper thin premise that monsieur hulot played by tati himself is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking week vacation yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy but think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face first into pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don watch where they re going in les vacances de hulot the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low key in one sequence for example hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when while his back is turned the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves washes away then comes back up on the other side of the boat while crossing over to get the can hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it when he actually takes the boat out into the water it breaks in half but the two halves flip up against each other trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for shark fin and panic on the beach ensues tati doesn waste single opportunity for humor scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience expectations and les vacances de hulot succeeds brilliantly in that area as well tati accomplishes this largely through sort of deadpan understatement when hulot goes into separate room during dinner and starts playing record at defeaningly loud volume no fights or shouting matches ensue instead the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room disconnecting the record player and leaving puzzled hulot sitting in the dark tati also uses running gags to this effect allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would more often than not we can see them coming and think oh he not going to do that again but lo and behold he does for example there is recurring joke in which hulot noisy sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel lights coming on one by one then this image turns up again in the finale which will not give away other than to say that involves lot more noise in the middle of the night than car engine could ever produce the ending is one of two elements that really make this four star film as opposed to merely an above average clever comedy as much as was laughing during this film was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as complete viewing experience suffice it to say that he did the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him alternatively it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons instead tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them however strange or irritating they might seem les vacances de hulot is not subtitled but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events anyone with taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store note les vacances de hulot was not rated by the mpaa it would at most receive pg rating
bruce willis stars as malcolm an award winning child psychologist who discovers one night that one of his former patients is still suffering from inner demons the now grown man breaks into his apartment while he and his wife olivia williams from rushmore are celebrating his award shoots malcolm in the stomach then takes his own life almost nine months later malcolm discovers cole haley joel osment in brilliant performance another young man afflicted with the same turmoil as his former patient he takes on the child case in the hope of redeeming himself for botching up the previous one alienating his wife in the process he soon discovers that they boy can see and speak to the dead and his life becomes forever turned upside down although the first hour is very slow the sixth sense turns out to be very powerful and moving film was expecting this film to be mercury rising but was astonished to discover an extremely well plotted out little thriller with an outstandingly satisfying ending you ll find yourself mentally retracing your steps through the film to see if you actually saw what you think you did once the credits roll must give night shyamalan lot of credit for brilliantly written screenplay the cast should also be given lot of credit for making the movie as solid as it is lesser cast could have made this film joke bruce willis portrays his character perfectly balancing his need to help cole and his agony over his strained relationship with his wife skillfully haley joel osment shines as nine year old cole showing patience in his character that few young actors these days can pull off toni collette looking markedly different from her pathetic character in muriel wedding gives strong performance as cole mother who is trying to cope with both her son illness and the passing of her mother finally olivia williams deftly portrays woman having to struggle with husband who not around and flirtations with co worker that could lead to begrudgingly accepted end it shame that they show cole abilities in the trailer because the movie takes close to forty minutes to get around to doing the same so we already know what going on before most of the rest of the cast does in retrospect though the forty minute set up is essential to enjoying the end of the film so have fewer complaints now then did while was watching the film glad that the run of teen styled horror films has passed and filmmakers are starting to make more adult fare films like this the similarly themed stir of echoes and countless others to be released later in the year should make for pretty entertaining close to 1999 [pg 13]
when first heard that disney next animated feature was going to be tarzan was almost horrified was worried that disney was going to make another hercules sorry jerk ules that effort was too overloaded with comedy and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered sympathetic hero and after viewing it to this day find it disgrace for disney animation when saw the trailers was thinking hmm this isn bad at all this just might have potential when bought the soundtrack was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features have never really heard of phil collins nor have heard of mark mancina so was wondering how would these two make this disney flick spin was pleasantly surprised the music is top notch phil collins songs are terrific percussion heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs the score from mark mancina was also neat it reminded me bit of the lion king but it was more original so the soundtrack wasn bad at all considering it was by two people am not familiar with this film could be good but will it be when finally went to see it on opening day as tend to do with most disney animated features my question was answered in complete turnabout of expectations for me disney tarzan is surprisingly decent the story starts out with tarzan parents surviving shipwreck and finding home on an island where apes live in peace however one day vicious leopard sabor attacks and kills tarzan parents leaving him at this time baby alone until kala of the apes rescues him kala wants to raise the child as her own she lost hers previously to sabor but her mate kerchak is not too sure it not our kind he says he agrees though to let her take care of little tarzan but that doesn make him my son tarzan grows up vowing to be the best ape ever but no matter how hard he tries or what he does at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend terk he just can convince kerchak that he is one of the apes even when he defeats sabor in battle one day new animal shows up humans this is where jane comes into the picture she is on an expedition with her father professor porter and despicable hunter clayton searching for gorillas tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons and soon they get to know each other even though tarzan falls in love with jane this causes things to go wrong clayton tricks tarzan into taking him jane and porter to see the apes who are convinced that he has betrayed them worse clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money will tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes not gonna tell you sorry you re gonna have to see for yourself and see it you should the animation is as always top notch particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees read that skateboarding the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in in fact it seems similar to the computer imagery cel animation combination in rival disney animted films such as fox anastasia and dreamworks prince of egypt could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals the casting is fairly good tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan and to my relief the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules nicely done and glenn close is wonderful as kala she has beautiful singing voice too by the way lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson beast voice which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping minnie driver had me little worried at first as the voice of jane thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film when first saw the trailers but when saw the film didn have problem with her take back my insult on driver it nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for disney animated feature he was fflewdurr flamm in disney most underrated classic the siyah cauldron he is funny and delightful as professor porter on the villiany side of the voices brian blessed the guy who did boss nass in star wars episode the phantom menace brings pompous and later on vicious voice to the sinister clayton he might not be the strongest character in the film he just plain bad guy nothing else but blessed vocal work contributes greatly but if there is any voice that think steals the whole show it should be rosie donnell who is hilariously funny as terk she also has fiesty attitude gonna kill ya she says more than once almost sung along with her during one of the film best moments where the apes make mess of the human camp via song er scatting shoo be doo da be dah can see why she wanted to have rock song for the film she good singer not that she was the only funny character in the film though wayne knight who played stan in space jam gives whimsically funny style to tantor an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into un sanitary water thankfully there is no real sound of flatuence that would have killed the picture the songs as said before are decent mostly sung by collins this sets new standard for disney animated films because for the first time the characters do not sing tolerate musical numbers from characters lot more than some other guys would but found this to be nice change of pace the story does have elements of comedy in it but they also load it with strong dramatic touches which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules if there is anything disappointing about tarzan it might be the omission of the sync version of trashing the camp from the film heard it on the soundtrack and wondered where it was going to be was upset that it wasn because had thought of taking few friends of mine who like sync to see tarzan oh well overall was enthralled with tarzan wouldn hold it high the way do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame my all time favorite disney classics but this film deserves high place among disney greatest achievements give nod to disney for following up their spectacular masterpiece mulan with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough tarzan
whenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two blockbuster films the end result is always mess of script acting directing and generally waste of time for any audience with an average iq above 40 the latest movie morass from hollywood the crew appeared equally destined to fail strange combination of grumpy old men and goodfellas tossed together with the likes of richard dreyfuss and burt reynolds helming the ship the scary thing is that it actually entertaining and breath of fresh air in this otherwise stale month the crew works for several reasons the clever script is reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie following four past their prime wiseguys from jersey who now live in the raj mahal apartment house in miami beach the wiseguys find themselves being evicted from their golden paradise by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach bunnies and boys looking for beachfront property the four mobsters bobby bartellemeo richard dreyfuss joey bats pistella burt reynolds mike the brick donatelli dan hedaya and tony mouth donato seymour cassel decide to hatch scheme to plant there dead body heisted from the morgue in order to drive out the new tenants and keep their home this simple plan suddenly goes screwy of course and the boys become involved with stripper named ferris jennifer tilly who wants her stepmother killed paranoid latin drug lord who convinced mysterious rival is out to get him and rat with its tail on fire the crew works as strong comedic vehicle driven by great ensemble cast of talented character actors and subtle leading men instead of concentrating on bobby search for his daughter the film gives equal screen time to all four wiseguys balancing the production the acting talents of such screen veterans as dan hedaya seymour cassel and the great great burt reynolds are brought out by each character uniqueness and synergy within the wiseguy circle strong supporting cast including jeremy piven as philandering boyfriend cop partner and miguel sandoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs the film was produced by barry sonnenfeld and carries hint get shorty with its energetic camera work by michael dinner emmy award winning director of the wonder years the quick script written by barry fanaro screenwriter of kingpin is carried by plenty of subtly dry humor and wit the crew is prime example of how simple and dry witted comedy can get these days the great thing is that this comedy does not need to be punctuated by bodily fluids phallus symbols in the head or grandmothers giving head in spa in the steady flow of extreme comedy these days flowing from hollywood like broken water main it the elder statesmen like dreyfuss reynolds and hedaya that can carry comic arc with only few weapons of choice decent script and good acting
in my reviews try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see realize that we all have different tastes and cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike but in the case of american beauty must make an exception if you haven yet seen it go see it now stop reading this review and head for your local multiplex then after you ve seen it come back ll wait here welcome back if you followed my advice and see no reason why you should not have do you sure you ve just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life american beauty is an extraordinary film powerful jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream it humorous but it isn funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production mixing comedy and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended and by god it works making it one of the year very best lester burnham kevin spacey has entered the mother of all mid life crises he is living life without purpose he is bored depressed and sick of his sheltered insignificant existence he barely ever talks to his family has no sex life is stuck at dead end job and thinks he has no reason to live but one day when he and his equally troubled wife annette bening attend one of his daughter thora birch cheerleading performances he sees something that makes him come alive what he sees is the performance by his daughter friend the head cheerleader he develops lust for the promiscuous young girl an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature but for the first time lester feels that he is actually living this crush is only the beginning lester proceeds to make more and more radical changes in his life buying the car of his dreams cursing off the boss and quitting his job today quit my job told the boss to himself and blackmailed him for $60 000 would you pass the asparagus please buying drugs from the voyeur next door ricky fitts teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be beauty and refusing to be docile in family affairs his new attitude further alienates his daughter only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be and inspiring her to enter relationship with her eccentric neighbor and the burnhams neighbors provide american beauty with significant chunk of its dramatic momentum ricky fitts wes bentley serves as the film thematic center providing the obscure powerful meaning of the title colonel fitts the father is one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the movie even considering his limited screentime kevin spacey has never been better and this performance will certainly earn him chance to put little altin person on his mantel he never plays his droll character as freak rather he effectively portrays him as normal person led to drastic self exploration by his dissatisfaction with life spacey is poignant and devastating in the role of lifetime equally astonishing is young thora birch who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness at two hours and ten minutes american beauty didn feel nearly long enough it complicated unforgettable film that like the ice storm two years ago dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life powerfully and cynically it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the beyaz picket fence and appealing garden being the american dream it claims that this picture perfect image is just that an image and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it the dark deeply ironic ending though given away by our narrator in the first few minutes of the movie stays with you for weeks after it all over american beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released even more so considering it masterpiece
alchemy is steeped in shades of mavi kieslowski mavi that is with its examination of death isolation character restoration and recovery from loss suzanne myers new independent film echoes the polish director internationally acclaimed 1993 release language aside the principal difference between the films is that while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character world alchemy keeps its viewers at arm length as result while we re able to appreciate the film intellectual tapestry it is emotionally distant alchemy is divided into three chapters charity faith and hope while there are common themes and story elements running through all three the single constant is the main character sculptor russian translator named louisa rya kihlstedt when the film opens she living with her painter boyfriend whom she believes to be cheating on her following his sudden death in an automobile accident louisa life is thrown into turmoil events swirls around her and she can find source of stability in her quest to make sense out of her loss she befriends her late boyfriend mistress visits her ill sister and eventually abandons her old life by joining back to nature cult alchemy successfully explores variety of compelling issues in addition to asking the basic question of how person should cope with the unexpected death of loved one it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process the meaning of love and the nature of art does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life with all of its various distractions to the fullest myers challenge is to make these subjects art film staples engrossing in new context through louisa struggles she succeeds while alchemy isn always emotionally appealing it never loses its fascination even when we re not connecting with louisa who is often more of locus for ideas than fully developed personality there enough material on screen to hold our attention the cinematography is stunning city scenes are tinted with mavi adding cold bleak dimension to the film early portions later when louisa reaches the wilderness we re treated to dazzling array of autumnal splendor brightly colored leaves in the trees and on the ground it startling but effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa life as she travels the road back to emotional stability the title refers to the practice of group of mystical faith healers who use alchemy to provide for the needs of the body and soul and although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine it ultimately love and companionship not alchemy that brings solace her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is life ultimate goal even though louisa final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been more vital character it still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch alchemy isn pure magic but especially during its best moments it close

in the sweet hereafter writer director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living he shows us how it isn dying that hurts but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings on cold winter day in small isolated town in british columbia school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto frozen lake where it cracks through the ice and sinks fourteen children die and numerous others are hurt for the residents of this small town all of whose children were on that bus it is an earth shattering event that resolutely alters their lives they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle alberta and risa walker who own local motel and lost their child in the accident hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ian holm to bring lawsuit against someone anyone for responsibility the bus driver dolores driscoll gabrielle rose is kindly woman who loved the children and although she lives with burden of guilt is not held responsible for the accident the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice and there was nothing should could do to prevent it however according to stephens there are no accidents in life and someone will pay for this tragedy whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through he goes through the town approaching the parents who have lost children asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger and for his work stephens will receive one third of the settlement money however it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money he is driven by something else something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents he has lost child too but not in the same manner his daughter zoe caerthan banks who once almost died in his arms as young child after spider bite has been in and out of drug re hab clinics and detox stations for ten years she calls him on an irregular basis begging him for money but refusing to tell him what she needs it for don know who taking to he tells her in his mind his daughter is dead the lawsuit is to stephens not only way to mend the town pain but also his own however not everyone in town wants it to happen billy ansell bruce greenwood who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children wants nothing to do with it he has already lost his wife and he buries his grief in an affair with married woman he doesn want to talk about the accident and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds to him the town should be able to take care of its own pain and it doesn need outsiders like stephens getting in the way central to the sweet hereafter is the tale of nicole burnell sarah polley teenage girl who dreams of being singer before the accident turned her into wheelchair girl as she puts it aside from stephens nicole is the most complex character in the film and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out it is also her sad haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack reading robert browning poem about the pied piper and how when he led all the town children away one was left behind because he was crippled obviously nicole is that child and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town children left her alone by dying in the wreck her situation is further complicated because she is involved in loving but incestuous relationship with her father tom mccamus there is only one fleeting scene that suggests this relationship but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film of all the storylines in the sweet hereafter this is the most complicated and unresolved although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film egoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers if any at all and he doesn condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up what egoyan has done in the sweet hereafter is really nothing short of miraculous in his adaptation of the novel by russell banks he has made deeply moving film about lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life egoyan has always been talented but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold the sweet hereafter is quite the opposite egoyan stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion and draw the audience into the tragedy the sweet hereafter seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked the film is filled with beautiful subtle performances from all the actors especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind the beautiful roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting melodic musical score by mychael danna both previous egoyan collaborators give the film visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements like his earlier films egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form blanketing whole he works with time as fluid substance shifting back and forth between the past the distant past and the present with effortless ease the actual bus wreck itself doesn happen until midway through the film but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from distance with no graphic detail and still have it carry great devastating weight because human life has become such cheap commodity in movies it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple direct terms certainly one of the best films of 1997 the sweet hereafter is deeply rewarding mystifying and ultimately human film
when first heard about scream in 1996 was told that it was spoof of horror movies from the master of the horror himself wes craven it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them by making the teenagers do what they know they re not supposed to do when serial killer is stalking them don run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door never say ll be right back etc when first heard this description figured that it was an easy way out of making bad movie how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually mockery of other bad movies was this wes craven remedy from making real bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn it just seemed cheap to me then actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes involving drew barrymore and nail bitingly intense phone conversation completely changed my attitude scream is not only clever parody of your standard horror flick it also pretty scary movie if you ve seen million of these kinds of films you know exactly what is going to happen this is part of the fun of watching scream the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent attractive teenagers to those who rarely see these types of movies scream is thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as serious slasher film there nothing wrong with that misjudgment though have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience the newbies to horror and the fanatics their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive from these varied reviews am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed in my opinion if it was not for the outstanding success of scream the low budget 1996 gem may alongside pulp fiction be the most influential film of the 1990 this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs tingle or television programs such as dawson creek but to others such as myself we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors screenwriters and directors scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly paced script by kevin williamson within the film are characters who tell other characters as well as the audience the basic rules and cliches of horror movie mainly from the rants of randy jamie kennedy and stu matthew lillard we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well the virgin always survives have sex and you re dead meat not only are we treated these rules on plate but also the rules are referenced to number of different films and actors the script feels like an obsessive essay from college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self satisfaction in this case williamson finds these errors for the audience satisfaction and amusement hear there is new movie coming out called scary movie which is spoof of scream which is spoof of scary movies will certainly see the film but have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream perfect subtlety however my last gut feeling about this stuff scream was dead wrong so who knows
bob the happy bastard quickie review must admit no doubt single new is quite catchy it was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon the man who had brought us the humorous swingers little while back the result movie that just as good as that song really it follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend first we hear about grocery bagger sara polley who runs into monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at rave with bad results as drug dealer feels he been swindled by her then comes the story of an english grocery store worker same store who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends where sex gunplay and stolen car trouble come into play then we see the story of two gay movie actors played by scott wolf and jay mohr who deal with cop strange insurance presentation and hitting girl sara with their car and finally we come to another grocery worker katie holmes who has strange fascination with said drug dealer the one mentioned earlier really it all confusing to keep track of in review format your best bet is to just well go the movie features some very good acting from all angles and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product the dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending think of it as well ending the intertwining of stories is particularly good element to the movie as it never really confusing and tells different sides of the story like sliding doors kinda did however it better suited for the younger generation who want little spice in their flicks which sliding doors kinda isn

the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve for high school excursion alex french class is traveling to paris by airline transport alex tense and neurotic has shocking premonition after boarding he sees the plane and every passenger on it spontaneously explode in mid air in panic of sheer lunacy alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft after handful of others including one teacher follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane the unwitting survivors watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize but death won be cheated so easily and one by one the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi before delve into the meat of the review just like to confer is that one helluva premise or what `final destination creepy beyond rational comprehension probably reads more like an unsettling `x files episode than `the simpsons therefore the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong on familiar turf the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong and the opening 20 minutes of `final destination reflects that unlike most thrillers the set up is crisp and cool you just deeply sincerely hope that the momentum won unspool leaving us with second string effort with nothing but cheap derivative shocks young viewers have palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration what with `i know what you did last summer and sequel `idle hands and movie with nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil `urban legend after the set up when remained slouched apprehensively in my chair started to really have fun with `final destination low and behold teen thriller that is actually unsettling actually suspenseful and yes actually intelligent some splotty logic and heap of characteristic genre flaws aside this film is among the most refreshing and all out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting edge `scream in 1996 `final destination stimulates the nerves and offers exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood spattered slasher crap we ve endured throughout the past few years not that the characters are that good sawa is game as alex connect the dots personality that we never fully comprehend in addition the survivors are endearing geek tod chad donella jocky control freak carter kerr smith of `dawson creek carter ditzy girlfriend terry amanda detmer the none too subtly named billy hitchcock seann william scott supplier of lukewarm comic relief and lone teacher the emotionally delicate ms lewton kristin cloke aside from alex the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter `varsity blues playing an abstract character named clear rivers what were her parents thinking the personality of clear is written with such vague nebulous definition that she resembles walking flash card saying `hello am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character plight toss few stereotypical fbi agents daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith and ummm `spiritual mortician former `candyman tony todd into the mix and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing dicing and assorted disembowelments not so `final destination has no slicing and dicing or at least none dealt by human killer and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying murderer on the loose concept with assistance from shrewd intelligently paced screenplay by morgan wong and jeffrey reddick the plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity listen up `reindeer games but suppose the most satisfying aspect of `final destination is the murder scenes creative resourceful and breathlessly inventive the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to character demise what will trigger the accident will it be the john denver record just put on to play `rocky mountain high yeah sick humor will it be the leaking toilet the falling fishing reel in the corner the murders are startling and largely unforeseen including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly minute afterward sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach it gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes but who cares it fun in that simple regard `final destination is my cup of tea this stylishly executed thriller although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side after the show it will also have an frightening impact on you when will your design expire is death waiting around the corner the `final effect is major case of the heebie jeebies

scream has titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well during film class discussion windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are and why sequels never live up to the originals few rare exceptions are noted but they left out one scream 1996 surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america sequel was unavoidable but luckily the re teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment in fact at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream would say that scream might even be the better film sidney prescott neve campbell the sinuous heroine who survived series of murders in woodsboro ca in the original scream is now two years older and off to college majoring in theater meanwhile tv journalist gale weathers courtney cox who covered the murders in the first film has since written book about the dreadful events book titled stab which has been developed into major motion picture as scream opens crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into crowded movie theater for the premiere of stab and before long young couple are butchered to death unnoticed in the midst of hysteria this marks the beginning of new murder spree as an unknown copycat sets out to repeat what been done and finish what hasn of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film and yes movies play huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds but this is sequel and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given fresh outlook on horror movies this is in large part due to williamson deliciously written script which will easily leave you satisfied as much as the film condemns the use of cliches it is riddled with them but it is done so effectively and with skillful direction by craven that you re not bound to complain will note however that the whodunit did wind up being the first person suspected but believe me kept changing my mind as tried to stay one ahead of the movie all the actors outdo themselves here we re not talking oscar performances but cambell cox david arquette as dewey riley and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing the characters remain true to their roots and yet show clear sign of development over the last two years we can see how the events in the first film has affected them but we don lose any of the luster that made them such delight to watch in the first place the nice thing about scream is that it doesn seem off kilter from it predecessor it natural smooth and believable as far as horror films go transition from film to film we skip two years but there doesn seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks it flows so well that you feel more like you re reading chapter two of book long chapters eh than just revitalizing cast of familiar faces while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels scream entire plot structure correlates completely with the first making for immediate fondness and absorption as said before scream easily lives up to if not surpassing it precursor the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream is because it was the first this doesn mean that it overcasts the unique whimsical humor or overall caliber of it sequel it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it own while maintaining it sought after qualities if ever film followed it original so well it would be scream and it makes this definite must see for all those unbridled scream fans out there scream fits snugly alongside scream and will hopefully receive as many high remarks it would top off the series quite well if it weren for the fact that two movies don really make series it unlikely to assume that scream won appear in the next few years but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror trilogy let hope they can keep up the fantastic work like they say don mess with perfection but when money making smash hit is almost guaranteed who gonna listen
in these days of overlong movies meet joe siyah the thin kirmizi line the mask of zorro it is shame that films like waking ned devine can be longer than paltry 90 minutes this is just cute movie even through its mildly risque subject matter old friends jackie bannen and michael kelley try to find the lottery winner they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60 so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings through process of elimination they find that it must be lovable old ned devine who they find sitting in front of his tv clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand what results is thuroughly amusing as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong and that they could really benefit after all old ned won miss it rather than divulge the later twists and turns ll stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage bannen and kelly are perfect pair one slightly stout the other as thin as rail both getting on in years they make such cute pair of old codgers waking ned devine may even be seen as full monty for the geriatric set especially since kelly gets buff for one amusing scene waking ned devine is by no means perfect but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films the performances by everyone in the town are great particularly the two leads there is one twist at the end which find unnecessary but it hardly ruins the picture writer director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters scripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm not the exception perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more had held off on my year best worst list for another day waking ned devine officially released in late november of 98 surely would have graced the short group of the year finest films it is light but thought provoking and sweet can think of anyone who shouldn see or wouldn enjoy this film
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned the teaser trailers for my best friend wedding scarsely gave reason for hope it looked like the sort of goofy light hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight but little more frankly rarely seen trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend wedding was such success strong bouyant romantic comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects featuring triumphant performance from ms roberts the heroine of my best friend wedding is julianne potter julia roberts successful new york restaurant critic and we open the film with whimsical revelation to her editor george downes rupert everett that years ago she had made pact with her dear best friend and ex lover michael neal dermot mulroney sports writer that if they both hadn married by the time they reached 28 they had promised to marry each other both julianne and michael are both single of course and when george inquires about michael age julianne realizes that he mere weeks away from his 28th birthday and is quite distressed when she receives phone call from michael later that day however she finds herself even more distraught when michael call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace cameron diaz and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary the setup for my best friend wedding then is fairly conventional one and in many ways the film storyline is formulaic but only to certain extent the film was directed by hogan whose first feature muriel wedding had quite an offbeat tone for traditional uplifting ugly duckling story and the same holds true for my best friend wedding which confidently combines traditional romantic comedy elements with really eccentric sense of humour the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr hogan for example there heartfelt emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film with trio of teenagers inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks harmonizing in the background my best friend wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of musical as woody allen everyone says love you even assert it more successful one my best friend wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well in typical romantic comedy kimmy would be portrayed as snooty conniving ice queen and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps this film is smarter than that here kimmy is sweet sincere and innocent julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy life she actually like her too the george character is almost staple of recent film the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason but in my best friend wedding he gets to have playful mischievous and charming personality throughout the film the formulaisms one often sees is romantic comedy are given little twists and the result is film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion there is lot of smart writing in the well paced screenplay by ronald bass we re given four interesting vivid and likeable characters with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments my best friend wedding marks strong career rebound for julia roberts who turns in top notch confident and reassured performance as julianne this isn the sort of role one usually associates with ms roberts the julianne character neurotic fumbling characteristics are more in line with meg ryan role but ms roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience if not entirely sympathetic even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable even better than ms roberts though is cameron diaz who turns in shining performance in my best friend weddding with smile which lights up the screen she effectively conveys kimmy insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner and never hits false note in the film she even sings won soon forget her charming serenade of just don know what to do with myself rupert everett is given very juicy role as george and he makes the most of it with hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film his george is bit of devilish rogue entirely affable and mr everett performance is delight to watch he clearly having fun and his joy is infectuous dermot mulroney is adequate in thankless role unlike the other characters in the film he not given lot to do but there is genuine onscreen chemistry between ms roberts and mr mulroney and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic when julia roberts lustre began to fade and she was usurped from her title as america sweetheart by sandra bullock thought it was canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says love you to raise her profile while that didn quite work out it near certain that her successful return to the genre which made her big star back in 1990 the romantic comedy will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game my best friend wedding marks return to form for ms roberts and cements hogan reputation as skilled director of comedy
david lynch mavi velvet begins and ends with colorful bright shots of flowers and happy americans mowing their lawns in seemingly perfect american town however what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is strange world of drug dealers sadists and murderers the opening and closing shots are wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy disturbing film they show not to make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances odd would be perfect adjective to describe this film its characters its direction and its story thankfully the obscurity that mavi velvet relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable since its elements are so originally weird you never know what will happen next this is the main goal of movie to be spontaneous and surprising mavi velvet miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting lynch creates such hypnotic world that it is hard to resist his style of story telling the film starts off with the discovery of severed ear by college boy kyle maclachlan from this point maclachlan finds himself involved with lounge singer isabella rossellinia who has lost her son and husband to kidnapping the plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynch story telling so amazing maclachlan becomes involved in forbidden relationship in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of high school flick and he is put into the shoes of drug dealer who has some wild adventures with some wild friends through these multiple stories maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan we are introduced to variety of interesting subplots lynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make convenient crowd pleasing conclusion instead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times lynch has been known to do this with number of his films meaning he may be too esoteric for some hoping to get hollywood ending where the good guy gets the girl and everything turns out fine however for fans of odd difficult indies mavi velvet could be just what they are looking for it is very hard to discuss mavi velvet without discussing the performance of dennis hopper sadistic frank most of the other actors in the film were not very memorable kyle maclachlan lacked one important aspect for his role personality laura dern was consistently annoying but dennis hopper stole every scene he was in his evil character was just plain old frightening in his mannerisms from his obsession to velvet to his incessant breathing from gas mask frank is character that comes along once in mavi moon many producers know this and have inevitably begun to typecast hopper as the bad guy just like his villain in speed hopper is over the edge with cursing and screaming every chance he has to speak this harshness is exactly what frank is so weird and twisted that it is hard not to look at him even if he theatens you to look away mavi velvet has characters and stories you will never see in movie again for this sole reason it is recommended but also see it to admire lynch obsession to avoid the norm even if this film is little too weird for you it hard not to congratulate guy for trying something new and sticking to it
those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that have not read victor hugo novel les miserables don know if lot of people have though imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel haven even seen that going into this film had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters even expected the film to be musical walking away from it kind of glad had no prior experience with the material writer director bille august film version is straightforward beautifully told film liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean in the beginning he has just been released from 19 year prison sentence he is allowed to stay in convent by kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior the priest words of wisdom influence him and he makes vow to change himself nine years later we are informed that he is now the mayor of town called vigo nobody knows his real name and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago conflicts arise when inspector javert geoffrey rush is assigned to vigo valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him and javert remembers jean to be convict javert is hell bent on upholding the law and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice along the way valjean meets and falls in love with peasant woman fantine uma thurman and vows to take care of her daughter cosette played later by claire danes les miserables is visually solid and often striking picture the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast and the sets don look like sets they look like real towns and villages gabriella pescucci costumes are noticeably spectacular basil poledouris soundtrack is thick and usually well placed though it does get bit heavy at times many scenes in the film have memorable photographic quality such as the climax which takes place next to dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening augusts keeps the story simple which hear is good thing since the novel is so complex and easy to follow he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately was also impressed that he didn go overboard with flash and style which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days such as baz luhrmann vicious tragedy william shakespeare romeo juliet this film feels solid and whole and each scene has certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested liam neeson is terrific in the main role neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well and valjean is certainly man who clearly fits that adjective thurman in her small role is very good and proves that she has lot of range and can perform in very non glamorous role such as this one rush is absolutely incredible as javert don remember ever feeling so strongly about villain as do here he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense can be as charitable for danes however though know she is talented actress here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character bit les miserables is as ve said solid intelligent motion picture my only complaint is that it feels bit too easy and perhaps too staged each scene is grand and huge and exploding with poledouris score but didn always want them to be for the most part les miserables is not subtle or deep picture it good movie and tells its story well but august tends to hand feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle however in film this exciting and well produced few minor flaws are easily overlooked
satirical films usually fall into one of two categories long term satire where everything including the jokes is somehow related on large scale dr strangelove situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene men in siyah what unique about wag the dog is that it doesn necessarily fit either of these descriptions and yet is both at the same time the result is clever comedy based on an original smart premise even if the focus does tend to wander bit if there anything that affects americans the most it politics and showbusiness in this age of information and technology we ve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things it gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it we need the media to bring us the most up to date news but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas and then presents an interesting scenario if politics the media coverage of politics and the entertainment industry are so closely related couldn someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all that the idea conrad brean de niro professional washington spin doctor comes up with in order to restore the president good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election brean along with the president top advisor winifred ames heche fly to california to meet up with hot shot movie producer stanley motss hoffman they pitch him an idea to produce the image of war with albania it country no one heard of so they people will buy it soon the wheels are in motion and the film riffing satire comes into play we re inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in number of experts to help manage the situation such as folk singer visual and sound effects technicians and modern style expert known as the fad king leary the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv in the movies or in the news the characters dialogue is witty and funny although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom esque for example one scene shows motss and brean production crew filming an actress portraying poor albanian refugee motss ordered kitten for the girl to carry but instead wound up with dozen different dogs since it all computer enhanced anyway she ends up cradling bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later this demonstrates the film ability to take relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise but then there the gags and one liners that although are humorous seem little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress name or whenever problem emerges always responding with this is nothing by the time the film makes it to the midpoint everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens the first act is quickly paced while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film every ten minutes or so new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with and it always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head on in realistic manners however it does have tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something bit off the subject as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture what had started off as brilliant somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in movie still the situation comedy is quite funny especially montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt willie schumann war hero motss and brean concocted truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time but think about afterwards and wag the dog at least succeeds in this respect however in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes then again it valiant effort
when people are talking about good old times they actually want to make some bad times look better nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s for new generations superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids for people who actually had to live in that period it was the gloomy decade marked by lost ideals of 1968 rampant inflation and unemployment international terrorism fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for feelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era martin scorsese taxi driver which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies is most celebrated of them all the movie protagonist is travis bickle robert de niro 26 year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can sleep at nights the job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world the only bright spot in his life is betsy cybil sheperd attractive woman working in senator palantine presidential campaign their date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre losing his only link to better side of the world travis gradually descends into psychosis becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street he purchases formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict that conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris jodie foster 12 year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi as many great movies that got cult status through the years taxi driver became the object of many interpretations for some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski loss of moral compass in bleak reality of dirty overpopulated industrial cities the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times for others the movie uses raskolnikov like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of lifetime can give arguments for both sides his travis bickle has lot in common with most of the average viewers of today many of us share his feelings of isolation loneliness and outrage towards crime drugs prostitution and senseless street violence his pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him sometimes in most unusual circumstances like with secret service agents pimps or job interviewers make him person too goofy to be the hero and too pathetic to be the classic villain however most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen but despite anything average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis his crusade against scum is something that average person wants but doesn have stomach lack of brains to do it while de niro travis might come in and out of particular times and places other persons that appear in the film mostly played by the character actors give it distinctively 1970s feel wizzard played by peter boyle presents the only link with america better past but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he knows stuff his obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre 1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade other characters on the other hand show the bad side of new age matthew sport keitel who befriended real life pimps in other to prepare for his role of lifetime is dressed like hippie iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in ideology of counterculture porno movies that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom are too much even for supposedly liberated betsy even the politicians like senator palantine are lost in post vietnam and post watergate mess his broad and senseless messages that cover the lack of any serious program can fool even such idiots like travis the past is gone the present is bad and even the future seems bleak and the feeling of pessimism can be washed away even by ironic happy end travis and his world found themselves in desperate situation and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader screenplay into the silver screen new york city in the night is portrayed as hell on earth and the kirmizi light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal almost stygian atmosphere another important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture one of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was same as his protagonist famous for the wrong reason instead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits for many years it was tabloid fodder because of hinckley and his real life re enactment of events in the movie now more than two decades later when some other life imitating art incidents get more attention we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory
in my review of there something about mary said something to the effect of laughter isn everything now need to make brief addendum to my postulate laughter isn everything unless watching jim abrahams film see spoofs are easy with me love movies and love movies that make fun of movies that love sometimes the only one in the theater laughing sometimes laugh so hard that embarass myself because my laugh is so high pitched in comparison to my speaking voice it cuts right through everyone else laughter sometimes laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film abraham latest film mafia induced this kind of hysteria upon me it gotten some mediocre reviews but hey the guy who laughs at everything there may be lot of jokes that flop in this film but there are far more that work and laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought provoking most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things like develop characters shape stories and other such nonsense mafia has no pretentions about characters or story and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh the film begins on the perfect high note with mockery of the opening of casino our hero jay mohr is seen walking from casino and getting into his car which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against backdrop of flowing fire to describe the story of mafia is absurd and pointless but will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films with lot of casino references inserted throughout along the way the parodies seem arbitrary and rarely victimize mob films pictures like the english patient forrest gump and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing movies like this rely on just few things but the most important element is direction abrahams has been down this path many times before hot shots top secret airplane and any other film with an exclamation point in the title and so hold most of the success of mafia to his experience he takes just the right attitude in each scene and manages to wring at least bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic but it never develops the actors are all energetic which helps lot with the tone of the film mohr suicide kings paulie who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors is so good here he looks like he having so much fun that he containing his laughter in every scene watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool he probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material lloyd bridges does decent imitation of brando godfather while pamela gidley is dead on in full blown mockery of sharon stone the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that supposed to give examples of things and be specific unfortunately was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia that can remember lot of what made me laugh but that good sign mafia is so funny that wasn even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory laughed so hard that it shut off my brain know that doesn sound particularly complimentary but when watching dumb comedy like this the first thing want to do is shut off my brain finally film that does this for me
for more than decade anjelica huston has been one of america finest actresses in her directorial debut bastard out of carolina based upon dorothy allison largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth in post world war ii south carolina through voice over narration done by laura dern we find that she nearly didn survive birth as her single mother anney played by jennifer jason leigh was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident that just the beginning of her troubles bone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come anney meets and weds lyle kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone baby sister before dying in an automobile accident anney brother earle played by michael rooker introduces her to glen played by ron eldard co worker at the mill glen the siyah sheep of wealthy family when are you gonna make your daddy proud ll tell you when never he told and filled with bitterness courts anney and eventually wins her despite warnings of violent temper when anney miscarries with his much prized baby boy glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone beating and abusing her while the love dependent anney tries to turn blind eye and justify his behaviour things turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment while set several decades ago this story remains completely relevant in today society where abused wives return to their husbands and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other the real star of this domestic drama is not top billed jennifer jason leigh but child actress jena malone who plays bone in wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance her work is of award calibre and in this age in which preponderence of superb child performers have emerged kirsten dunst tina majorino anna paquin natalie portman christina ricci elijah wood malone performance stands up well leigh performance in bastard out of carolina is fine although she not really given much to do and ron eldard work is very solid skillfully manouvering his character moods in and out of explosive rage one can always sense that underneath his glen is pressure cooker ticking away of the supporting cast special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker performance there bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms to the familiar sight of dried up uptight wise old granny played by grace zabriskie sitting on the porch rocking chair to impassioned soliloquies better suited for stage performance still it cannot be denied that anne meredith screenplay contains wallop of emotional power huston direction of the film is surehanded and impressive giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast particularly the young malone her sequences of child abuse are shot in hard hitting emotional rather than graphic manner and are very effective huston talent with camera positioning is wonderful from visually striking shot done through fan to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile the film has the toned down feel of television production bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant but as whole bastard out of carolina adds up to powerful viewer experience worth seeing
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned all the world stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts excerpt from as you like it act ii scene when william shakespeare penned this passage he could not have possibly envisioned world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash this is the world of today and it is the perfect climate to unveil prototypical high concept project like the truman show truman burbank jim carrey seems to have the perfect life he has pretty doting wife meryl laura linney comfortable insurance sales position an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven reliable childhood buddy marlon noah emmerich except for the dog that paws greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia this is paradise or so it would seem bizarre inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in truman life lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term isolated follows him around radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move for the first time in his life it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be the truman show directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol is remarkably well constructed film paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next balancing drama with humour thoughtfulness with abandon this is film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy in many ways mr niccol screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity with pivotal character defining moments occurring at sea although the film rather conventional climax doesn sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two thirds and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film it remains foremost finely crafted piece of entertainment constantly light and accessible the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude and as the carefully stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down the film eschews any psychological ramifications for man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to rehash of the reliable crowdpleasing underdog vs the system formula while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept some elements are lacking the device of mysterious lauren sylvia natascha mcelhone as contributing impetus to truman growing awareness isn exactly convincing there not much of discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ed harris with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film in fact although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman artificial utopia to mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even more deeply in the insulatory seahaven world with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling still the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city ve always believed that the versatile ms linney possesses tremendous comic gift she has always seems to have impish gleam in her eyes and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character mischievously flashing glazed insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans cheerfully going over the top it hilarious to watch her who would have ever guessed that she have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of film ms linney is delight in the film but it is mr carrey who rules the show here he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal it difficult not to root for truman in commanding performance mr carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him genuinely engaging presence and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn demonstrating admirable restraint there an early scene where he down on his knees gardening and given his past track record one almost instinctively anticipates mr carrey to pull one of more infamous and in this case wholly inappropriate sight gags it almost poetic how this notorious look at me actor successfully tones it down to play character who constantly the centre of attention in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast mr emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character sense of sturdy trustworthiness the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman antiseptic beyaz picket fenced smalltown utopia and by burkhard dallwitz original score technical credits are first rate all around while the truman show is clearly definitive high concept film it not exactly dazzlingly innovative one obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound ranging from 1965 secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner all the same this is visionary award calibre film entertaining provocative and intelligent the curious and possibly disturbing thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film concept seems unfathomably outrageous it abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching if not actualisation at least permissiveness of such scenario perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question perhaps we recognize bit of ourselves in this world

after being hypnotized man believes there is ghost in his house the review two low key summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year the blair witch project and the sixth sense each has made well over $100 million in north america based on combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising if film box office take were based primarily on its quality stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected for it is as scary if not scarier than the other two writer director david koepp has given artisan entertainment the folks who distributed blair witch second creepy hit the story gets going after tom witzky bacon an average blue collar dad gets hypnotized by his wife maggie erbe sister lisa douglas at party while the hypnosis goes as expected to the party goers it triggers something in tom head things begin to change around him blinking kirmizi lights let off strange hum for example and he fights to stay in control of his own senses where these experiences take tom maggie and their son jake cope who tom thinks might have some answers is down dark path that will scare and disturb you david koepp keeps the action localized the majority of the action takes place at tom house or just down the street by keeping things at home koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy segues montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to another etc unfortunately the dread and spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted by moments of levity humour can take the tension away from scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting several tense moments become completely diffused by few misplaced jokes also there are couple of plot developments that are left unresolved though to mention them would be to give too much away kevin bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and man losing his sanity admirably his total lack of understanding of what is happening to him is believable as are the reactions from his wife maggie kathryn erbe is given role meatier and better written than that of most wife who can no longer handle her husband parts while it is still supporting role her maggie is moving as she watches both her husband and her son enter what she calls private club that not invited to where they whisper about things all day long as jake zachary cope equals the performance of haley joel osment in the sixth sense but gets less screen time both children manage the same trick making the audience creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way things are fans of blair and sixth sense will almost surely love stir of echoes it combines the dread of blair creepy closed in feel thanks to cinematographer fred murphy and great performances by the whole cast specifically bacon to give the fall its first genuine scary film if only they had let up on the unneeded funny bits and tweaked the plot bit more this could have been one of the year best
wong kar wei fallen angels is on purely visceral level one of the most exciting films ve seen in long while unfortunately wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for ordinarily that alone would be enough to sink movie but in the case of fallen angels this is not so every shot in this film is exciting just to look at wong does really interesting things with the camera but he doesn allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over as was the case with last years dismal knock off which contained shot of foot entering shoe ugh the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives can say much more than that as didn really know what was going on most of the time in fact it wasn until about halfway through the movie that was able to distinguish between each character the constantly moving camera doesn really allow for the audience to associate with any one character we re always kept at distance from these people suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters fallen angels is refreshing change of pace from most hollywood films which never bother to try anything different at least on visual level in fact go so far as to say that fallen angels is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film ve ever seen sure there directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death but to see filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating but if wong wishes to become legendary filmmaker he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images there were far too many instances during fallen angels in which asked myself now who are these people again is this that first couple or the second couple it was impossible to keep track perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which by introducing them to us with name cards as in scorsese mean streets that really besides the point though wong kar wei has proven himself through very few films that he movie maker to watch let just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies
bob the happy bastard quickie review the mummy brendan fraser stuck in the past again but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone fraser is the lead star of the mummy the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising it rough adaptation of the 1932 film and say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages like boris karloff was engulfed in but who cares the movie has sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can get from oh say godzilla or armageddon fraser plays soldier who gets premonition during battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground basically it little sign from the mummy buried underneath priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress his plan wake back up and wake her up also making him invincible of course fraser returns to the site years later with librarian rachel weisz and her brother john hanna along with former buddy of his deep rising kevin connor and some americans and guess what yup ihmoetep arnold vosloo awakens and wreaks havoc fire flies from the sky flesh eating beetles crawl about and well ihmoetep plan begins to unfold ok so it not really all that new story but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch and the acting from fraser and weisz isn half bad either the action is pretty intense favorite scene the sandstorm and there are few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror loving folks as well no it no phantom menace beater but if you re looking for solid warm up to the summer movie season you won find better film under wraps than the mummy if this doesn give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man then nothing will
what do you get when you combine clueless and dumb and dumber to answer the question you get director david mirkin new comedy romy and michele high school reunion romy beyaz mira sorvino mighty aprhodite and michele weinberger lisa kudrow tv friends have been inseparable buddies since they graduated from sagebrush high in 1987 however when former classmate heather mooney janeane garafolo the truth about cats and dogs confronts romy about the 10 year reunion she is astounded that she forgot watching pretty woman for the um teenth time they are reminded of how they wouldn let julia roberts character shop in the expensive stores because of her appearance then it hits them they are not successful what are she and michele going to do romy instant solution is lose some weight off their already slender frames bag couple of boyfriends and get jobs romy says this will be easy but michele retorts that if it is so easy why hadn they already done it robin schiff script keeps the show moving with some nice one liners one of the best has romy reminiscing about her life battle against the bathroom scales was so lucky getting mono she says looking at her thinnest high school picture that was like the best diet ever the casting for the film is so perfect that one begins to suspect that the leads were chosen and then the script was developed romy and michele use their high school yearbook to discuss the caste system at their high school the film editor david finfer dissolves the stills from the yearbook to live action flashbacks which makes the past come to life at sagebrush high the hierarchy consisted of the group cheerleaders the group drama club and the group nerds romy and michele were none of the above ridiculed as the weirdoes they were constant targets for abuse even though they were quite attractive they had so much fun being together that they did not care about the others that they make their own outlandish clothes helped keep the wall around them complementing romy and michele lightness is janeane garofalo as the dark pudgy heather mooney heather who invented new cigarette paper for cigarettes with twice the taste in half the time for the gal on the go has the success and the money that they would like heather was even more of an outsider than they were in high school garofalo one dimensional role is only side show this is two person film with the other characters there merely for the two leads to bounce their lines off of the genuine chemistry between sorvino and kudrow makes for sweet and sometimes touching comedy they have so much fun acting out their parts their enjoyment spreads to the audience
like the great musical pieces of mozart himself amadeus is true work of art it is one of those few movies of the 80 that will be known for its class its style and its intelligence why is this such good film there are almost too many reasons to explain the story court composer salieri murray abraham feels waves of different emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart tom hulce comes into his life as the young genius composer salieri feels envy and jealousy but at the same time is fascinated with mozart brilliance and ingenious we travel through mozart life as composer through his struggles his triumphs and ultimately his demise the acting abraham is magnificient as salieri his acting range enables him to focus on each individual emotion and express it through his speech and body language this performance earned him well deserved oscar tom hulce is interesting as well as mozart quirky annoying bratty kid with an annoying laugh he strong but weak at the same time and must be aided by his wife elizabeth berridge who is good in her role but lacks dramatic depth jeffrey jones in smaller more dignified role than such roles in stay tuned and mom and dad save the world is cast perfectly because of his noble charm the movie every element of this movie works the costumes and makeup are very memorable as well as its stunning art direction and unforgettable scores adapted from mozart original music while wolfgang amadeus mozart was genius at music milos forman proves with his film that he is genius of filmmaking this movie is classic that will be remembered for years to come ad2am almost lost my nose and like it like breathing through it jack nicholson chinatown
it tough to really say something nice about type of person who so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone but by god american history does it and for that commend it it not only takes balls but intelligence to make human being out of neo nazi skinhead kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who not what they are and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off the subject of this film is one of them but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack he the one who instigates them to take firm grip onto their rage and then in another brilliant stroke justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks he so utterly convincing as public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process his name is derek vinyard and he played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he almost as convincing and arresting public speaker as say malcom when we first see him he clean shaven with jet siyah swastica emrboidered on his left breast devlish goatee and he attacking the siyah carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his beyaz boxers and carrying handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets at least when he doesn need them he so believes in his convictions that he willing to put his beliefs to the test even if he knows it will mean stop in prison if only for couple years american history is about derek how he became neo nazi skinhead how he rose to power how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two siyah men in fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself and how he tried to save others namely his younger brother from making the same mistake we see him at all of these stages as smart teenager vicious hate monger man having an epiphany and the man who tries to correct what he done before and in all of these we get portrait of man from all sides or at least that the intention the film framing device is his brother danny edward furlong perpetually looking about 13 also now skinhead and how his principal bob sweeney avery brooks who just found out was or is the captain on star trek deep space is trying to correct him when the film opens danny has just written book report on mein kampf landing him in trouble with sweeney which causes him to make him write paper on derek life and how it has gotten him nowhere coincidentally this day is the day derek is released from prison and when we see him he cleaned up not as buff and has full head of hair he just as intelligent but still very rough along the edges but he wisened up he no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews and tries to persuade danny who becoming what derek was before to give up his lifestyle but danny won he goes to large skinhead beer bash meets with the skinhead leader stacy keach and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo nazi dom as he was for it couple of years ago the film circles around this then spins off into non linear flashbacks all done in siyah and beyaz we mostly see derek at his prime as skinhead living in venice beach organizing vicious and quasi sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the beyaz middle class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on to them the beyaz man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop and he not only speaks elloquently forcefully and intelligently but he backs everything up with political reasons justifying their rage at least to them and frighteningly enough much of what he says sounds true american history is collection of really great scenes and moments rather than cohesive great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next in it there are some of the best scenes ve seen all year one scene features dinner between derek family and his mother newest boyfriend played with reserve by eliott gould jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek rightist views launching the scene into fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience gould reaction to derek final summation is unnerrving another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build friendship and nice connection between derek and siyah co worker guy torry while folding laundry in prison and another soon to be classic is actually divided in two the murder of the two siyah men that winds derek in jail which contains final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year there much more to appreciate like the acting which is uniformly good with stand outs coming from avery brooks beverly angelo as the long suffering mother and gould who has one horrible line but other than that comes off with the best performance he given in what seems like really long time norton walks off with the film though coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble in only the fifth movie of his career norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation and maybe the best there nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience coming off with power similar to that of young maron brando that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing sadly enough this isn going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be it too unambitious and even little contrived to really take off as either powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece the ending especially is pencilled in from other movies tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the fat skinhead whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more and even the dramatic arc isn as well travelled furlong danny never seems to really be learning lesson since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view and when he decides to make change by the end which was inevitable it doesn seem like it has actually arrived there even derek descent into skinhead dom doesn seem justified though his fireman father william russ the dad from boy meets world and don ask me how know that is killed by siyah junkie and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs as such one can see why the director tony kaye wanted to have his name removed sorta american history is very good movie and was very moved by it but it could be lot better and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential somewhere he claims there lies tony kaye cut and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton who then ordered another cut and that is thus although he aimed for the directing credit to go to alan smithee the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director it wasn allowed to him under the grounds that once you disown film you can not badmouth it but really that the macguffin no one really wanted film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval kaye right in that it not up to par even if he not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par this will not be do the right thing for the late 90s yet it still gets its point across intelligently and backs it up with its story its message that one cannot be so enwrapped in one own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur is literally said over the narration unfortunately and even if it isn perfect at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison and asks him if anything he done has made his life any better it realy hits nerve not only in derek but also in the audience

martin scorsese films used to intimidate me because of his reputation felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks as much as enjoyed them usually felt like missed something learned from scorsese casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies for example in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on or toward the end when he uses three quick dissolves to compress scene of car backing away from building again the simple mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing don mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good looking but he simply uses the best tool for the job it shouldn have surprised me then that kundun film about mystical religion actually turned out to be quite straightforward the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama the spiritual and political leader of tibet the movie title is another name for the dalai lama which means ocean of wisdom his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story one of which makes an interesting statement pay attention to the film opening shot and watch where it is repeated we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old his curiosity and self assuredness capture the attention of monk wandering in search of the new lama test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own the boy picks correctly proving that he is the new and the old dalai lama scorsese and long time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk before selecting an item he would look at the monk perhaps for some sort of confirmation sometimes he picked right the first time and sometimes he made second choice either way whether through reincarnation or quick human perception the tibetans were assured of choosing boy who could be wise perceptive leader >from this point on the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama spirit and the future leader of nation it is great weight to put on the mind of child in the it might be grounds for call to social services but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming genuinely likeable well rounded person certain patterns take shape over the years for example the dalai lama is fascinated by technology radios clocks and telescopes are some of his favorite toys when he is old enough to accept his leadership he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet he also has soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain including herd animals it nearly running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet gigantic neighbor china tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china as first the propaganda then the political pressure and finally the armies come across their common border the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama life is in danger if he stays the movie ends when after much agonizing the dalai lama leaves tibet for india the story doesn lead up to cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do it just doesn fit that mold if it were forced into such shape it would have been completely different movie perhaps more like seven years in tibet which is good in its own right the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events not vice versa perhaps because the pace is slower we have more time to notice the beautiful art vestments and architecture of tibet mandala tibetan sand painting with beautiful vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie the robes and hats of state are bright kirmizi and altin the bricks are rich reddish brown not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie which is usually light mavi is the kirmizi and altin of tibet philip glass composed the music for kundun and he was the perfect choice for those who don know of glass his music is like tibetan mandala his building blocks are lots of small notes tiny grains of music which are first grouped then repeated in patterns these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of larger composition people won be flocking to kundun for it great ending or talking about its outstanding plot but it does have lot to offer an interesting lifetime exotic sights rich cinematography and innovative music it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes warm look at the dalai lama as person on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese who gives the film strong beautiful consistent look
in this good natured pleasent and easy going comedy bill murray ghostbusters 1984 plays grumpy weatherman phil conners who every year is sent to punxsutawney to report on groundhog day the groundhog day ceremony involves groundhog being lifted out of box and if he dosen see shadow it will be an early spring phil really hates the ceremony and not even his producer rita macdowell can change his mind however fate has cruel trick for phil and he starts re living groundhog day over and over and over until he gradually likes it and rita falls in love with him groundhog day is well written totatly unoffensive and funny comedy the screenwriters director ramis and danny rubin have written funny warm but never overly senitmental comedy although the idea of day repeating over and over may sound tedious there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film ramis direction also helps and although he dosen try any flash director tricks the film is directed well enough and the jokes are set up well and the editing is also good especially when it shows one part of the day over and over again such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita the performances are also excellent bill murray is great fun and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth and delivers his lines in his usual smary style andie macdowell is good as rita although sometimes she is just little bit too sweet in some parts of the film there is chemistry between the two leads thankfully otherwise the whole film would probably fall part chris elliot as the cameraman larry is also funny although you have to like his goofy style otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall the supporting cast aren bad either with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson and even director ramis popping up as neurologist in fact there is not one dud performance in this film and even the groundhog gets funny scene involving car chase overall there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all it almost seems perfect however the film can get bit soppy sometimes and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over and over and over and over also there not much of an music score and the music there is is pretty bad but these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all overall then groundhog day is funny smart and also has some room in there for some heart an excellent comedy overall rating=
here is film that is so unexpected so scary and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for loop okay it isn quite original considering it is sequel to the box office hit species but it certainly is smart most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy horror films from the 50s and 60s and some even become them however as we learned with the 1995 small budget horror sci fi film sometimes expectations can be shattered lot of criticism has gone against this film from what have read so far anyway yep all two reviews and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory laughable pieces of trash but the thing is it isn it well made well acted and quite intelligent can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film but the species series isn about the lack of these elements it about how much it can get into one film and yet behind it all it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so species ii begins in the present day though it seems to be an alternate universe many films especially sci fi ones create similar timelines as our realistic one but change it to fit the film needs species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft the excursion landing on the surface of mars aboard is patrick ross justin lazard very bright and very handsome astronaut patrick is the son of senator ross james cromwell who just wants patrick to succeed well it would seem that he has succeeded landing on the surface of mars he is the first human being to ever do so of course he isn the first ever about billion years ago an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life now of course the kirmizi planet is cold and rocky no life lives on it that is no visible life patrick upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the kirmizi soil collects samples from the ground he takes them aboard and puts them in storage unfortunately one of the samples contains form of life and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship just prior to heading back to earth this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings they pass out for approximately seven minutes and then shrug it off as nothing because they can even remember they blame it on technical malfunction back on earth patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible as we know from the original this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet however the children that are bred are half human as their father is patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with and he finds it in eve natasha henstridge eve was cloned from dna taken from sil the original alien however this time around most of her alien urges have been either decreased dramatically or lie dormant the project is led by dr laura baker marg helgenberger reprising her role from species and her motives seem respectable since she was involved with the original alien attack she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again and it has story wise species ii is much stronger than its predecessor but it is also much stronger than say aliens hey love the film but you can tell me it was strong on story what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college we learned about piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars later it was proven that it was not living creature that created it the script uses this effectively but also manages to provide well balanced plot beginning with the first man on mars something have always dreamed of seeing was hoping that the film would turn this element into useful starting point for the movie and it does it quite well the characters are all smart and they know what to do and what not to do the only character that seems little cliched is the general george dzundza and yet he remains logical in everything he does there are the obvious flaws of course mostly lying in the technical aspects the special effects are only mediocre and some are just plain bad but for the most part they remain believable even noticed homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children also the most realistic ones are usually the goriest ranging from people being torn open or someone head being blown off however some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience including menage troi that is all but necessary many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex nudity and gory violence however tend to disagree what were the alien films about and if an alien species ever did come to earth and their sole purpose was to destroy us wouldn you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for mate in grocery store didn realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with just assume it is his part human side looking for the most beautiful one the acting is quite good for this kind of film it is vast improvement over the first film at least the acting is the key element to this film if it was bad it would have lowered itself into camp if it was good it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens okay so it isn that good george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting as his over the top impersonation of general makes him annoying and distracting natasha henstridge is limited this time around as she is usually enclosed in cage however she does manage very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent oh yeah and she quite fun to just plain watch marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around and her performance is probably the best in this film michael madsen is so so but he isn annoying and he soon becomes rather appealing with his nice cynic personality james cromwell has small part but he makes it much better than what it could have been with more incapable actor as say any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance and he gives the film more down to earth feel and of course justin lazard lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance but think he is effective sure he is wooden but isn that what his character is like the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done due to the couple acting species ii is rated for strong sexuality sci fi violence gore and language this is definitely an rated film that young kids should not see more than likely they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives hell don even know if will what is sure to be critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year probably won see another film where was expecting so little and got so much for quite while director peter medak has crafted very suspenseful and sometimes very scary movie out of mediocre series medak has also mastered the wonderful jump moments and has probably the second scariest moment have ever seen on film scream still has the first strong acting smart dialogue intelligent plotting and sure handed director species ii is exactly what these films should be entertaining
steven spielberg second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film spielberg ever the student on film has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest and most powerful entries he also managed to cast this era greatest answer to jimmy stewart tom hanks who delivers performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle for about 160 out of its 170 minutes saving private ryan is flawless literally the plot is simple enough after the epic day invasion whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular capt john miller hanks and his team are forced to search for pvt james ryan damon whose brothers have all died in battle once they find him they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home accompanying miller are his crew played with astonishing perfection by group of character actors that are simply sensational barry pepper adam goldberg vin diesel giovanni ribisi davies and burns are the team sent to find one man and bring him home the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary literally there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film first 20 minutes spielberg films almost the entire movie without music leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion and they do to perfection the sequences in france all of them beginning with the battle and ending with the battle are fabulous especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides trying to save private ryan there are no words can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences this is what coppola was looking for in apocalypse now but couldn create the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war the performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary he is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world with his comic timing dramatic flair his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears hanks is this country finest actor and he proves it here however spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece with chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film the sequence involving army chief of stafff george marshall and mrs ryan is decent but doesn hold up to the rest of the film relying on wartime cliches to power it but that is forgivable what isn is the bookends of the film the cemetary sequences the first one is quite good decent introduction into the lives of these men the last sequence is atrocious the forced emotion accompanied by ridiculous piece of music is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film these flaws are what downgrade ryan from the greatest film of our era to the greatest war film of our era spielberg should have trusted his own material and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie to end his masterpiece right there the use of the flag though patriotic is in contrast to the movie theme the power of the bulk of the film however is astonishing spielberg has truly made wondrous work of art that persists even after first viewing of the film is extraordinary this is the film of the year
