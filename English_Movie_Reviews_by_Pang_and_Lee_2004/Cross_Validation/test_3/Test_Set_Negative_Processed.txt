it is movies like these that make jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch based on the late 1960 television show by the same name the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover however things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion of course the ads make it seem like so much more quick cuts cool music claire dane nice hair and cute outfits car chases stuff blowing up and the like sounds like cool movie does it not after the first fifteen minutes it quickly becomes apparent that it is not the mod squad is certainly slick looking production complete with nice hair and costumes but that simply isn enough the film is best described as cross between an hour long cop show and music video both stretched out into the span of an hour and half and with it comes every single clich it doesn really matter that the film is based on television show as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we ve already seen the characters and acting is nothing spectacular sometimes even bordering on wooden claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored which really transfers onto the audience the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi who plays the resident crazy man ultimately being the only thing worth watching unfortunately even he not enough to save this convoluted mess as all the characters don do much apart from occupying screen time with the young cast cool clothes nice hair and hip soundtrack it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset despite an american rating which the content does not justify the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset information on the characters is literally spoon fed to the audience would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us dialogue is poorly written and the plot is extremely predictable the way the film progresses you likely won even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy because you ll know they aren basing the show on 1960 television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand even one that missing finger or two the number of times that checked my watch six is clear indication that this film is not one of them it is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar judging from the rash of really awful teen flicks that we ve been seeing as of late avoid this film at all costs
call it road trip for the walking wounded stellan skarsg rd plays such convincingly zombified drunken loser that it difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly boozed out presence yet this ever reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen sentimental and painfully mundane european drama playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late that an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father tomas skarsg rd and his alienated openly hostile yuppie daughter kaisa lena headey gossip they haven spoken in years and wouldn even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen scotland by automobile if it weren for kaisa mother charlotte rampling under the sand rotting away in hospital bed from cancer in soap opera twist mother has only few days to live only in the movies right too blitzed to even step foot on plane tomas hits the open road with kaisa loathing each other all the while they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out whenever he isn muttering what rotten kid she turned out to be despite his sloshed viewpoint tomas recognizes that the apple hasn fallen very far from the tree kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke sabotages her personal relationships through indifference and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper ain they pair unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one note and repetitively bitchy dialogue screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate series of contrivances to propel events forward lost money roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around nosy cops and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative by the time they reach the hospital it time to unveil the secrets from dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father daughter conflict they re also the mainstays of many bad strindberg wannabe this revelation exists purely for its own sake aberdeen doesn know where else to go weak unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa if lena headey were stronger actress perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody haunting cinematography rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world the reference to certain superior american indie flick intentional headey too busy acting using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance if she were paying any attention to skarsg rd maybe she figure out that doing less can reveal so much more it worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 jonathan nossiter captivating signs wonders it not just because skarsg rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films they re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant in aberdeen rampling is luminous diva preening and static in her hospital bed despite skarsg rd solid performance as tomas his pathetic drunk is never given much of chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow there genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs wonders allowing them to suggest gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity nossiter film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain if signs wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas at least it willing to stretch beyond what we ve come to expect from traditional drama aberdeen is never half so ambitious content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan trite but occasionally useful grand canyon where steve martin hollywood mogul pronounces all of life riddles are answered in the movies even foreign films are taking that advice to heart
best remembered for his understated performance as dr hannibal lecter in michael mann forensics thriller manhunter scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on usually playing bit role in some studio schlock he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight he only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do if you want to see some brilliant acting check out his work as dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach hidden agenda cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge big john feels the love that dares not speak its name but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light he an even tempered funny robust old man who actually listens to the kids problems as opposed to their parents and friends both caught up in the high wire act of their own confused lives he ll have sex for pay with them only after an elaborate courtship charming them with temptations from the grown up world stands for long island expressway which slices through the strip malls and middle class homes of suburbia filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as pretty transparent metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15 year old protagonist howie paul franklin dano in his opening voice over howie reveals morbid preoccupation with death on the road citing the highway deaths of filmmaker alan pakula songwriter harry chapin and his own mother on exit 52 he both fascinated and disturbed by the and those feelings are projected onto big john who follows howie around in his bright kirmizi car but never makes move to force the boy to do something he doesn want to do this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies he beast but ashamed of it would have worked best as half hour short film about howie ill advised foray into big john haven there is unnecessary padding with howie miserable dad bruce altman in the hot seat for white collar crime degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle class houses and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise ass gary terrio billy kay handsome artful dodger rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui not that we needed another movie on that subject these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length concurrently the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted cox sporting baseball cap and faded marine tattoo is all bluff and bluster dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent we re so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious calling haley joel it surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene the restraint is admirable but screenplay doesn always give them the best material when howie reads big john walt whitman poem the moment feels bit too precious director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach goldberg variations it too much there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john other boy toy walter masterson jealous over the newbie this plot thread predictably leads to violence not content to be haunting observational portrait of teen alienation in royally screwed up world like terry zwigoff superb ghost world cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note it typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with bullet sparing the writers from actually having to come up with complex philosophical note in this regard and countless other indie films share something in common with blockbuster action films problems are solved when the obstacle is removed how often does real life work this way to extend the question if movie is striving for realism do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion
snake eyes is the most aggravating kind of movie the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing it not just because this is brian depalma film and since he great director and one who films are always greeted with at least some fanfare and it not even because this was film starring nicolas cage and since he gives brauvara performance this film is hardly worth his talents it worse than that it aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more could be totally intelligent and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half assedness or more deservedly the hall of fame of the eighth assedness in certain circles snake eyes was being advertised as kind of modern day version of kurosawa classic rashomon where crime is told from the four different and mean different perspectives and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening which might add is superb in one very very very long steadicam shot we meet the protagonist crooked atlantic city detective rick santoro cage and follow him before boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife interupts pay per view event on tv chases down gambler enters the arena all pumped up for the fight sits down and talks with his bud kevin dunne gary sinise who character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn who also in this and watches as it happens there big name in the crowd and that the secretary of defense charles kirkland joel fabiani who sitting behind rick and who gets shot second after the heavyweight champion lincoln tyler stan shaw is knocked out this all happens in the opening shot and it creates so many kirmizi herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction what really happened this film asks and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene and discovers there very good possibility it was conspiracy as we follow rick trying to learn of more information we also meet woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot carla gugino and who flees the scene in panic and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness takes on what happened this is all going pretty fine and dandy and it extremely interesting to watch then it takes one wrong step we follow the wrong character and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on and way before rick can find it out but that not the worst part of it it that it the one person you didn think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the kirmizi herring the one you didn think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it it only gets worse the film turns into chase film about half way through the film and since we already know what happened we can rely on rick investigation to be all that interesting it as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about third of the way in and decided to just fall back on an easy way out and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible events become more and more proposterous and by the end the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this the deux ex machina that where some outside intereference brings the film to sudden conclusion and makes everything okay this time it hurricane an out of control police car and big round ball that adorned the arena what went wrong depalma and the screenwriter david koepp are extremely credible people in their respective fields and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this depalma who idolizes hitchcock to death has done many film like this such as his masterpiece blow out where movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover conspiracy piece by piece but granted depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch what with his over the top shot set ups notably the beginning and sequence where the camera pans over top of bunch of rooms in the hotel forgetting anything about boundaries at least his direction makes up partly for it then there koepp who showed such great ability at making character flaws come to life like he did in depalma earlier carlito way film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well he can write flawed character but his rick santoro seems to be just half assed effort he flawed and we can see redemption if the story wasn so formulaic scene towards the end where he has to make fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup he may as well have said the opposite of what he says it would have at least gone with what the character was like this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity because it promises disection of flawed character and perhaps even redemption then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way as was watching the first half hour couldn wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed how many different perspectives he be given and perhaps he have to make choice between who he has to believe now there film unfortunately the film has two major deux ex machinas one in the disasterous ending the other about half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes stale and recycled piece of crap we ve seen all too much before but never from someone like depalma
hong kong cinema has been going through bad spell the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films in nutshell the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership lot of hong kong best talents have crossed the pacific to work on productions such talents as jackie chan rush hour chow yun fat anna the king the corrupter and yuen woo ping the matrix have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai unfortunately romeo must die bears all the trademarks of typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong rhythms the film opens in nightclub as an asian couple is necking enter group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing russell wong kai confronts po sing jon kit lee the son of kai boss and leader of the local chinese family battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai who handily kicks and punches his opponents down it not until club owner silk rapper dmx bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends the following morning po sing is found dead suspicions escalate as issac day delroy lindo is told of the murder his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into legitimate venture issac implores his chief of security mac issiah washington to watch after his son and daughter the scene shifts to prison in china where han sing jet li learns of his brothers murder he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined hung upside down by one foot han recovers and battle his way out of custody in blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work escaping to the han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother death romeo must die is in many ways fun film it is both absurd and assured the basic plot of gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes the godfather the relationship between jet li han and aaliyah trish day reminds us of abel ferrera china girl except that romeo must die couple never once exchange more than loving glance towards one another their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable li of course has the showiest part having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination allayah in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with certain style and grace it obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic but still the part is under written in such way that even poor performance would not have affected it delro lindo as issac day carries himself well in the film an unsung and under appreciated actor mr lindo turns out the films best performance the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for woodside as issac son colin the performance is undirected with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and or better written first time director andrzej bartkowiak does workmanlike job in handling the film having career as one of the industry best cinematographers bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots and romeo must die does look good but the pacing of the film is lethargic only coming to semblance of life during the fight scenes the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of sports center for nfl team is needlessly confusing and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah bodyguard maurice has no comic timing whatsoever the best things about the film are its fight scenes jet li is master of these intricate physical battles one needs only to see his film fist of legend to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat here jet is given the opportunity to show off in way that lethal weapon jet debut didn allow unfortunately lot of jet fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision also romeo must die must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film and that is an ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent obviously homage to the famed ray scene from sonny chiba streetfighter the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film it as if the film has stopped and video game has been inserted one problem though about the fight scenes those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon they do have an internal rhythm to them heartbeat so to speak in their choreography the fight scenes in hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance this is created by the performance the direction and the editing here in romeo must die there is no staccato every fight scene even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows set pattern the rhythm is monotonous hong kong film has tempo that changes heightening its emotional impact rmd is limited to standard tempo not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever fine example of this difference can be found by examining couple of jackie chan films watch the restaurant fight from the film rush hour and notice that the context of the fight while technically amazing is rather flat the framing and cut always do not help now look at the warehouse fight from rumble in the bronx there you have heartbeat and emotional draw that doesn let the audience catch its breath the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted here in romeo must die the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl jet li is grand and personable screen presence it shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here one day filmmakers here in the will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such commodity until then we ll be left with emotionally hollow product like the replacement killer and currently romeo must die
capsule where are you tonight leni rienfenstal starship troopers is an expensive hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography and bad pornography at that it is not good cinema not good storytelling and not even stupid fun it so cynically calculatedly bone headed that even the least demanding members of the audience was with were alternately bored and revulsed it one of the worst movies ve seen in long time why am calling this movie pornography pornography in the abstract is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts remember reading review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper as near pornographic eternity didn agree with that assessment but could see what was being implied the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout do er man do er that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers it literally like giant recruitment film that has gone berserk it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening the film takes place in our future when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn appear to have intelligence to counterattack humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable instead of nuke the planet from orbit which they re clearly capable of they send down grunts with 16 rifles this isn heinlein it bad wwii movie one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy repetitive and ultimately tiresome one scene has journalist on battlefield filimg soldiers being slaughtered and ends with groaning predictability said cameraman gets skewered too the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic they do not possess germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense they don even behave like soldiers in bad movie and therefore we don care about them we hated the tom berenger character in platoon but he mattered and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate here we don even hate the bugs what there to hate hating them would be like cursing hurricaine if there anything really hateful there the movie doesn know how to give it to us the screenwriter ed neumeier perhaps better appelation would be screen typist and director the increasingly talent impaired paul verhoeven have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other one of the subplots concerns woman pilot who great at getting out of tight situations and does it again and again and again once or twice is fine by the fifth or sixth time it worn out its welcome there never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything or really being tested to show their mettle also the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry if bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing damned thing but if one human gets cornered he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip uh huh the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi fascist flavor say quasi because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action the gear the uniforms etc the movie doesn have the nerve or the brains to be genuinely fascist or intelligent about the subject the bumpers between scenes which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison like the rest of the movie there more suppose but it not worth it the acting is bland neither arsenic nor gravy the music disposable the camerawork turgid the heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like masterpiece
this feature is like double header two sets of clich for the price of one not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts but the banal rich girl poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure an original moment in this loser is as rare as chicago cubs world series appearance the screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins based on story by falls merely lobs its plotline at the audience this is story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching summer catch centers around ryan dunne freddie prinze jr cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league supposedly showcase for the best young amateur and college players in the country ryan is blue collar kind of guy he works with his dad taking care of the lawns of cape cod rich and famous he also as we are informed early his own worst enemy he has the potential and the talent but always seems to self destruct at the crucial moment so ryan tries to remained focused on baseball then he meets tenley parrish jessica biel daughter of one of the mavi bloods whose lawn he manicures tenley name only hack screenwriter could invent is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan if you can figure out where all this nonsense leads then you need remedial course in film viewing as always prinze is pretty to look at but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions puppy dog love heartbreak frustration self loathing or determination biel cries lot while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class conscious father the only beacon is matthew lillard fun loving billy brubaker the team catcher summer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies such as bull durham and the natural no curve balls here no sliders every pitch is predictable blind umpire could call this movie summer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking it has as much chance of making the movie hall of fame as the dodgers have of moving back to brooklyn
unfortunately it doesn get much more formulaic than one tough cop there the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film bo dietl pronounced deedle baldwin is one tough cop guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia on top of that problem he has drunk gambling addicted partner penn who has penchant for collecting parking tickets guess cops aren immune then throw into the mix the femme fatale gershon right there you have plenty of ammo for decent cop drama but right in the middle of the film they throw in completely un related plot point dietl and his partner duke try to solve case that they have been warned to stay away from the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of nun who was beaten and raped to near death once the case is solved the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as mafioso an insult if you ask me the performances were pretty good baldwin though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec does fine job as one tough cop penn who also slips into an impression of his brother sean is even better as loser tough guy cop what one tough cop lacks is originality this film offers nothing new nothing that you can get from any cop film it screams sidney lumet all over the place perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman producers of lumet dog day afternoon and serpico but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into good film too much else is lacking also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture something that almost never notice but once saw that had it in the back of my mind every time saw medium or long shot at times was hoping to see it one tough cop isn laughable nor is it terrible film but it just isn unique it is classic example of film that didn need to be made but one thing is for sure it could really use better title
there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs one is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into feature film two is never greenlight sci fi film starring john travolta to wit we present the disaster that is battlefield earth science fiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum security prisons when prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior sci fi is always tricky beast tight script good director an ensemble cast of decent actors and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs battlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes here the `plot the year is 3000 mankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of race of aliens called the psychlos sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or beyaz rap group small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons who dwell in the cities below the psychlos are strip mining the earth for its resources and terel played by travolta is the head of security for the mining slave base located in denver young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler played with dramatic flair by barry pepper ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the `demons he is promptly captured and taken to the alien base after several attempts at escape johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terel involving circumventing altin from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end jonnie assumed leader of the mining slave group then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through learning machine terel forces him to use then the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry the bill of rights how to use machine gun and how to fly harrier jet the whole mess concludes with big loud obnoxious gun and plane battle that had me praying for the end credits roger christian the director of this lumbering beast must have rented dune blade runner planet of the apes independence day stargate beastmaster the airwolf episodes the `v miniseries the matrix and the omega man and decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth christian even shoots every scene in weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie and every scene in the movie ends with middle wipe really the psychlos reminded me of cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit travolta acting hasn been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect jonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like `you can have your freedom if you fight then there the script the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet would be difficult task to achieve why because terel provides all the necessary tools to incite revolt for no particular reason beside the fact that `humans are stupid terel may be right you know humans made this movie
note to screenwriters and self when you hit the big time and the studios come knocking for those scripts that are sitting in your bottom drawer tell em all to hit the road gilligan wrote the arbitrarily titled home fries ten years ago it was shelved until he found success as one of the took second look at gilligan comedy they read it again wearing rose tinted glasses drew stars as sally dim but sweet pregnant waitress at small town burger joint located somewhere in the southern united states the father of her child is dead the victim of severe heart attack brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons these flyboys scared him with their low flying helicopter dorian wilson and angus busey were getting even for his philandering ways on behalf of their anguished mother hara trouble is sally picked up some interference on her drive thru headset and angus worries she may have heard conversations that took place in the helicopter prior to the accidental killing so dorian goes undercover as burger flipper before you can say with cheese he falls for the mother to be too bad mom and angus have homicidal plans for sally does this sound like movie you want to see without doubt the best thing about home fries is barrymore at the risk of sounding sexist she never looked better than here as curly redhead with twinkling eyes she is winning in role that requires her to do absolutely nothing except look apple cheek cute and gawk at wilson her real life boyfriend but the plot and the situations are so off putting that nothing could save it this movie desperately wants to get mentioned in the same breath as the coen brothers but home fries brand of laboured hipness would be foreign to geniuses like ethan and joel it raising arizona without babies without charm without laughs without human characters and without intelligence worst of all it creepy what funny about threatening to gun down pregnant woman with machine gun unless the woman in question is spice girl take out the helicopters the quasi incestuous relationship between the mother and her sons it is absolutely illogical within the movie framework that dorian still lives with his mother and brother and the scenes of murder attempted and otherwise and what are you left with the story of single woman with child who works at fast food joint but dreams of becoming country singer that could turn out to be the most boring movie ever made but it be better than home fries
susan granger review of the watcher universal just what we need another lurid trashy serial killer saga this time keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in gruesome ticking clock cat and mouse game with james spader burnt out fbi agent who has suffered traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd to taunt spader who has relocated to chicago reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too before long he starts mailing photographs of the lonely unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims challenging spader along with the chicago police department to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again in the midst of this murderous frenzy there spader psychologist played by marisa tomei who is even less convincing as medical professional than jennifer lopez in the cell writers david elliot clay ayers and darcy meyers along with first time director joe charbanic helmer of music videos for reeves band dogstar dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase revealing early on exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop need each other to give meaning to our lives plus as reeves explains we re all stacked right on top of each other but we don notice each other any more after that it all sound effects and tricky camera work along with muddled discordant soundtrack james spader acting technique can be described as wooden deadpan while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone dude persona which sometimes works sometimes doesn chris ellis as spader self important colleague is the only cast member who manages to be convincing on the granger movie gauge of to 10 the watcher is an appallingly awful amateurish the real torture is watching it
tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie the film which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states is based on 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage and while it evident that this could be fascinating live production the translation to the screen is creative disaster enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through filmed version of performance art lifeless and tedious the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium tectonic plates has storyline although the narrative is developed in decidedly non traditional fashion with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences it not an inherently uninteresting way to present movie despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious all but screaming look art although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters because we re constantly made aware that we re watching play or movie it impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer ideas they re not real sympathetic or believable willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different but this particular experiment is not success tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine marie gignac an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor jacques lapage one day he disappears and fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love madeleine travels to venice to kill herself while preparing to commit suicide she encounters drug addict constance celine bonnier who causes madeleine to re think her decision meanwhile jacques has moved to new york city where he starts cross dressing calls himself jennifer and becomes successful counter culture talkshow host with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland supporting characters that include topless goddess and deaf mute and cultural references that point to chopin george sand and jim morrison tectonic plates is unique if nothing else however as interesting as the film sounds and was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising it never really delivers the tone is soporific the supposedly intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting the plot meanders in pointless and irritating manner although it doesn take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant and the symbolism is obvious tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth but it takes one hundred minutes to get across this transparent point there are some worthwhile moments such as silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren bilingual the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because it different it not like anything they ve seen before and it pretentious for everyone else it not only waste of time but poor introduction to the work of robert lapage

when respecting director you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect woody allen has made couple less than good films and he my favorite even martin scorsese hasn had perfect track record kevin smith after smashing debut with the classic clerks stooped as low to sell out and make the dreadful mallrats mean so far the only director who made several films none of which have been bad is richard linklater slacker dazed and confused before sunrise and suburbia all which were great now adore quentin tarantino his first two films were classic films the second one being one of the greatest films of all time but 1995 just wasn that good of year for him he made way too many tv appearances he mispronounced jackie chan name on the mtv movie awards and he made this film he was also awarded an oscar so guess that would be grand exception robert rodriguez is also great director not brilliant one but cool one ve never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film so can comment on them but in this crap ensemble director film all four give pitiful efforts pitiful for any director too now in all fairness ensemble director pieces never really work out ve never seen all of new york stories but have heard the first two films by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap saw woody one which was hilarious but not totally up to par but will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film exposition simple one bellhop ted the totally overdone tim roth who god and all but not in this one though he has couple good moments is working on new year eve for his first shift in an old fancy hotel he the only one there again and he only has couple rooms yet again the old bellhop the seemingly immortal marc lawrence who hated pulp fiction actually hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily as the night goes on he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile yea the short films are presented in order btw the missing ingredient writer director allison anders starring sammi davis amanda decadenet valeria golino madonna ione skye lili taylor alicia witt this one starts it off horribly with no plot no intrigue and crap dialogue the situation is so terrible that it physically painful to watch the plot has something to do with coven of witches needing sperm to bring back godess who is gasp stuck inside some object in their hotel room the witch that was supposed to bring it ione skye calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it yeah that what said stupid plot inane characters who aren interesting at all etc etc etc the only good thing about this is it has good cast which in turn it wastes pitifully not even actually funny for second my rating out of no stars the wrong man writer director alexandre rockwell starring david proval jennifer beals and laurence bender another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of couple david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at coming back who are playing sex games ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon but at least this has bit of comedy in it just not that much and david proval has never overacted as much and it pulp fiction producer laurence bender who gets to puke from window masterpiece compared to the first one but still the misbehavers writer director robert rodriguez starring antonio banderes tamlyn tomita lana mckissack danny verduzco salma hayek would robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek navel nope luckily she on the tv dancing so we get to see her surprisingly enough when read the screenplay about year before actually seeing it this one seemed to have the most potential it was fast paced funny and well funny but when watched it it seemed anti climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once antonio overacts nicely and the two kids lana and danny are funny but as said it moves slowly and in that way it more painful than funny but the ending was stupid and funny at the same time oh the plot antonio is supposed gangster assumed really who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife tomita go out to get drunk at new year party antonio hires ted for couple bucks to watch his kids all night long but things go wrong it was okay the man from hollywood writer director quentin tarantino starring quentin tarantino bruce willis paul calderon and jennifer beals again ironically this one could be considered the best for bad reason it best represents what quentin has done with this film he plays chester spoiled brat actor or something who has just had huge box office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti climactic game from hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in row they re drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn light they also pay him lot of cash this is so much exactly what this little film is about that it campy tim roth was probably payed lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by bunch of people who are high on themselves cause they ve had hits major or minor it took quentin to realize that but the thing is it doesn seem like he realizes that if he did give this good stars but this sucked it was anti climactic and the dialogue wasn very good he starts off with very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes that makes no sense it cool for while then he makes it uneven it long and it just not very good hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one conclusion what the moral here if you ve made celebrated films don do an ensemble piece they should have re watched new york stories and then stopped in their tracks none of these have any point to them and they re embarrassing to not only the writer directors but to the actors cause they re working with crap but will forgive everyone involved and especially look forward to quentin next directing job even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool from dusk till dawn which found exhilerating love quentin and suppose it good he made the man from hollywood because it makes him seem more realistic and not some god of cinema seem to respect directors if they aren gods and are actually human beings who make mistakes the man from hollywood is his big mistake and let hope he doesn return her continuously
plot based on the wildly popular jerry springer tv show this movie follows the lives of two groups of people before they make their bizarre appearances on the infamous program one posse comes from the trailer parks and are to be featured in the slept with my stepfather segment and the other is based on some fly girl whose girlfriends keep sleeping with her undevoted dog boyfriend critique the truth is that if didn have day job would probably watch the real jerry springer show every day find it quite entertaining despite its complete lack of redeeming value having said that the show itself is outrageous funny and always filled with goofy surprises as opposed to this film which features no laughs is this comedy or drama uninteresting and completely unbelievable one dimensional stereotypes and contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way never thought would utter the word boring in the same sentence as jerry springer but this film is an absolute yawn fest despite offering various scenes featuring simulated blowjobs lesbians t&a and tv violence who would ve guessed that wish they would have either made this movie much much funnier or turned it into complete drama and given us real perspective as to why people like this actually put themselves through these public forums of embarrassment unfortunately it doesn seem as though screenwriter jon bernstein spent more than drunken weekend watching real jerry springer reruns to complete his script leaving us with boring film featuring no laughs one dimensional characters and no fun whatsoever little known facts about this film and its stars jerry springer used to be the mayor of cincinnati ohio for this film he won the 1999 razzie award for worst new star tied with joe esterhas from an alan smithee film burn hollywood burn
the last line or near to that honor is the great butler alfred the ubergod michael gough saying think we need bigger bat cave or something to that note that exactly what this film is too big for its own good because it has too damn much cut batgirl out cut one of the villains it too much to handle in one dosage it so much that characters get left behind poor elle gets mere scenes and subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way shape or form and elle deserves better this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher it also the fourth worst in the series and second worst from joel the series has been declining since its stunning debut followed by the almost as stunning sequel and then the anti climactic third one first by joel this one not anti climactic knew it was gonna suck it up to joel to make it fun though batman forever was fun this is big bore of over produced action sequences and shallow characters mean this one bit gonna put all the plot in one paragraph mr freeze ah nold who wife was dying of some disease has become the new big villain these days he huge ex scientist who fell into some weird liquid hello joker and now has body temperature of big fat zero and has mavi body batman george and robin chris fight him bit but find they re growing apart meanwhile another villain shows up poison ivy uma who was dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with twistet scientist john glover who kills her when she finds out he used her research to develop an uberman bane who is basically man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had she emerges from her chemicals don ask cause can tell ya as sexy woman the real uma who poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo meanwhile alfred dying of the same disease mr freeze wife has but in an earlier state than she and his niece barbara alicia comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade but soon well not really soon it takes her hours becomes batgirl meanwhile in an unfinished subplot bruce batman alter ego if you forgot has been dating the lovely julie madison the even lovlier elle macpherson who wants commitment after year but he says nothing end of her for all we know mr freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population don ask the trio must team together as family to beat them there ya go not the whole story but no big context clues too much right right the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for couple good sequels however while tim burton nicely balanced the villain batman storyline although not wonderfully joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one he gets some corny speeches couple clever lines and that it maybe some stunts for all this can even comment on george clooney as batman hardly saw the guy and when did he had horrible dialogue to say think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode george is in between them he not quintessential he not horrible he good but sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they ll be critically murdered for this sorry effort we ll get good script and clooney will shine if he still has the job the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher last time we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey this time we have somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain the same guy mr freeze we feel bad for his mental physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants arnold isn very good too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points when he watches old movies of his wife he actually looks somber wow but uma makes the most of her seductive character getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness it like she almost parodying herself in pulp fiction at points she incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much star better as for the lower bat people chris is the same as he was in batman forever although think his work in these is too hokey when he best at quieter parts in scent of woman or just plain cool parts in fried green tomotoes alicia love the girl but she not particularly good in this film she can hypotheitically act we all saw that in clueless but her lines kinda sound weird and it isn the mushy mouth this time but in all fairness she has virtually no part joel gets around to her occasionally and when she on she does stupid stuff although know not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma and poor elle poor poor elle love that woman and she can also hypothetically act for those of us who saw sirens but she has no part it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product there are no couch scenes like my best friend noticed now listen to me on this one in every batman flick there couch scene in the original it was with vicki in returns it was good make out scene with selena and in the last one it was chat with nicole this one it nothing and batgirl does next to nothing in this film till the end when she suddenly part of the family fortunately we get lot of alfred he the always reliable butler in case you didn know who has been with bruce all his life he god he father figure he also dying this got to me love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in robe not in his tux and freaking dying just gets to me we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time but this is never answered as this film is too cluttered but in defense it does have some good parts other than uma for one george is good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do and there are some nice touches when they show the asylum at one point they show the patient belongings in room and we see the riddler costume laughed and during biker scene involving robin and batgirl another subplot never handled past initiation period we not only see coolio but bunch of bad asses dressed as droogs from clockwork orange laughed at all these the film falls apart around the five minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes or did it just feel like that the film should serve as another in the long line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays people are fed up with stupid films that why the word of mouth killed the lost world that why last year indy films grossed more than ever that why this will have strong box office initative from people who just want to see it like me but will die after week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it that why the next two big budget aciton pics are john woo face off and barry sonnenfeld men in siyah both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on like joel schumacher more as person than an artiste like some of his films flatliners time to kill but lot of them suck he really eccentric person and loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being mediocre director and that what makes him great but his costuming for woody allen sleeper was more interesting than this one and his costuming was cool look for the nazi number love the batman series the first two rocked and did like the last one but this one is not going to be one that watch repeatedly like the other three hopefully this will also serve as springboard to better batman next time and maybe they ll get smart and bring back catwoman and michael keaton but we can only hope
writers dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer starring jamie lee curtis william baldwin donald sutherland joanna pacula sherman augustus marshall bell cliff curtis julio oscar mechoso suppose not extremely surprised that virus comes to us from deciple of james cameron john bruno and if strain real hard could even say that it an obvious given particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr cameron early works in fact virus is yet another in the long line of action horror paranoia thrillers from the aliens vein group of people are dropped into mysterious situation only to find mortally threatening entity is out to get them textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies and maybe even to the first pictures albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future no such thing will happen to bruno whom believe worked in some capacity on that quasi landmark feature while bruno may have studied under cameron wing for years and years beginning to wonder at what capacity and what exactly did he learn from him in fact virus should at least be mediocre the fact that bruno could have worked under man like cameron director who if anything just knows how to make movie and then make film like virus is just another detraction fairly aimed at this grade schlockfest of film albeit grade schlockfest with respectable budget the film seems to not only borrow it plot from last year similarly fated deep rising but also from clunkish movie from the 80s called leviathan an underwater thriller starring peter weller richard crenna hector elizando and daniel stern about group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part alien part john carpenter twisted remake of the thing virus again has similar uh selling point group of sailors on boat stumble upon russian cruiser that is dead in the water they get on they break up into pairs and investigate and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy has taken over all the machines on board have meshed the machines with parts from corpses and have deemed humankind their enemy because of misquote in the dictionary ha ha not that any of this is for second scary or the least bit involving not only does this film start off with chintzy bond ian opening the destruction of the cruiser via satellite transmission from mir destroying any of the suspense in what could happen but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters of its motley crew it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters lead woman skipper masculine potential romantic interest drunken captain siyah technician tatooed aborigine manic russian survivor and couple other candidates for alien food none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than thin plain piece of writing paper and it not the traditional argument for films like these where you may in fact want them all to be eaten even aliens played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers but this was more of plus side for the film as whole than the opposite instead as another cliche goes you just don give damn almost don even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub par to horrific the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what strong female lead she is and she is just not really here and the latter being and it pains me to say this as he particular favorite of mine donald sutherland who plays the captain so poorly and without second of credibility that this will go down as the performance of which he should be ashamed like anthony hopkins for legends of the fall the line scrooooooo em has been thus embroidered upon my membrance or peter toole in caligula great actor horrific performance it happens every now and then and it only helps sutherland career that no one except for an elite few even bothered to see this film though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can read early january when everyone still trying to catch up on the potential oscar nominees it does show that universal shelled out pretty penny to make this film it laden with complex machinery boasts respectable production design and it may even feature believable special effects if of course or anyone else could see them virus mostly takes place on large abandoned cruiser and mostly at night until the dawn and mostly without the use of lights not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey but more so because as the hollywood cliche seems to go if it dark enough then the special effects will be more believable and if you don believe me go back and rent godzilla and tell me if there even one shot where we see godzilla either in his entirety in one wide shot or the light so that we can at least see him well you don really have to sit through it again just take my word for it but all of this doesn matter since virus is basically just one loud cluttered mess of movie the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie ve ever seen my um favorite part was the scene where trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship during five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves rain and any other ocean extremeties the film can cook up then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned well must say thanks for telling me afterwards because sure couldn figure it out when saw it imagine the first attack of the aliens in aliens shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity and that basically the whole of virus one horribly directed action scene after the other capping it off with proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least couple of the original cast members and my god it long damn sit with no interesting characters no dramatic urgency no tension not one good moment of action and no mesmerizing visuals it wonder that it even got made we already know that big movie studios mentality is shallow at best and movies like out of sight and saving private ryan give you more faith in them but movies like virus manage to drain little more out of the pool almost wish that instead of making this movie john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film green light they read the script they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into director who might have very well been cameron hack and he is and they still went ahead with the project only to have bruno and company shit back in their face even though hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie say even more contempt should be aimed at mr bruno for making movie that could be this bad in fact

there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space it just that none of them happen to be actors the stars referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie outer space the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home yes in terms of acting the star power is well more like falling star kinda pretty short lived and pretty much dead lost in space as if you really didn know is based on the 60 sci fi television series of the same name it the year 2058 and earth precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population john robinson william hurt is the scientist leading mission program to colonize foreign planet earth entire existance is contingent upon successful mission but nobody whether it be john family or hired battle pilot don west matt leblanc seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years john family consists of his wife maureen mimi rogers his atypical teenage daughter penny lacey chabert his ingenious son will jack johnson and his beautiful scientist daughter judy heather graham despite everyone reluctance the jupiter spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space unknown to anyone but the audience there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission dr smith gary oldman has been hired by group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour and dr smith has re programmed talking robot to destroy robinson family when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination and now the premise of being lost in space is complete as for the audience you will likely be lost in boredom by this point wondering if the plot like the jupiter will ever get off the ground it hard to tell who deserves the most blame the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script chabert is basically the only one to overdo it sounding like whiny munchkin on helium if you like me were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens you re wrong that just her normal voice in yet another example of friend faltering on the big screen leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming make sense it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod graham is babe thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film hurt the siyah hole of excitement sucks up any energy that might have been left if hurt were available in tablet form he would be prescription strength sleeping pill johnson isn dull he just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody ass all the time want an example of how cool this kid can be how about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family hey don laugh the thing actually listened to the mr rogers would be proud sentiment but alas if you thought character couldn be much worse there was rogers as the epitome of generic or mother as she was known why hire an actress they could ve had beyaz cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it now that would ve had some pizzazz lost in space luckily doesn suffer in every single category that it could have the special effects are crisp clear and at least mildly captivating unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman who plays his evil character with great deal of fun and finesse unfortunately oldman is locked away for most of the film giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy while the special effects are pleasing to the eye they are nothing you couldn find in most modern sci fi films contact for example far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered work of cinematic art with numerous contradictions the time travel aspect was horribly flawed wooden and corny acting worse dialogue and an ending so disappointing you be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens then again with an ending like this film has it obvious sequel is already being considered what an awful note to end on knowing there could be more of this in year or two the attempt to be family oriented is commendable but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups well danger potential movie goers danger this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity
except for few bright moments of good verbal comedy that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through bette midler and dennis farina play lilly and dan actress and author once married now violently divorced and back together one last time for their daughter molly paula marshall wedding lilly and dan hate each other passionately so passionately that they have sex at the wedding and fall in love again each ditches his or her current spouse of 14 years and runs off with the other molly married now only 24 hours runs off in search of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith jamie denton tries to console the abandoned spouses in molly search for her parents she somehow falls in love with lilly paparazzo joey danny nucci meanwhile the newlywed keith ends up consoling dan wife rowena gail grady in bed the audience saw this with apparently thought that all the adultery was hilarious no dan quayle but thought it was bit creepy the message seemed to be ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and have fun fucking who you wish family values aside there something cruel about all this perhaps this movie would have played well as siyah comedy but the movie is romantic comedy we are supposed to be rooting for these creeps reiner and screenwriter leslie dixon tried to make it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable lilly husband is new age flake who rambles about emotional valet parking so we can write him off as irrelevant dan wife is vain manipulative and jealous so we can write her off as bitch molly husband is career conscious self centered republican politician who thinks she too fat and just for good measure he also fucked dan wife so we can write him off as prick everyone else falls in love but still that somehow doesn justify the actions of the movie main characters he prick or she bitch is no defense the movie is somewhat redeemed by some funny dialog often during heated arguments and by above average performances by midler and farina breaking out of his character actor mold other than that it standard romantic comedy with very substandard gimmick
watching the movie vowed to subtract half star from the review because the filmmakers included saccharine syrup cute cuddly computer generated monkey if the monkey died the movie got an extra half star alas the monkey showed up at the end unharmed to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs what that means is that lost in space actually deserved stars that pretty generous considering the movie camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek when will robinson jack johnson teaches his pet robot about friendship you are actually supposed to buy it so why such seemingly high rating there are few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage first we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of brand new theater the sound and screen kicked ass nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did and don necessarily mean that in good way also there were more than zero scenes where found myself rooting for the robinsons or getting caught up in the movie tension even liked the computer generated settings usually prefer to see models or sets but the cg was more detailed than ve seen in lot of movies it looks like someone spent little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities also gary oldman is never bad actor even though he is typecast as villain william hurt isn too bad either neither actor had great role but their performances were watchable and perhaps shouldn admit this but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood there is very little swearing or blood there is strong moral message saccharine though it is there is bit of romance whose culmination after hours is real kiss no sex it felt like one of those disney movies that so looked forward to when was six those movies were probably as bad as lost in space but at the time they were manna from heaven that type of moviemaking is lost art now for the bad news worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue it squeaky clean family fun trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction you better hold on to your joystick is one such line and when robinson is called upon to deliver line about warp conduit thingamajigs they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign second worst and closely related is the screenplay the story exposition takes place at press conference which allows the writers to explain what happening with the least amount of creativity effort or interest once the story gets going do concede momentary burst of interest once in while but on the whole the situations that arise are silly and contrived when gary oldman easily reprograms will pet robot to kill the robinsons my friend summed it up perfectly he flipped the switch to evil then there the tone of the movie the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson then it could be an adventure movie they re mostly right except that johnson will wasn good enough actor to carry it off still that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows lack of imagination just because movie is tame enough for kids doesn mean that we have to bow to promise keepers notion of who the center of family many quality family films have been made with non traditional family structure fly away home comes to mind to much better effect and the politics of the time seem bit conservative and regressive for futuristic movie in star wars the rebels were the good guys we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system in lost in space the rebels are the bad guys terrorist force that must be killed crushed and silenced so that our children may live free that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists finally few specific details deserve criticism the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 why why bother saying what year this is just tell us it the future bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 setting specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won be timeless not that this movie was really in the running anyway then there is scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on chair that rises about fifteen feet on pole this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny barber chair and only shows that the future is time when spaceship designers haven learned thing about ergonomics one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed it made lost in space look cool the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and out of context made it sound hip this is overlaid on cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie but if that the best part of the movie can in good conscience recommend it still if you get stuck seeing it as we did you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance think of liking bad movies as child and bring along your bad movie bingo cards
hello kids today the movie studios want to take over my critical review and somehow persuade you that _armageddon_ the summer biggest blockbuster is film for everybody and remember if film is for _everybody_ and if it makes the most money for the summer it _must_ be good right armageddon is comedy with capital it stars bruce willis who has hundred one liners it has tiny rock land directly in the middle of heated argument in new york city and chuckle chuckle one of those new yorkers _survives_ with charcoal all over his face snorkle sniff hiccup and it has steve buscemi as _genius_ who wants to work for an oil rig knee slap isn this just so so funny armageddon also has romance with capital it has tender moment between forbidden lovers ben affleck and liv tyler with with animal crackers and it has will patton as long lost husband trying to reunite with his separated wife and child who thinks he salesman gurgle sniff awwwww and it has steve buscemi spewing more one liners about minors and strippers umm moving right along armageddon also has lots of action with capital not just any action sequence would do it must have _original_ action sequences that are designed to thrill like drill darn it drill and let have inept people destroy the mir space station can you hear your heart beating and steve buscemi goes crazy and starts shooting at people what drama lastly armageddon is out there to save the planet with capital this can be any old thriller we must have an asteroid the size of texas head straight for earth and and we must have beautiful scenic worldwide shots like paris blown up and and we must have peoples of all colors nations and religions join hand in hand for one final hopeful hug the final sequence where muslims in prostrate worship stand up in domino fashion to cheer the victory filled me with such emotional goo that wanted to to to rip the screen into shreds mean mean cheer for ecstatic joy it was over comedy romance action planet okay kids what does that spell seriously folks any film that could take the indie films most valuable talents and throw it all away with bruce willis vehicle hundred million dollar budget but have cheap sets and lousy special effects is bottom line living proof that hell exists and has made multi picture deal with universal in the midst of all the action the terseness the one liners the fake sets the overall waste of time recognized matt malloy playing an underwritten nasa technician malloy give me reading remember him he was principal player in last year _in the company of men_ film that was more powerful shocking terrifying funny and shocking than _armageddon_ could ever aspire to be _armageddon_ cost over $100 million to make _itcom_ cost paltry $30 000 need say more
houston we have serious problem after making mission impossible brian de palma has lot to live up to by making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew he hopes to reach the modern audience and the possibilities are certainly there but the result is great disaster starting in near future with prologue copied from apollo 13 de palma slowly builds up his story the human race has already set foot on mars research expedition has vanished without trace on the kirmizi planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened this is basically the whole plot so it hard to imagine that it can be stretched to hours but de palma manages to do that it is not very good achievement as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space the hardest thing to do is stay awake the film major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is david mamet dialogue while trying to seem natural is distant and simply fake de palma and mamet wanted to combine action with thought provoking plot the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick 2001 space odyssey apollo 13 and godzilla to make time pass the creators have inserted several refreshing scientific details that would not convince half crazed frog it consists of multiple copies and direct ripp offs from several great science fiction films and stories when it finally presents an almost original idea it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity can even call this film predictable since no one with healthy imagination can come up with something like this sometimes it gets so cheesy that you ll start laughing when you re supposed to cry and cry when you re supposed to laugh you ll see enormous sandstorms hear mysterious sounds and last but not least on this constantly surprising tour you ll see an alien it really hard to find comparisons to such an experience and know that ve never said that before thought never would but lost in space is actually better that an achievement in itself director brian de palma has stroke altin with untouchables that became an instant american classic it is for this film that he will be remembered while all his other failures will be forgotten he ll live to fight another day send the actors my condolences since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped and dull characters and both the cinematography production design and art direction are very decent it is because of the achievement of 254 people that rate this film 10 unfortunately their hard work was in vain if you have problems with insomnia recommend you this film if you re not asleep within the first half hour consult your doctor
last summer feature length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of unanimous critical panning based on the famous 60 television show the film was an enormous box office flop and huge disappointment for warner bros year later the studio is up to their old tricks again with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild wild west but it sounded promising the same tag team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld who both contributed to make men in siyah such financial success is at the reins again and co star kevin kline is attached to the project as well as substantial budget to spice up the special effects mean what could possibly go wrong the answer is just about everything wild wild west is cinematic abomination film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given proper chance to get out of the gate there are lot of fancy special effects and handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make lasting impression but the script is so deliriously uneven the entire movie so off course that no human being or technical achievement has chance to salvage it at square one we have bizarre case of casting will smith plays james west renegade cowboy who was originally played by beyaz actor robert conrad in the tv series my guess regarding the casting of african american smith is simple one the actor cozy summertime release big bucks for all those involved smith is very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material but this is not an ideal role for him he too much of joker heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role and frankly that sounds lot more plausible what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self assurance in his eyes you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be huge hit at the summer box office the plot involves west and cross dressing government agent artemus gordon kevin kline who are assigned by the president to recover group of kidnapped scientists the trail leads to the diabolical dr arliss loveless kenneth branagh man with no lower body who speaks in dry witty southern accent loveless has taken the country top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns one such weapon is an 80 foot mechanical tarantula bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular seamlessly blending computer generated imagery with the western surroundings unfortunately all of these effects seem so detached from the story and can do little to support the film plot deficiencies which are undoubtedly the main problem wild wild west is running gag that never truly works most of the jokes usually care of smith die on arrival if it one thing that could possibly be the saving grace it the performances and even they are mostly off kilter and poorly delivered kline is admirable but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest because she is viewed as little more than that window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon branagh an esteemed shakespearean actor and director adds marginal enjoyment to the film but even he is so utterly weird and over the top rarely is film so lost in itself as wild wild west is suppose there always one turkey of the summer season highly anticipated big budget release that manages to completely disappoint wild wild west is such movie and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office perhaps after this audiences will be less assured when they see will smith name stamped on summer movie after such hits as independence day and mib wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume
at times you think edtv would be an entertaining film mean who can resist the story of your average joe becomming celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day but this average joe ed perkuny matthew mcconaughay is sappy lifeless creation that wanders around trying to solve everyone problems and settle his own mcconaughay is awful especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with week beard and torn jeans frankly he had more charm in the devestating flop the newton boys he overacts in every way his overexaggerant body language obsession with kissing women every second he gets the chance and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life and drops to his knee and cries the rest of the cast is very good especially martin landau as ed step father who plays cute role as the close to death old guy that makes all the witty comments jenna elfman is good but little overemotional her main problem is that she keeps getting sucked into bad films can hardly wait and krippendorf tribe woody harrelson as ed brother ray does his usual egg headed role with his comic wit as well he wrote book entitled my brother pissed on me elizabeth hurley is perfectly cast as the easy slut and dennis hopper in quick cameo as ed biological father is nice choice ironically coming after the role he turned down as christof in the truman show ellen degeneres stood out as the executive who after awhile decides the show must not go on much to the opposite of the head exec rob reiner opinion hate to compare this film to the truman show but the fact is was ashamed to see this movie it felt that had dropped from college to kindergarten after seeing truman and ed edtv had no real wit or genius it was typical hollywood extracting the tv part of the movie you have the simple plotline man steals brother girlfriend girlfriend leaves town man gets new slut girlfriend to feel like he can move on slut breaks up with him real girlfriend comes back and voila you have romance got so restless during this movie almost walked out the only reason it doesn drop below grade is because of the fine supporting performances ad2am almost lost my nose and like it like breathing through it jack nicholson chinatown
carry on at your convenience is all about the goings on in the factory of toilet manufacturer wc boggs kenneth williams once they have won an order to manufacture 1000 bidets in two months and charles coote charles hawtrey has designed suitable model the factory employees set to work but are interrupted by union representative vic spanner kenneth cope and friend bernie hulke bernard bresslaw who call them out on strikes on the slightest pretext meanwhile chief foreman sid plummer sid james is growing tired of his wife beattie hattie jacques and her budgie he would much rather live next door with fellow boggs worker chloe moore joan sims but once he discovers that the budgie can predict the winners of horse races he is over the moon and flush with money his daughter myrtle plummer jacki piper is going out with wc son lewis boggs richard callaghan and this causes conflict on the staff day out to the seaside when vic spanner vies for her attentions in the end if the strike does not cease boggs will have to close down his factory but the support of group of women led by coote wife to be and spanner mother agatha spanner renee houston try to resolve the situation also sid realises that his budgie has caused him nothing but trouble since it started predicting horse race winners there are some good performances as usual from sid james and kenneth williams in their standard roles charles hawtrey is third billing but only appears in few scenes his part is mildly amusing richard callaghan is appealing as bogg stuck up son patsy rowlands is funny as miss withering bogg assistant and renee houston is terrific in her small part as agatha however sole acting honours go to hattie jacques as beattie plummer although her character is not directly involved with the main storyline she manages to input great deal of pathos and feeling into her character marvellous performance from marvellous actress the film suffers from annoying performances by bernard bresslaw and especially kenneth cope in his carry on debut cope overdoes his role as spanner making him so annoying as to be unfunny joan sims returns as the love interest instead of barbara windsor sims usual part as the downtrodden wife was taken by hattie jacques additionally bill maynard as fred moore is very poor this carry on movie tries it best to entertain the viewer the locations and wealth of characters are appealing however the toilet humour becomes tiresome very quickly and some of the performances leave lot to be desired this movie does not know where it is going it was made in 1971 and talbot rothwell the scriptwriter seems to be in two minds whether to go for bluer jokes or to maintain the innocent jokes success of most of its predecessors that is why this film suffers minor carry on film whose major asset is the performance by hattie jacques the new minor regulars such as callaghan and piper are not able to enliven the movie and the toilet humour becomes humourless after while
here something to chew on what the favorite food of big cheesy looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of luxury liner in deep rising the obvious answer to this question is cardboard because that the depth of the most fully developed character in this painfully generic creature feature deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by computer in fact considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas perhaps it was the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh both human and non human been scattered in all directions we learn some bloody trivia as well such as how sea monster spraypaints in kirmizi it drinks human being then spits out the liquefied remains and what it does with half digested leftovers suppose deep rising gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre but it doesn do much for me on the surface and that about the only level at which this film can be analyzed deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens titanic connection since james cameron directed both in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue in cheek mayhem of tremors deep rising somehow misses both marks by wide margin the film is not humorous tense or exciting in fact it downright boring and despite being half the length of cameron current box office champ deep rising feels like the longer movie is it really necessary to say anything about the plot probably not since it easy to guess but ll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants synopsis the film opens by introducing us to gang of bad guys on board mercenary ship in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics there finnegan treat williams the boat pilot who supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff joey kevin connor the inept sidekick who supposed to be lovable and funny but is really just irritating and hanover wes studi the mastermind and use that term lightly of the operation their goal attack cruise ship clean out the safe then sink it using some illegally acquired torpedoes the problem is by the time they reach the argonautica the titanic like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste aside from beautiful jewel thief famke janssen and couple of crew members there no one on board the reason soon becomes obvious the ship has been taken over by bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles the cast which is led by treat williams is primarily comprised of has beens and probably never will bes two exceptions wes studi best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans and djimon hounsou amistad cinque williams once can miss prospect in hollywood has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for lead role is film like deep rising and his inability to create charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career famke janssen who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye is the perfect bland match for williams given her limited acting abilities it likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes unfortunately bra defeats the purpose of having her in wet tee shirt for half of the picture meanwhile kevin connor who has entirely too much screen time exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching blackboard these days audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer generated special effects this is lesson that writer director stephen sommers who previously helmed the live action jungle book needs to learn the days of jurassic park when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen are past now movie goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic visuals that are so well incorporated that it impossible to tell where they end and where reality begins in deep rising the monster like everything is artificial and unconvincing unfortunately the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre although to be fair deep rising is particularly bad entry even once this film has sunk out of sight the knowledgeable viewer knows it won be the last of its kind like the slimy slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies more are waiting just around the corner in ambush and that consideration unlike anything on screen is truly horrifying
drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl outside the one who the awkward klutz or the spunky do it yourselfer the one who just doesn fit in with the others she has perfected these characters in movies such as the wedding singer and most notably ever after now she back starring in what could be called modern day cinderella fable never been kissed you know it fable because she plays copy editor at newspaper who has her own office as well as secretary trust me on this one no copy editor has seen the inside of private office since gutenberg and don mean steve invented the printing press the premise is simple barrymore josie geller at 25 the youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago sun times is assigned to go undercover and return to high school to do an expose on what today teens are feeling and doing josie she says she was named after the 70s cartoon character was geek in high school so she jumps at the opportunity for second chance this time she thinks she will get it right and be accepted by the in crowd now what kind of adult with good job and successful career would actually look forward to reliving the hell that was and is high school and adolescence these are among the many problems that plague never been kissed screenwriters abby kohn and marc silverstein cannot get handle of josie their script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy blubbering woman child at the least provocation and the fact that an adult would put so much stock into trying to become tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly south glen high school most popular girls leads you to question her maturity and mental stability ok so never been kissed is not sociological expose of today high school scene however certain rules should apply to film and one of those is consistency of character among the movie problems is the ill conceived conceit that josie would seriously strive to climb the high school food chain and in the process lose focus on her assignment any competent editor would have tossed her ass out the door quicker than you could say get me rewrite to be fair barrymore is very appealing but she is given very little to work with she tries valiantly to get firm grip on her character but the script continually undermines her barrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of the script in which she tries to walk talk and act like cool hip high schooler otherwise she is left foundering on cliched sea of teen age stereotypes and situations never been kissed is entertaining and funny in fits and starts it lacks consistency and firm grasp on what it wants to accomplish the movie main bright spot is provided by leelee sobieski as aldys the outsider who befriends new student josie josie sees lot of her former self in aldys yet still abandons her to hang out with the popular girls real mature and that is the main deficiency with never been kissed it illogical unrealistic uneven and undemanding it has some warm and humorous spots but not enough to overcome its many obstacles
plot rich psychiatrist with great home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped by some bad guys who want him to extract some information from the mind of one of his nutty patients of course the patient is not cooperative and the doctor only has few hours to comply with their demands before they kill his daughter pretty good premise no critique if you re not fan of movies packed with plot holes inconsistencies and yes even more plot holes heed my words and skip this hollow thriller and don like saying that either since this film actually had some potential and started off pretty well sure the story is basically just an amalgamation of ransom primal fear and nick of time pureed into one but the whole psychiatrist working against the clock thing actually had me engaged at first but it at about the halfway mark of this movie that the bottom drops out and all that we re left with are lot of questions and very few plausible answers we get the overly smart kid who manages to pull one over on the bad guys we get weak woman with her leg in cast beating the crap out of tough bad guy we get douglas character new york uppedity psychiatrist suddenly turning into an action hero with moves and attitude to boot and what about the film main plot point why would the bad guys still give crap about this thing after 10 years and even more so why would they only give the shrink until the day end to do his part you waited 10 years what another few days or why not set up another heist instead ll tell you why it because we wouldn have bad movie otherwise that why and many many more ugh whatever the case it was just about the time that douglas character suddenly removed murphy character from the mental home and how come she went with him so nicely thought she didn trust him that turned to my buddy and asked when the movie had turned into joke and few bogus chase and action sequences later we were left with long winded ending that did little to answer any other questions might ve still had and actually brought up even more contradictions badly put together this movie features some decent acting some nice cinematography and an initially interesting premise but loses it all in haze of plot miscues which ultimately leave you with little care for anyone in fact if it wasn for brittany murphy excellent portrayal of traumatized teen jennifer esposito embarrassing performance as police woman yeah right watching her delivering lines was the funniest part of this flick but it wasn supposed to be and michael douglas cool regular guy part there would be little reason to remain seated until the end of this picture incidentally can anyone please give me one good reason why esposito character was in this movie in the first place she was completely superfluous and on top of all that by the end of this flick the director seems to have realized how dumb the audience must be to have bought most of the garbage that he been shoveling out for the hour and half prior and decides to add insult to injury by flashing back to an earlier character death when one of the bad guys dies just so we know as an audience that the two are interrelated somehow ooooh thanks mr fleder appreciate the spoon feeding dude yum yum but how about explaining every other plot point in your film that made no sense whatever either way don give rat ass because this movie is dog and that unfortunate because it actually did have some good points going for it see it if you like dumb thrillers incidentally if you appreciated along came spider you will likely enjoy this film as well they both start off with interesting premises only to toss all logic and sense out the window about halfway through where joblo coming from along came spider 10 girl interrupted 10 kiss the girls 10 primal fear 10 seven 10 10
beware of movies with the director name in the title take john carpenter ghosts of mars please if the carpenter brand name wasn superglued to the title this embarrassment would surely have bypassed theaters entirely and gone straight to its proper home on the usa network and would have been spared headache the latest from the director of starman halloween and escape from new york is lousy western all gussied up to look like futuristic horror flick the production is set on mars in 2176 where humanity looks for relief from the overpopulation strangling their home world six hundred and forty thousand people in matriarchal society live and work at outposts all over the kirmizi planet terra forming to make it more hospitable for future generations matriarchal society terra forming sounds pretty intriguing eh well don get your hopes up
there is rule when it comes to movies sequel is never as good as the original there are very few exceptions to this rule and texas chainsaw massacre the next generation is not one of them now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was really bad movie and that this isn even the first sequel to it you have recipe for very painful viewing experience don be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey time to kill and renee zellweger jerry maguire they made this movie before they were stars judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons it wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger apparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day and don blame them they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them unfortunately for them it is horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character while mcconaughey plays guy who wears mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with television remote control hey don say didn warn you to make matters worse leatherface the chainsaw wielding maniac who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers at the best of times has now become full blown cross dresser and spends the entire movie in drag there is plot to this movie but it isn worth mentioning let just suffice to say that group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left to the mercy of remote control man mcconaughey and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving half witted sidekick man can get over just how bad this movie is this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities even the obligatory topless babe shot wasn enough to hold my interest for more than seconds the writing is bad the direction is even worse but both of those things look good in comparison to the acting this is the sort of movie that they should make people in prison watch guarantee you if criminals thought that they would be subjected to this film they would never break the law again
movies based on video games such as street fighter or mario bros have never generated much interest at the box office but when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 it did surprisingly well with simple story pulsating soundtrack and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy it got my vote for the movie where expected the least and got the most and if you haven had the opportunity would definitely recommend that you see it on video in the world of mortal kombat based on the popular arcade game dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity the mortal kombat refers to competition fought by human mortals against outworld minions which if won will guarantee earth safety for another generation mk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition despite their victory however gateway has somehow opened and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth outworld warriors include an impressive collection of fighters including shao kahn mintoro centaur sheeva four armed ogre and sindel earth mortal warriors under the leadership of the benevolent god lord rayden includes liu kang princess kitana sonya blade and jax who must fight against outworld forces it an easy enough premise but unfortunately very unfortunately the writers try to do too much with the movie it is only video game after all but the on screen version tries to go beyond it comic book boundaries by adding depth conceptualization of self worth and worst of all love story this becomes very awkward because all of the players are fighters and nothing more they are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act this becomes embarrassingly apparent for example as the movie tries to develop romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana the original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best they spoke little but fought lot thus the movie was easy to digest however mk2 tries to give these players certain amount of depth an element that was lacking in the first movie but the attempt here fails miserably this uneasy feeling is readily apparent for example whenever you hear lord rayden speak not only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic useless advice but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom try reading this half as fast and you ll hear what mean but the movie is not complete fatality fight scenes are well choreographed highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility and players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game although their screen time amounts to nothing more than cameo even if you re not familiar with the video game each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves but it just too little of what movie goers and especially fans of the game will expect oddly the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence and the poor acting results in muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom rent the first one but the sequel is for kombat fans only
what is this homicide or bad movie that is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie let me clear things up for you cupcake this isn bad movie it really bad movie so bad it almost good almost but not quite the movie starts off in the 1950 with space aliens sending botched experiment down to earth it is bunch of slug like creatures that kill people and take over their bodies the slugs first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody that is until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986 he and the slugs inside him promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more co eds into slug zombies slightly crazed cop tom atkins and the requisite girl with the face of an angel jill whitlow join these two geeky university students jason lively and steve marshall to do battle with the slugs it more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs the acting is bad with capital the story is worse and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in home movie the only saving grace was the requisite tit shot courtesy of jill whitlow it had absolutely nothing to do with the story but liked it actually it was the high point of the movie for me of course that isn really saying much the story moves around in hap hazard fashion which gives it leg up on some other horror films unlike most movies of this genre there actually is story not great one but it is there this is one in long line of movies from the 1980 that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the 13th halloween and nightmare on elm street movies you could randomly select movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better but night of the creeps might make nice addition to movie horror marathon just don be too upset if you can find it you really won be missing that much

synopsis the president of company wants to test his self appointed successor who psychotic and thinks it great idea to spend week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after heavy snowfall comments tracks of killer had couple of strikes against it before even began watching it strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotape sticker in siyah marker not typically good sign when you rent film strike two came while the previews played did you ever get sinking premonition about movie quality or lack thereof while watching the trailers that come before it well the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows and they all looked bad definately not good sign tracks of killer itself completed the strikeout about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery to be fair the first half hour or so promises at least watchable thriller wolf larson who bears more than passing resemblance to hugh grant adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the film title james brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten brolin character for some inexplicable reason thinks its great idea to spend some time in cabin practically isolated with lebrock and larson whom he decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company by the time the characters arrive at the cabin this film begins to become tedious apparently brolin successor test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing which don seem like attributes necessary to run business in the city but then again what do know about business do think though that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin its beds and closets have habit of just breaking at the slightest touch larson character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill this leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters which really isn enough to sustain it the film writer must have taken cue from stephen king as scenes from tracks of killer seem lifted out of misery and gerald game larson and lebrock fight and torture each other the tables get turned couple of times while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help some old guy around too just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film the old guy however miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in scene so ludicrous it worthy of chuckle or two outside of that chuckle unfortunately tracks of killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors for some reason become increasing obnoxious if you re in video store and thinking about renting this turkey don make tracks to far superior suspense film like misery
adam sandler isn known for appearing in deep thought provoking films but he still really funny guy most of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them but because they let sandler do what he does best without stupid plot to drown him out big daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than sandler comic performance and it miserable failure sandler plays thirty something loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy played by cole and dylan sprouse as one might expect from the synopsis director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences including repulsive courtroom battle and lot of teary scenes in which characters say good bye to one another in addition there ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself there hilarious running joke featuring female doctor who previously worked at hooters and the film features passable performances from sandler joey lauren adams as the love interest and the two young boys but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny
it been hours since returned from the much anticipated sci fi opus `mission to mars and can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar why the movie is shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy stapled carelessly onto flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of space opera instead shooting for the angle of feel good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 space odyssey got the feeling that most of my fellow movie going patrons were expecting another `armageddon but no `mission to mars certainly isn one large action sequence about colossal disaster this is supposedly thoughtful family friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel you have been warned of course crafting tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible see `apollo 13 for an excellent example but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off when he gets his hands on an intelligent systematically practical script like `the untouchables or `mission impossible the director has the ability to create sound technical achievement although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally of course there also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name including `snake eyes and the notorious bomb `the bonfire of the vanities all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood that term may be too harsh but if were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient if were gary sinise wouldn touch de palma with 10 foot pole sinise is wonderful wonderful actor but after appearing in `snake eyes and this vomit inducing sham sure he wouldn want to risk the embarrassment of third collaboration the academy award winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell man who recently lost his wife kim delaney and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars oops forgot to mention the year 2020 after barbecue get together for the astronauts we cut to luc goddard don cheadle and his team who are already taking measurements and calculations on the kirmizi planet suddenly towering formation of rocks and soil probably best dubbed `sand tornado appears and creates whirlwind of suction for some reason the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this as if it were lovely piece of art the team is killed within seconds expect for luc who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive immediately second mission consisting of astronauts mcconnell husband and wife woody and terri blake tim robbins and connie nielsen and phil ohlmyer jerry connell are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars let put the `secret on hold for now and discuss the trip there it is explained whether scientifically accurate or not probably not that trip to mars takes roughly six months not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind `m2m didn capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia instead we join the team during their final days aboard the ship what happened during the five months prior to this did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes still there are few nicely tense moments maybe the only in the movie during the time frame involving fuel leak depalma direction is quite good in these scenes although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent organ music in space mon there few good imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud it colossal bummer that `mission to mars is poorly assembled and laughably written with dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists as mentioned before anyone looking for some disaster movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed maybe even cheated after the unbelievably hokey final shot with the words the end somehow adding insult to injury few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen others muttered obscenities shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling `jeez that sucked okay it did suck but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy after all they do pretty well sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as loving nasa couple and funnyman connell well he has couple lines are actually amusing and intentionally so the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive so by golly where did this `mission go wrong looking back on the appalling experience would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have while watching `mission to mars my suggestion would be to immediately abort or better yet don even strap yourself in for lift off
the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john maybury love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon as always jacobi acting is impeccable but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque the movie convincingly argues that francis played by jacobi was completely despicable and vain individual but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude when interviewed by fawning talk show host francis calls his style chance brushstrokes starting with burglary of francis flat the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from cheap horror movie the camera shots are heavy on the avant garde angles lots of wide angle close ups and distorted shots filmed through colored glass reflections the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being sterile examination of lonely and vain man daniel craig in lifeless performance plays the burglar and boxer george dyer when francis lays eyes on him after the break in francis promises not to call the police if he ll stay for sex he stays for the entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares bed he thinks that francis paintings have no bloody use and the movie presents no counterargument writer maybury barely outlines francis character and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain complete enigma we learn little of george other than francis reason for liking him george amorality and innocence francis love of sadomasochism is shown early and often boxing is such marvelous aperitif for sex he reflects to george on the way to watch boxing match as the fighter head is sliced open with heavy blow the camera cuts to gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood francis appears to be in complete ecstasy another of francis favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities as the carnage mounts we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience in film that tries obsessively to shock one dream sequence portrays family in car accident francis mind slowly examines every bloody limb of the mother the father and the boy sometimes the script throws us tidbits of francis wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful optimistic by nature optimistic about nothing loneliness is my only true companion we learn more details about francis makeup techniques than about the man himself he prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning powder for his teeth full of metaphorical interpretations the film best scene occurs late one night when george has to get up to go to the bathroom mistaking francis picture of toilet for the genuine article he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly like parody of bad art house movie love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly by director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling by the end the audience hasn learned any more than it could have in three minute sketch love is the devil runs 30 the film is not rated but should be considered nc 17 for violence profanity graphic sex nudity and sadomasochism and is unacceptable for most teenagers
the above is dialogue from this film taken almost completely in context and not jazzed up bit to make it more inept than it is it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film and basically serves as perfect example of what this film is about especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously mr gregg having mid life crisis araki the writer and director of this film wants to show how important teenagers are and wants to show how they feel in such horrible horrible world and how does he show it by really cheap surrealism and moronic exchanges like this oh and it gets better similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of oh dunno the fiftieth sex scene in this film not counting the several masturbation scenes in it one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another and he says to her something along the lines of do you ever wonder what life is all about sorry man foreplay takes place before the act of coitus of course what do you expect the film was written and directed by guy who can even spell his first name right yes know it cheap joke but it had to be done the doom generation is advertised as road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them and also as another teen angst film one of the slogans is teen is four letter word hardy har har it film about two angsty teens amy mavi rose macgowan who would later play the buxom tatum in scream and jordon beyaz james duval who would go on to play randy quaid son in independence day who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac xavier kirmizi jonathan schaech who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in that thing you do and by the way do you get the symbolism red beyaz and mavi huh huh and go on road trip where three things happen in no order they have sex they run into weird people they kill them the film is basically remix of bunch of other far superior films gregg araki obviously has seen such films as easy rider natural born killers and kalifornia and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like pop culture reference guide but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper the doom generation doesn want to do this it just wants to show everything in surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level he wants to show everything in weird manner and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about here one scene an earlier scene in the film amy and jordan go into quick mart type place to get food and other stuff amy is smoking and the clerk an asian man mind you love how racist this film is really do tells her to put it out she tells him to fuck off or something to that note he points shotgun at her and she puts it out reluctantly jordan makes two hot dogs and takes them to the counter the cash register rings up 66 oh and this symbolism doesn stop here jordan checks for his wallet but it really in the car he asks amy for it but she left her wallet in the car as well the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money they say they don have it he gets ready to kill them but then xavier who they ditched in the middle of nowhere scene before pops out of nowhere fights with the clerk and ends with him blowing the clerk head clean off clean wound mind you the head is shown flying through the air and lands in fryer where it begins to scream don really object to this kind of sick violence but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only to gross you out araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme he ll make some kind of art wrong it takes kind of resistance to make gore art when george romero made dawn of the dead very gory flick even for today he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick same goes for peter jackson disgustingly gory dead alive which features 30 minute long fest of blood guts dismemberments flesh chewing and other assorted stuff all ending with guy with lawn mower strapped to his body taking out all sorts of zombies it was sick but it was also satirical and controled scene like this has no purpose in the film and it sticks out from everything else that happens here couple other scenes jordan and amy have sex in bath tub and xavier watches masturbates and then licks the semen from his hand xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window masturbates and falls backwards man attacks the trio and is stabbed in the crotch by giant sword put there just so this could happen fast food employee stalks the trio and his arm is shot off by xavier and various other annoyances also look for about million camoes from wide assortment of people who probably didn really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it just like peter toole helen mirren malcolm macdowell and john gielgud probably didn when they signed to be in caligula people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel hollywood madam heidi fleiss christopher peter brady mcknight amanda bearse and margaret cho all grace the screen for matter of seconds then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line why are they here so that we can all point to them and say hey look it fill in the blank wow gimme break the film meaning is pretty easy to detect that you know teens are so precious and the world is such horrible place that when the two entities collide there giant explosion of horrific violence otherwise defined as teen angst or the belief that being teenager is horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you look 19 years old went through very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did ve since moved on to don really know what to do with my life phase but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they re dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse part of being teen is experimenting and testing the waters it not whining about how awful parents are and purposely feeling dispondent this is what the characters in this film do and the film wants to show how they re these great people who are being punished by the world because they re teenagers and how they try to defend themselves but can totally overcome them it not their fault they kill people it the world what they really need is reality check the world is bad place and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting but part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed and there nothing they can do about it hence the title not only does it have bad fallacy but it can even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner everything overly surreal and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst how does talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction he show them for what they really are and if he didn want the satirical approach he show the real problems with the world and if you still don think that the doom generation is incompetent on every single possible level it could be take the acting rose macgowan is horrible yes she proved herself talented in scream but she so bad in the doom generation that if had not seen her in scream would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today her entire performance is one note bitchy and the one scene where she cries over dead animal is so forced that it laughable equally bad is jonathan schaech who wants to be the slacker serial killer someone who doesn have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain his performance is annoying as hell and granted he was better in that thing you do and then there james duval let just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando he has the same kind of slacker stuttering only much much much worse and every line he says is so bad that have now deemed him least talented actor in the world have seen lots of bad actors but james duval has got to be the worst or at least somewhere up there here another example of bad scene if you re still not convinced the film opens up in club where they re playing nine inch nail most banal song heresy example of the lines god is dead and no one cares if there is hell ll see you there and as the song plays and kirmizi strobe lights show the patrons dancing the film pans over to amy just standing there looking dispondent the film closes in on her she looks right at the camera and says fuck no explanation of this should be necessary and finally note to gregg grow up really move out of your parent basement read something other than

when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain you know that you can expect nothing more than grade action movie however since this film also featured michael madsen more than capable character actor this time in the role of protagonist the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt however the very first scenes show clear grade action credentials madsen plays richard montana tough policeman who raids drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio played by lynch however the raid was only partially successful and montana is getting the rap so he begins his own private war against gio trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt in the process he meets gio mistress gina zamora played by rosie vela and starts relationship with her too although it doesn stink like many of the similar films can inside edge is mostly forgettable grade action routine nobody in this film actually puts much effort including madsen or lynch and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke the only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela who apart from showing her more than impressive looks shows some of the singing talent too however this isn reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching film that they would in most likelihood forget the next day
saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night and have to say wasn too impressed this film is about an expert marine sniper played by tom berenger who is teamed with hot shot young no experience never killed man new partner to take out some drug kingpins and military strong men in panama sound cliche that only the beginning billy zane memphis belle played the rookie and never seemed to get handle on his character he was so contrary and pig headed in the beginning you just wanted to smack him then he goes crazy from the pressure but seems to immediately snap out of it not sure if the blame should lie with the directing editing scriptwriting or acting but it didn all come together think berenger is pretty good actor and he looked great in the part covered in camo face painted stalking through the jungle with his high power rifle but once again his character was given some pretty bad dialogue and didn react too logically to many of the situations there was very little logical development in these characters my biggest problem with this film was it tendency to put these two snipers in as many inches from death situations as possible they began to resemble joes the greatest american hero and of course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls now lot of movies are stamped out of this mold in fact that what made die hard so much fun the super hero avenger type so some will enjoy the action hero heroics but didn think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes and the real life feel of covert operations in panama word must be said on the camera work much of it was very nice the jungles of panama or their stand ins in this case formed very picturesque background and the drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography many have seen the slowed down bullet cam following the projectile to its target this was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill it was dramatic when used in flashback but it seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots pardon the pun into the real time action then it just seemed silly all in all not real dog there is some nice action good atmosphere and pretty photography but the plot is pretty lame the acting didn form cohesive whole and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics
synopsis lifelong friends rafe affleck and danny hartnett join the us air force and are stationed at pearl harbor hawaii rafe goes to england to fight alongside british pilots and is seemingly killed in action danny falls in love with rafe girlfriend evelyn beckinsale but rafe survives and returns to confront his former friend meanwhile the japanese sneak attack is imminent review pearl harbor is perfect example of movies as product rather than as art it is little more than crassly calculated attempt to woo the masses enticing them with big stars big effects and big setting but no heart it is difficult to criticise the actors because they do everything the movie demands of them sadly this amounts to barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to see the script randall wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he was writing pearl harbor with his left the plot here is pure cliche and the wartime setting simply convenient backdrop there is no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to the united states and no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join world war ii instead there is just an assembly line love triangle some empty patriotic rhetoric and laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders when one intones fear all we have done is to awaken sleeping giant nearly fell out of my seat to the movie credit it does include fantastic portrayal of the attack itself an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges viewers into the war if only the remaining two hours had been crafted with such skill perhaps this memorial day non event would have been worth watching
take two old and dying men lifetime of regrets house full of sins thoroughly despicable man enough lies insecurities and other character defects to keep team of psychiatrists gainfully employed then add inexplicable meteorological and amphibian based phenomenon and you will have summed up magnolia the newest film from paul thomas anderson boogie nights the movie tells multiple stories weaving them together or overlapping them during the course of its three hour running time would that the stories were worth the telling earl partridge jason robards thousand acres is dying of cancer bedridden in much pain it is obvious that his time is growing short his much younger wife played by julianne moore an ideal husband is surprised to find herself struggling with his impending death having married for money she discovers that she has actually fallen in love with the old guy and regrets having cheated and lied earl regrets having cheated on his first wife and estranging himself from his only son tom cruise eyes wide shut now misogynist self help guru who teaches men how to seduce and destroy his sexual and vulgar perspective on male female relationships is so over the top as to be utterly unbelievable meanwhile jimmy gator philip baker hall the insider is also dying of cancer not as physically incapacitated as earl jimmy is still able to perform his duties as the lovable host of long running quiz show which pits adults against children the current whiz quiz kid is stanley spector jeremy blackman in his film debut who is tired of the pressure of performing and is willing to call it quits on the other hand quiz kid donnie smith william macy mystery men would like nothing more than to return to the spotlight when he was somebody his pathetic life is souring as he can no longer capitalize on his brief 15 minutes of fame which stanley is all too eager to relinquish jimmy has his own family crisis as his drug addict daughter melora walters boogie nights refuses to have anything to do with him for reasons which are not disclosed to us until the end of the film grabbing at one last attempt at happiness she reaches out to softhearted cop john reilly never been kissed even as she tries to push herself away from him because she deems herself not worthy of his affection this dysfunctional group carries on for what seems to be an interminable two thirds of the movie and then it gets worse literally raining frogs yes frogs assuming it to be an intended deus ex machina device it is an ineffective one because it doesn seem to faze the characters much oh they may step gingerly around the splattered frog corpses littering the streets but otherwise the frog shower didn seem to change their behavior or pattern of living or dying there is simply too much going on in this movie and most of it is distasteful to watch mr anderson further obscures the film by incorporating loud and intrusive sound track that often drowned out the dialogue character who apparently rapped significant clue to plot development which was completely unintelligble and heavy handed segment of historical occurances containing ironic twists which set up absolutely nothing one of the recurring themes is found in line donnie quotes we may be done with the past but the past is not done with us this is an absolute lie god is in the forgiveness business in fact as we humbly ask for forgiveness and repent or change our offending mindset god word says that he not only forgives he also forgets even am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake and will not remember thy sins isaiah 43 25 [kjv] the spiritual one who keeps bringing up our unrighteous past is the same one who wants to keep us in state of condemnation don let him next time your spiritual adversary reminds you of your past take great pleasure in reminding him of his future he hates that

once upon time jean claude van damme was decent action hero the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films boasting his spectacular martial arts ability some of these excursions were fun but now it seems like watching van damme movie has become painful chore with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mind numbing action and when the action goes sour what is there left to enjoy ll explain knock off is about pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong marcus ray van damme babe magnet and stylish dresser heads up the company with an annoying weasel of partner rob schneider they become part of plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans seemingly by mole in the business going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph so if you want review devoid of spoilers skip onto the next one not quite sure who gives crap but ll issue warning anyhow tommy is really working with the cia his boss very hammy and flat paul sorvino is the mole and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons he even stoops so low to put them into children toys if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing then you probably will enjoy knock off if you think that this ridiculous set up couldn even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing this might not be your cup of tea knock off sucks it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something simply because van damme is the star the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind the performances are so wooden you could use them to row canoe and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe director tsui hark who teamed with van damme in the superior but still lame brained double team is at the helm and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot suppose enjoyed some of the camera work but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence speeds are altered consistently and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired it all sounds very cool trust me it isn as much as it scars me to say this har har van damme is terrible sure he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease he looks like he doing bad impersonation of jackie chan and his performance is stiff and tired hate to say it but perhaps it time for mr van damme to give up his day job it really test of endurance watching knock off suppose there some enjoyment derived from schneider character who is extremely annoying but provides the film better moments and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter knock off doesn even stand strong as mindless but entertaining action film like handful of van damme others no this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department that is certainly not saying much note to self avoid universal soldier the return upon release in august 99
this is the worst movie ve seen since the so bad walked out on it jingle all the way it is crap on toast made of crap baked in an oven fueled by crap it is crap through and through nothing works in this film as to be expected from joel schumacher who has made only one watchable film in his entire career that being cousins here man who admits he medicore director rather charmingly self effacing statement but truth be told he is much worse than mediocre not all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again there is no plot anywhere and the dialogue is unrelentingly shallow preposterous and boring they set up mr freeze as tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one liners it turns him into stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death but that par for course nothing in this film makes any sense including half of arnold schwarzenegger lines as mr freeze arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once this is the same problem he had in jingle all the way and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass personally think that he has more pull with the directors and doesn retake scenes to make him understandable compare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in batman robin apparently james cameron knows how to get competent performance out of arnold uma thurman is not as bad but nothing resembling good either her poison ivy vamps around terribly chewing up scenery left and right and her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub snl standard acting as if she reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment given the script it wonder it didn happen more frequently there is no redeeming feature in this film not george clooney as batman chris donnell as robin nor alicia silverstone as batgirl michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance in fact there was something unsettling about his appearance which seems to have been accomplished without any make up tricks looking as if it were scenes from documentary about dying man unfortunately every scene about alfred sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance they just go through the motions losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart the movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of big battle you know there bunch of people but instead of melee schumacher decided to focus on foot or fist there never moment of awe wonder or mayhem the only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects which are impressive and probably expensive even then the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable the hockey team from hell not even the tv series got that stupid at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that batman robin showcases frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do blink and you ll miss elle macpherson as julie madison vivica fox as why is she even in the film vamp in freeze lair with all of two lines and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had and in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs fries she isn even filmed well enough to look good trust me she quite attractive outside of this dreck and as if the film weren bad enough to limp along with bad direction bad dialogue bad performances and bad fight scenes there are inconsistencies and illogic galore know it nit picky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs why the character arms aren ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish one armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet while holding on to another person no less or where the moisture comes from when freeze weapon creates tons if ice that all traditional comic book stuff but why does batman spring trap for freeze at public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of by standers why is there big switch clearly marked heat in mr freeze lair why do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr freeze hand to hand why does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have suit made for her why do batman robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency and since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones why don they wear masks to filter it out could go on and on batman robin is braindead pointless garish loud film that should still reign as the worst film of the year by the time 1998 rolls along note to warner bros if you re going to make another batman film please replace schumacher with nearly anyone because it could actually get worse than this what schumacher does not understand is that comic book doesn automatically equal unbearable idiocy the true equation seems to be schumacher batman unbearable idiocy
have never seen man so in love with himself than george lucas with the overt success of the three original star wars films lucas has become not necessarily filmmaker but the head cheeze at huge toy company with the phantom menace the new product on the shelve only this toy was made for $115 million but every kid wants it and like all other expensive toys falls apart within an hour after playing with it the product in question star wars episode the phantom menace jeez is pure and simple its about the money baby no one in their right mind would create such fiasco if they knew it wouldn make ton of money before its fourth week of release come to the sw franchise as stranger since have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular find them rather boring and full of nothing but eye candy phantom menace is like the first sw minus 10 nothing in the whole concept is remotely enjoyable even the special effects seem rather bland the story in this new one is mindless mess the acting wooden and the action sequences like something out of video game sw phantom menace is one of the worst films of the year so far with title like sw e1 tpm lucas has one big head on those shoulders thought chris carter did for releasing an files movie although that movie adaptation was an excellent way to spend two hours pm is one long headache
an affluent horse breeder past comes up to haunt him an ages old cover up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices that pretty much the essence of the movie and have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source the acting in particular found very good the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie few things about the story didn sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone yet in the end her character played relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better on the flip side the character played by catherine keener found to be very interesting and thought that it was developed very well and helped the story lot the character aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener all these people acted their parts admirably as for the part that sharon stone played she played it well but the part was not utilized enough the directing for this movie is something that have to comment on because for once in long while you see director actually add very distinctive flavor to movie this is one of those occasions matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and think he tackled touch subject myself wouldn be able to look at horseracing and make movie out of it there is certain flavor about this movie and think that the direction of the movie is the reason for this the one flaw that do have to comment on is the pacing the subject matter in my opinion wasn interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if myself don like it all in all found this movie boring and very slow the acting was good but the story just didn evolve enough and wasn captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch although there is much going for the movie didn find it good even though see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them wouldn recommend this movie to anyone but if you are horse fanatic or racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie
by the time dennis quaid the ostensible star of switchback makes his first appearance at about the 22 minute mark you may find yourself wondering why he bothered after all writer director jeb stuart has already set up fairly promising pair of parallel story lines the first finds amarillo texas sheriff buck olmstead lee ermey facing hotly contested election battle just as brutal double homicide is discovered at motel in his jurisdiction as olmstead begins his investigation we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects lane dixon jared leto is an enigmatic young hitchhiker bob goodall danny glover is the jovial motorist who offers lane ride from texas to his utah destination all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other protagonist but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years he not supposed to be tracking him any more according to the bureau they ve got their man but lacrosse has very important reason for believing otherwise two months earlier lacrosse own son was kidnapped by the killer and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere lacrosse knows his killer work and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game it wouldn be fair to reduce everything that wrong with switchback to quaid presence but it pretty good place to start there reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center as dramatic actor dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is perpetual tight jawed sourpuss pucker we can tell he grim because every word comes out in an eastwood esque rasp more flexible performer might have given weight to the character pulling the audience into his haunted intensity making switchback _his_ film quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated it tough to become emotionally invested in character turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is big bowl of bran flakes even without quaid it doesn appear that switchback would have stayed on course the early scenes between leto and glover have lively energy building our curiosity over which man the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor is the real threat unfortunately stuart tips his hand far too early in the game both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal once the mystery of the killer identity is dispatched the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable in fact stale and predictable describes the direction that switchback takes in general falling back on far too common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere climactic fistfight on board freight train and edgy law enforcement agents it too bad stuart wasn willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film played with atypical restraint by lee ermey he wonderful unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled film maker willing to take few risks with his casting and story telling instead stuart places his trust in name star who can carry the material maybe next time he ll throw away that one crucial page in the script the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up perfectly good story
when you ve run out of old tv shows to turn into movies guess you try video games why did go to see mortal kombat annihilation the quest to seek an answer to this query may prove better movie that the one just saw this film was bunch of fighting yelling special effects and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack the plot is fairly simple portal has opened between our world and the outworld allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn brian thompson to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity the good guys led by sorcerer rayden james remar and human mortal liu kang robin shou must take the fight to outworld where the fate of both worlds will be determined here the catch they must reunite princess katana talia soto who on the good side with her resurrected mother queen sindel musetta vander who on the bad side for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanity safety for another generation how this is supposed to work still have no idea but liked katana line knew love would keep us together since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and got good laugh there are some seriously stupid things in this movie take for example transportation system which utilizes the inner winds generated by earth magma flows you get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast how fast as katana says you will be moving so fast it will be as if you are not moving at all what later sonya blade sandra hess goes to find jax lynn kirmizi williams otherwise known as saber on tv american gladiators at medical research facility on the island of oahu how do we know this is where she went there sign on the facility perimeter fence that reads medical research facility oahu hawaii remember this is not caption but an actual sign guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are there lot of major flipping action too the first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another do they land and immediately get into the fighting does one of them land first and catch the other off guard do they collide in mid air no apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away why did they need those metal balls to travel everyone could have just flipped from point to point have to admit the fight scenes are pretty good although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics the movie thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly ouch was the most common expletive heard when screened this one you could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights not plot would be the main draw since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next it seems that all there is in this movie maybe it is as had mentioned the acting is bad there not one solid performance in the film although williams as jax was pretty funny after fight between sonya and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling jax says you look good in mud no really you do remar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang brian thompson who has played good guys bad guys and even an alien on tv the files but always some muscle bound behemoth is your average evil demi god but it more the script fault than his own that he doesn have anything original to say the one really impressive thing about this movie is that there is not one swear word in the whole hour and half another thing which should be noted is that for all its punching and kicking blood only appears in one scene all in all mortal kombat annihilation is loud violent shallow and marketed toward kids hey just like the video game
with all that education you should know what happiness is starring sylvia chang teresa hu hsu ming li lieh mao hsueh wei directed by edward yang written by yang and wu nien chen cinematography by christopher doyle and chang hui kung every country has eventually its new wave france had its nouvelle vague brazil its cinema novo china its fifth generation and on and on some waves just take longer than others before they wash over us cleansing us with the balm of discovery taiwan new wave came in the 1980s in the work of directors like hou hsiao hsien wan jen and edward yang that day on the beach yang first feature is central it created new language for young taiwanese directors even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here giving taiwan distinctive international presence that day itself is long and frustrating the document of nation attempt to find voice it does not lack ambition it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan in the manner of antonioni elaborating the alienation that the westernized white collar middle class feel as their lives are shaped by old fashioned roles dedicated career men loyal housewives that they find unfulfilling jia li sylvia chang is the focus but the film brings others into its compass her husband her brother friends from her college days as it charts her discontents no one is happy jia li married her husband we lei at young age at the time her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage despite his affection for another woman and so jia li marriage seemed in comparison good one she chose we lei of her own free will they loved each other but it goes wrong that day dutifully presents all the clich we lei becomes absorbed in his career indulges in an affair with co worker jia li feels restless and trapped bound by choice she made while young but which no longer seems wise the film never redeems these clich by conveying the feel of authentic experience the intensity of lived pain and much of it seems trite and belaboured it unfolds awkwardly as series of flashbacks told during luncheon in vienna where jia li meets her brother old flame teresa hu now concert pianist whom she has not seen since college both women seem rather sad and resigned to their sadness their circumstances and those of jia li brother and college friend suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices married the wrong man chosen the wrong career path etc but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate it is not that jia li married the wrong man she didn the problem is that she needed to marry at all and that if she did not marry she would still be just as unhappy for woman in modern taiwan that day tells us the cards are stacked the dice are loaded she can play the game but the house always wins the film sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan seen now it does not seem provocative indeed it hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy it may be ambitious it may be innovative but it is also terribly terribly dull and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others and his use of those methods is fumbling uncertain undisciplined nor does he bring anything new other than the locale to the material there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for in young couple first kiss in the awkward meeting of woman and her husband mistress but they are brief too often yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes grocery shopping flower arranging in which nothing happens little is said no emotion imparted perhaps if the film were content to focus on such reflective inward moments leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings it might have been ambiguous suggestive insinuating but jia li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence they talk about their problems at length in detail redundantly and eliminate all subtleties at two hours and forty five minutes it all seems exorbitantly long indulgently long winded consider the defining moment for jia li the titular day on the beach the thrust of the whole film explains easily enough what we are to think of that moment what it means when she walks away from particular situation even so the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally in case we may have missed the point needless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed and that is the problem throughout the look of the film is as tedious as the drawn out narrative it was the first feature shot by christopher doyle at least it his name in the credits who is now rightly regarded as one of the world leading cinematographers in the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar wai he seems incapable of fashioning boring image you would never know it from watching that day which due either to doyle inexperience or yang humdrum direction is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible in scrutinizing the long decay of marriage that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience but none of the damage none of the heartbreak
the real blonde woman face an arm some pumped up pectorals blond hair man sad face slender legs random hand here and there as the opening credits of tom dicillo the real blonde unfold these scattered fractured glimpses eventually come together to form the image of bikini brief clad man on his knees clinging to nurturing woman his head concealing her unclothed breasts if only the rest of this formless aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently joe matthew modine is waiter struggling actor too proud to take gigs in commercials or soap operas he feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his live in love mary catherine keener who holds some subconscious hostility toward the male gender mary makeup artist regularly works on model sahara bridgette wilson who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disney the little mermaid the bottle blonde has turbulent on again off again relationship with bob maxwell caulfield soap actor who yearns for the taste of real blonde which he finds in co star kelly daryl hannah as the film unspools variety of other characters pass through fashion photographer blair marlo thomas mary shrink buck henry and self defense instructor denis leary joe casting agent kathleen turner and hardass boss christopher lloyd and mystery woman elizabeth berkley who keeps on crossing joe path where exactly does all this go that question best posed to writer director dicillo who doesn appear to have the slightest clue himself his meandering largely unfunny script and direction are like hopelessly lost drivers turning into dead end narrative streets only to reverse course and hit another creative cul de sac and another and another at one point bob frustrated with the soap scripts complains to the head writer jim fyfe that his and kelly characters keep on going in circles with no hint of development or growth that is most certainly the case here joe gets job and ultimately botches things he and mary bicker they make up only to have the pattern repeat itself unhappy with his bottle blonde bob gets his real blonde but is unsatisfied he returns to the faux and is still unsatisfied if there is point to all of this dicillo dances around it spending his time on apparent digressions that as it turns out aren digressions at all the real blonde is not without some amusements it does have the occasional funny line and situation leary henry lloyd steve buscemi and dave chappelle shine in their small roles keener is likable refreshingly earthy lead berkley appearance is mercifully brief she receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for ten minute role and there is the irony of having caulfield play wildly popular soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket last year the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after scant six months due to lack of viewer interest but on the whole the real blonde is frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its title it may be glossy on the surface but there nothing going on inside opens february 27
jack frost is one of those dumb corny concoctions that attempts to be heartwarming family film but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching this does not come as surprise since the studio that made it is warner brothers who is on current streak of one bad film after the other jack frost michael keaton is struggling middle aged rock musician who loves his wife gabby kelly preston and 11 year old son charlie joseph cross but doesn spend nearly enough time with them when he receives call from music label that wants to hear him play he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas halfway there jack has second thoughts but on his way back home is in car accident and dies switch forward year christmas is approaching once again and charlie and gabby are still having difficult time coming to terms with jack death when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died the snowman outside the house is taken over by jack spirit jack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise frosty the snowman is classic cartoon and the idea of snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated but as live action film it doesn work at all after somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established jack frost quickly goes downhill especially once the snowman comes into play since jack has been deceased for whole year you would think there would be many questions to ask him such as what happens after you die or how does it feel to be snowman but instead the film focuses on snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before even sat down to watch the movie the performances are respectable enough but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in silly film like this michael keaton at least got off easy since he disappears after the first twenty minutes but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here have always liked kelly preston she is clearly talented charismatic actress but has never been given good role in her life usually having to settle for one dimensional supporting character as in 1997 nothing to lose and addicted to love joseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast since he believably portrayed boy suffering the loss of parent in one of the only subplots that actually works due to its wittiness henry rollins is highly amusing as hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman this brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side however by the tried and true main plot at hand which is the sappy story of father and son since knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid cringe inducing lines of dialogue some of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father you da man says charlie no da snowman replies jack or how about this little zinger coming from school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out snowdad is better than no dad do people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this the snowman created by john henson creature shop is more believable than the snowman from last year unintentionally hilarious direct to video horror flick also called jack frost but it still was difficult to tell if it was person in suit or computer effects either way it was an awful lot of work to go through just to come up with final product as featherbrained as this project as seasonal holiday picture jack frost is pretty much clunker better christmas film from this year is ll be home for christmas better yet my suggestion would be to stay home and watch quality film such as it wonderful life christmas story or prancer jack frost is an earnest but severely misguided film and children as well as adults deserve better doubt they would want to see movie about the death of parent anyway
some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone in the movie has turned off their brains the real mccoy is both it charmless molasses slow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta where the real mccoy is set might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy kim basinger being arrested in the middle of job six years later karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight she soon bumps into barker val kilmer hapless would be thief who idolizes karen also has ties to jack schmidt terence stamp the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him schmidt who is in cahoots with karen sleazy parole officer gailard sartain again wants karen to help him stage robbery this time he has some leverage karen kidnapped son just when she thought she was out they keep pulling her back in contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them leading the list is the jack schmidt character who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime let alone why he would actually participate in the break in karen initial encounter with during botched convenience store hold up also strains the limits of credibility it would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point but instead they run into each other the next day because they re leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment small world eh then there the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape and pet tigers which through the power of the laws of bad cinema must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage however the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police who come off like the keystone kops on bad day but the fun doesn end there in the shambles of script by william davies and william osborne there is also the absence of single solitary interesting character karen is earnest and single minded in her motherly devotion but lacking any kind of edge which would make her convincing criminal and basinger is not thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material schmidt is flaccid villain the parole officer is complete blank and karen son and ex husband might as well be furniture only kilmer is remotely appealing but his one potentially intriguing quality his ineptitude is never developed in fact kilmer disappears during the middle of the film just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting sub plot might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to caper comedy but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast various scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever and some end with no reason evident why they didn end up on the cutting room floor even the reasonably clever climactic break in falls victim to this syndrome including scene of one of the thieves drilling open vault which lasts kid you not four minutes there is no tension in the scene just tedium russell mulcahy highlander is director with some style and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good but he completely stumbles in the editing room there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that tempted to overlook the little ones like karen disarming one of schmidt henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of park where her son is playing like fountain crushed when van runs into it reappearing in one piece few moments later tempted but pretty good at resisting temptation
synopsis wealthy cuban landowner luis banderas gets more than he bargained for when he sends away for an american bride not only does his new wife turn out to be the beautiful julia jolie she also harbours secret past of dubious merit soon julia has absconded with both luis fortune and his heart and as he pursues his wife through the cuban underworld luis begins to realise that for him there is no turning back review given the absurdism of its would be plot it unlikely that original sin could have been turned into reputable piece of filmmaking regardless of writer director or stars this is at its heart movie junk lurid melodrama which appeals to neither the brain nor the heart but to the nether regions that said original sin could at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness and indulged in it instead cristofer seems to have mistaken this for serious production and directs it as such the result is vapid uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses as likely to incite yawn as thrill consider the initial sex scene between banderas and jolie brightly lit and mostly filmed from above it looks like an excerpt from an amateur soft porn show cristofer doesn even manage to capture the allure of cuba instead of portraying his setting as steamy sensuous island paradise it appears bland and lifeless at least banderas and jolie manage to inspire some interest there are hints at times that they want to have more fun with the script but aren being given the chance the same cannot be said of jane whose billy is nebbish and transparent also unwise is the jolie framing sequence which practically gives away the film denouement
david schwimmer from the television series friends stars as sensitive and slightly neurotic single guy who gets more than he expected from the grieving mother barbara hershey of classmate he can remember hello mrs robinson though quite cute as romantic comedy the pallbearer is paced like funeral march the characters act react and interact at half speed making for one excruciatingly long sit and what with the dreary lighting co writer director matt reeves brings some snap to the story midsection the film briefly comes to life when our hero attempts to resolve his feelings for another classmate very appealing gwyneth paltrow by this time though most viewers will have either fled or fallen asleep those tough souls who stay with it can marvel at the sleepy eyed schwimmer hound dog with head cold who can go for over an hour without ever changing his expression
seen at amc old pasadena pasadena ca in sdds paul verhoeven last movie showgirls had bad script bad acting and plot use the word in its loosest possible sense that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity it stank starship troopers has bad script bad acting and plot that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore it stinks nobody will watch this movie for the plot but here brief synopsis anyway some friends straight out of high school sign up for the federal reserve armed forces at time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the other side of the galaxy after one slips through the defences and destroys buenos aires the home city of the main characters war is declared this involves sending the grunts who include johnny rico van dien and dizzy meyer down to the surface of the bugs planet much carnage ensues the troops are withdrawn and sent to another planet to answer distress call more carnage ensues after being rescued their plans are changed to capture brain bug which is believed to be controlling the aliens battle plans look didn write this ok yet more carnage ensues get the picture interspersed throughout all this are brief ads from the federal network which present the picture of neo fascist state much like in verhoeven robocop there are many problems with starship troopers the plot where one exists to drive the movie onwards is silly harris star of tv doogie howser md is presented with psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in the movie apparently so we will accept his ability to mind meld with brain bug later on in addition the first thirty minutes of the movie until the characters sign up for service drag on like bad episode of beverly hills 90210 the characters are one dimensional so much so that when dizzy is killed she says it ok because she got to sleep with rico had hoped that verhoeven use of no name cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience but such an idea appears to have escaped him the dialogue is embarassing and isn helped by the frequently terrible delivery almost burst out laughing when harris delivered his speech about the need to sacrifice few hundred people for the good of the species finally the fake ads become nuisance although they evoke the propaganda of the wwii era movietone reels as presumably they are meant to their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect some people will say all of that irrelevant the movie hinges on the battle scenes so what about those battle scenes well admit the effects are good the bugs move about quite convincingly especially when they have been deprived of few of their limbs and people have their brains blown out their limbs cut off and their bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways but this is my problem the entertainment value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore and its continous attempt to gross us out starting early on when richards character vomits on screen verhoeven appears to be trying to make movie employing the elements that made robocop success but fails spectacularly while robocop had message about the importance of being human and gave the bad guys some motivation starship troopers lacks even these simple features when the brain bug sucks out character brain near the end of the film it merely an analogy for what the film has done to us this film is full of graphic violence and is not suitable for children under 16
the most absurd remake of 1998 it toss up between gus van sant psycho and mighty joe young the new disney picture based on the old rko picture knew was in trouble when polished computer generated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits there is no great demand for another giant ape movie make that ape movie period witness the quick deaths of buddy born to be wild and congo and while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable it also an assembly line product through and through lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it theron is jill young as young girl in the wilds of africa she befriended baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers that baby gorilla nicknamed joe grows to immense proportions and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers enter conservationist greg paxton who convinces jill to move with joe to california where they can protect him better in controlled environment joe is restless at first no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in plotting joe demise suffice it to say the movie could have been called joe ape in the city theron so good in devil advocate and paxton so good in the recent simple plan are fine actors but not fine enough to transcend the material paint by numbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising the plot arguably borrows more from steven spielberg the lost world than the 1949 original with the computer generated rex mean joe wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third with jill shouting look joe headed for the movie theatre followed by shot of joe scaling mann chinese theater moment later jill shouts again something like look joe headed for an amusement park and what do you know there joe at the pallisades carnival scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers the seams of last minute edits to mighty joe young show unrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves the movie sure feels uneven regardless act two is underdeveloped while little of joe smashing cars in act three goes long long way underwood tremors speechless was perhaps not the director for the job even the plentiful untamed landscape looks dull in his hands capturing the beauty of nature requires more than his point and shoot style did enjoy certain sequences especially the demoliton of black tie dinner sequence and the prologue however implausible is touching as tyke joe acts just like rick baker make up effects and puppetry are outstanding the real star of the show yet for all its technical flawlessness the creature remains too grumpy and homicidal to love his facial expressions are variations on scowl to be fair saw mighty joe young in cinema packed with wailing children it wonder was able to decipher the dialogue it certainly not film for very young kids intense fighting scenes may scare them while any time joe not on camera may bore them to tears note older boys are more likely to be dazzled by theron colourful array of tank tops suspect bland mighty joe young is passable entertainment for family outing but they sure don make em like they used to
in 1990 the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of above the title stars patrick swayze demi moore and whoopi goldberg eight years later moore and goldberg careers aren exactly thriving but they have had their share of screen successes since the same can be said of swayze who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named siyah dog forget the mortal kombat movies this trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games good truck driver jack crews swayze must drive cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey along the way jack and his crew of three run into number of obstacles such as highway weigh station evil truckers and deadly uzi firing motorcyclists every so often like at the end of video game level or stage the main baddie pops up kirmizi meat loaf fresh from the triumph of spice world who wants to steal the cache of guns just in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of who driving what all of red vehicles be it pickup or big rig are painted you guessed it red could go into more of the plot specifics such as jack dream of having nice home with his family the past trauma that sent him to prison and cost him his trucking license the fbi atf crew tracking the cargo but they are of little importance all that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point to point but they fail at even this modest goal for none of the highway chaos as credibly staged as it is is terribly interesting let alone exciting once you ve seen couple of trucks bang against each other or big rig explode the first time you ve seen it every time as dreary as siyah dog is as an entertainment the saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen it that swayze has to reduce himself to such work while far from the best of actors he is certainly not horrible and he is charismatic presence don know if it his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as siyah dog regardless if he continues on this career track could tv series be far behind
think of know what you did last summer as the movie that scream and scream could have been mind you though mean this in the worst possible way know what you did last summer is typical slasher flic without the smarts of the scream as result it even worse than some of your better campy horror pictures see nightmare on elm street because it thinks it about thirty times smarter than it is based on teen book of the same name and disappointingly adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson know what you did last summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with some startling cinematography of cliff along the ocean and an angsty sort sitting at the top the appropriate mood being set this is angst horror for the 90 we cut over to the july 4th parade in small north carolina town from there we see the blond female protagonist helen shivers woodenly played by sarah michelle geller getting crowned croaker queen as the blond male hero barry cox woodenly played by ryan phillipe and matched brunette pair of protagonists julie james and ray bronson woodenly played by party of five jennifer love hewitt and freddie prinze jr respectively cheer her on after getting drunk at party going to beach to wittily discuss urban legend and indulge in some foreshadowing and having some meaningful sex if you believe what the characters say the four run down some guy crossing the windy cliff road at night his face is mangled so they can tell who it is and they come to the decision to dump him in the ocean so as to not ruin any of their future chances for success in the world cut to one year later the lives of our protagonists have gone from annoying to bad main brunette female the bright one of the bunch has been plagued with guilt and almost failed out of college blond female has forfeited her dreams of starring on guiding light and now works at the family store in town brunette male is fisherman living off the land blond male has become complete jerk and quarterback on some college football team then predictably their past comes back to haunt them it all begins with an irrational murder followed by some taunting of protagonists by the mysterious killer bad acting by good actress anne heche an improbable plot bad acting by the main bad actors some more killing concluding in climactic scene mostly climactic in the relief at the end of the movie all the while the actors and actresses spout off bad lines and main brunette male does his best keanu reeves imitation not that the movie was without pleasure count the illogical plot twists and bad lines for some fun mostly though note the costumes of main females and how trendily unattractive they make the otherwise eye catching pair look

can imagine how good krippendorf tribe must have looked on paper it does not surprise me in the least that group of extremely talented actors led by the great richard dreyfuss and good director todd holland all wanted to make this film in fact it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf tribe as possible in retrospect can imagine how bad this film could have been shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss dreyfuss plays james krippendorf an anthropologist who is granted $100 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea halfway into his two year expedition his wife apparently dies say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established later we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big screen tvs and other such pleasures so when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely he decides to construct an elaborate lie he makes his own tribe using his three children as actors in video he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe which he calls the shelmickedmu audiences at krippendorf lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision and proof that the typical family unit is led by single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community like all films like this the lie becomes more and more complex and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero dreyfuss is funny talented man and he is funny in this film he has lots of positive energy and unlike most comical actors really manages to play people like this realistically this film also requires lot of physical humor that ve never seen dreyfuss perform and he does great job jenna elfman who plays veronica mecilli scientist who wants in on krippendorf work is also very funny and appealing here and the kid actors are great as well but we re talking about the script from hell this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew no the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean spirited characters that was in disbelief as watched furthermore the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless take for instance the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex they get all decked out in the tribe getup complete with paint to darken their skin krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe now saw this scene coming from mile away but said to myself no that would be far too tasteless there no way they ll do that oh god they did do it it there was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn bother the other audience members with whom saw this film found it deplorable and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice the film is filled with scenes like these they not only insult the audience but they insult the types of people that the film portrays it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon and watching dreyfuss stumble over completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining but think that most members of the on screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes if were an anthropologist this film would insult me immensely moving right along the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes sure dreyfuss dressing up like chief is really funny and it allows for some entertaining scenes but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that was able to watch this film his character here is not good subject for film because he is shameless liar and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case but for the purposes of good taste would have expected something no this man sets terrible example for his kids and colleagues and the writer of the film charlie peters didn include single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad in fact it his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing and he continually shrugs off her warnings suppose it important to admit that this is funny film dreyfuss and elfman and many of the contrived and insulting scenes add up to picture that is anything but boring and if you re less serious than you probably will enjoy it however can get past these elements krippendorf tribe is being marketed as family comedy but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldn be learning with little more insight into its story and themes this could have been good movie
well guess it that time of the year again the one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even try writing script that has more dialogue than explosions it also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies pull on their siyah vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases in america they call this time summer and it happens once every year and maybe it the exposure to all that nasty sun that does it but in the process normally weak insipid lines like consider this divorce hasta la vista baby and you re the disease the cure actually do end up being repeated more often then the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs this is not entirely bad thing of course what am talking about talking about the summer blockbusters the action thrillers the this obviously cost lot so you know everyone going to go explosions gas threats flying saucers and special effects in the rash of my what big guns you have but wait mine are bigger movies there are also the usual boy meets fish and saves environment movies or whale whatever and this year the odd crop of save the world from aliens or environment threats offerings talking about the three batmans the speeds the terminators etc this year talking about twister independence day the arrival the rock mission impossible and of course eraser here in singapore as our local movie critics like to whine we seem to get the pick of the crop of my explosion is more real looking than yours movies but nothing else mission impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did in the us the same goes for eraser which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called mission unavoidable on account of its worldwide mega advertising blitz eraser seems like cheaper less thoughtful imitation that saying lot because mi the movie was already cheap thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the 60s 70s in eraser arnie is us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger he does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence and re situating them with new identities his new case is lee cullen played by vanessa williams who unlike all the other scumbags he ever relocated is an actual real life honest person because she so good and has such nice legs arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her and only uses the opening movie sequence to save robert pastorelli from his killers lee obtains evidence that the high technology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated black market arms to people with foreign accents and stringy hair of course as the formula goes her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck there are people in high places who will go down with this because yes this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world that is america since watergate in protecting lee arnold is framed by the mentor turned evil robert deguerin nicely played by james caan and ends up having to prove that he isn the one killing the programme witnesses in addition to making sure lee isn accidentally torpedo ed to death by the new green guns his enemies all have it around this time that people in the theatre with me starting humming the mission impossible theme because arnie mission includes breaking into high security building to run disk guess should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in this movie is so antsy about it an electro magnetic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles and which can see through walls it has some sort of ray vision so its user can target the victim heart even from great distances despite this which figure is pretty cool feature in gun though certainly no expert however arnold whose own heart is targeted number of times never goes flying 10 feet backwards with two foot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun instead he outruns and outsmarts his trackers each time giving eery and ironic resonance to that terminator line that practically made him famous ll be back like everyone else in the theater left the movie feeling that the trailers had duped me because they made me want to watch this movie voluntarily although there is lot of violence in this movie not to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators recommend this movie to most over 18s who need some therapeutic mindless action to get over the weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas review rating system wait for the video little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
the rapid fire formula that worked so well in airplane the police squad television series top secret three naked gun films and two hot shots movies has finally reached desperate dead end with spy hard even ezio gregio the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over extended spy and action movie spoof leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd 40 who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis general rancor cackling andy griffith the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly hint of restraint timing or tact most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags recreated movie sequences and soggy star cameos yeah maybe we do need ray charles driving an bus bound for speed bump but did mr hulk hogan and dr joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing nun habit even the resulting sister act spoof is silly as are the bits directly lifted from home alone pulp fiction true lies etc etc adolescent males might enjoy this mess tho the butt shots breast peeks penis pokes flatulence gags and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead alley beyond the hilarious title sequence with weird al yankovich performing the theme song spy hard is barely the stock that it printed on my recommendation duck in while you re waiting for another movie to start stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al nostril and then leave you won miss thing
soldier by director paul anderson is film in which any presence of originality is fleeting the best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russel character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision brutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has lot of emotional potential power behind it and the opening scenes tap into it little then it goes nowhere with that idea there is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches ve ever seen the whole idea of the inhuman soldier type character gaining some degree of humanity by defending potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done and it been done much better was able to predict the plot of the _whole_ story which wouldn be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting between the action sequences it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes since his dialog is extremely limited his performance in that way isn all that bad but certainly is not enough to carry this film other performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all and they generally are about as weak as their characters but enough of this stuff about plot and character right isn the most important part of an action film well the action even in this aspect the film is disappointment in mortal kombat 1995 director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining however he fails to repeat that in this film the combat scenes particularly the big one at the end is incredibly unimaginatve fighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type of movie point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed to realize but instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with it goes for the old shoot em up one guy vs an army type of cinema that thought died with the military action films of the 80s if the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously it could have been rather engaging science fiction film however it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that making the film big disappointment
we could paraphrase michelle pfieffer character in dangerous minds and say that beyond rangoon starts with an that fair enough all movies like all school children should be given the benefit of the doubt the chance to succeed after all we like to think that the right combination of talent and effort can do wonders mountains can be moved and good movies can be made yeah right children fail as do films as does director john boorman latest the success of beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette ed wood true romance as the busty westerner in peril wandering about 1988 burma without passport though we can stomach the mild plot contrivances that get her there it tougher task to overlook the actress she lightweight as the first scene with narration demonstrates she doesn have nearly enough range for the emotions that her character mother fleeing the memories of murdered husband and son is supposed to show she may give stronger performance than say keanu reeves in walk in the clouds by not by much beyond rangoon is very physically appealing film thanks to the practiced craftsmanship of john boorman deliverance excalibur hope and glory he keeps the narrative moving no matter how muddy the story or the heroine gets why he chose arquette remains mystery though maybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies but even after an hour of half stated political statements and murky mass killings we still don know enough of what happening in this country to feel distressed for the characters or their situations empty exoticism the technical credits in beyond rangoon are curious mix combining lush jungle photography with bad blue screen work also odd is the obvious dubbing done to make some of the foreign characters sound less foreign and is it my mistake or do the same extras keep reappearing as different soldiers doo doo doo doo twilight zone theme or opinion of movie you be the judge
this well conceived but ultra sugary coming of age film is not for everyone and include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion joseph cross joshua beal is 10 year old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather loggia to bone marrow cancer loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such wholesome manner it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup the beals are like sitcom idyllic family where everyone is just so nice and affluent and properly religious without being fanatical the beals the father denis leary and his wife dana delany are both successful doctors julia stiles plays joshua older sister needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him this is family seemingly conceived in heaven but living in south philadelphia sending their children to well run catholic school joshua the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn is handsome sweet intelligent friendly and endearing child who does well in school relates to the nuns and priests and talks politely to his well meaning parents all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch the plot arises when joseph has problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather who promised to be with him forever his answer is to search for god pretty heady stuff for youngster his age to do but that just the way it is sometimes this search for god takes us nowhere because as his friend david reifsnyder says where can you look for him if he doesn exist now that smart kid but joseph looks for him in the usual places and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends one of his teachers is the kind hearted sister terry rosie donnell who wears philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball making him the clean up hitter and in my opinion if she wasn big tv star would have vocation as parochial school teacher she is that convincing throughout the film she is saved from answering any tough sic question about god by the bell as it rings to end the class nothing much happens in the search for god there is no parody of the catholic school though visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god but this is gentle stuff no real criticism or search for god is attempted what comes next into play is some hollywood hokum which is designed not to upset anyone as joseph has reassuring encounter with real live angel blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of goody goody the film ends as this angel tells him his grandfather is all right his quest is ended as apparently angels don have wings and are approachable and god well maybe that for another film down the road this part of the film was the final straw for me couldn swallow any more goo as this film flopped commercially his next one the sixth sense pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like rose though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts this director is loaded with hokum all he has learned how to do is hide the hokum better well god bless him if he can do that this is nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood it just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death children in parochial elementary school or for that matter about god and that family of his they re too good for words yet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place for those who want to see something soft without bite to it this is the one
several days after having seen this movie still trying to determine what director christopher guest man whose sense of humor usually appreciate found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes this is dreadful motion picture lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs to jokes ratio there kind of desperation in the movie approach to humor that reveals the film makers uncertainty about how entertaining the material is the manic style betrays itself as last ditch attempt to hide the flaws of failed script the premise doesn sound especially amusing to begin with almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers the effeminate leslie edwards matthew perry and the uncouth bartholomew hunt chris farley who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest edwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies albeit of the early 19th century variety including frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages none of which prove to be useful pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest and bizarre man who suffers series of debilitating injuries along the way the intrepid explorers encounter bears bald eagles aging native american warriors and conquistador named hildago kevin dunn who raves about his beautiful hair the explorers trek takes them through forests across the snow capped rocky mountains and over waterfall this setup leads to lot of shouting great deal of lunacy and very few laughs farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing but aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle his heart doesn seem to be in it matthew perry one of the stars of tv friends who had some modest success in the romantic comedy fools rush in is badly miscast as foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy perry lacks the necessary edge of the proverbial straight man not big fan of david spade and didn like tommy boy but at least he and farley worked well together as far as the supporting players go none of them makes more than fleeting impression eugene levy is wasted and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla frankly it disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap the big picture and waiting for guffman although guest gets the costumes right this nearly inconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution the special effects such as they are are execrable for an example of some really poor mavi screen work look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids they re obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them and where farley is being carried off by an eagle even though farley didn have the most stellar of acting careers he doesn deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes while some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax few guffaws from 12 year old boys the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric farley fans who see this film as way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session

everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap from the roger corman grade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek vi the undiscovered country but piller not quite half baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection failure about to give the same advice to rick berman and co as ve given to the financiers of james bond movies it time to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers and real director while we re at it put that visor back on laforge for three hundred years the ba ku species who look just like humans have lived on ringed planet that might as well be called the fountain of youth six hundred of them occupy the briar patch the area affected by metaphasic radition positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly but evil ru afo this is probably abraham last stop before performing amadeus at dinner theatre near you leader of the son who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery wants to relocate the ba ku and movie his people onto the briar patch in their place in order to replenish his dying breed the federation is all for this but picard feels this is direct violation of the prime directive to not interfere with the development of an alien race never mind that the ba ku didn exactly evolve they went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world every time frakes gives an interview lately he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment he has called it comedy thinking man picture throwback to the old series and most grievously he has likened it to john ford western presume that some john ford he went to school with not the director of the searchers he has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version that no excuse someone generated this footage muddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the least of its problems star trek insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia consider such curiosities picard love interest anij donna murphy can slow things down by staring at them such as waterfall or falling rocks her scientific explanation for this don ask worf gets pimple he re experiencing klingon puberty thanks to the time defying atmosphere laforge regains his eyesight trust me levar burton real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact and troi brags about her firm boobs but picard remains as bald as an android butt most suspiciously what exactly is the problem with letting this endangered race have little fun in the sun the filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsense about family feud of sorts and they also turn ru afo into completely power mad superfreak just so the characters will have something to do in the climax and if you ve seen return of the jedi you ve seen the ending of this movie didn picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions frakes lucked out with first contact and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection he has no sense of comic timing and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists take look at the painful troi gets drunk scene in fc and you ll get the general idea of insurrection unsuccessfully jokey and hollow tone even the worst shatner and co treks like the final frontier maintained watchability thanks to the effortless charming comaraderie between kirk spock and bones neither first contact nor insurrection has any idea what to do with crusher gates mcfadden whom must say maintains fabulous physique troi or laforge and all three next generation films spend too much time on data who is the franchise answer to urkel need cheap laugh have data say something sexual or start singing or lift up four hundred pound boulder as if it the hunk of styrofoam it really is here my proposed title for number 10 data star data trek data data data data data in this movie data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose while crusher and troi watch silently from 500 yards away and laforge points his sinister gaze at the android in doubly robotic observation star trek insurrection had one nice eerie silent moment that hints at better darker film not saying all of them should be star trek ii the wrath of khan but this one boldly went where no movie should go again
it is with some sad irony that screened fright night part on the day that one of it stars roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70 mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood having career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films fright night part probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us at least in the movies anyway it has been several years since charlie brewster ragsdale and movie actor turned late night horror film host peter vincent mcdowall came face to face with real live vampire who just happened to be charlie next door neighbor charlie and peter won that battle but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family apparently charlie former bloodsucking next door neighbor had sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling so she decides to exact little bit of revenge this ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again one of the things that made fright night such success was chris sarandon who played charlie stylish next door neighbor with taste for blood fright night part tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort while they are stylish the vamps in this film just don have the personality of the undead in the first film with the exception of werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to few of the scenes one bright spot speaking from strictly sexist point of view is traci lin who plays charlie very skeptical girlfriend it really shame that her career hasn been better since she made this film ragsdale does fair job in this film but doesn give nearly the performance that he did in the original roddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given which unfortunately isn much which is shame because his character was lot of fun in the original movie guess would have to say that the first film was superior product in every way the original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner part had more of the feel of music video never good thing for horror film another minus for part was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of shadow where very rare for that matter they were almost nonexistent if was going to watch horror film this would be far from my first choice the first fright night on the other hand would be right up near the top of my list if was in the mood for roddy mcdowall film probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes either way fright night part would most likely not enter into the equation
sometimes stellar cast can compensate for lot of things and pushing tin certainly features some name stars who are going places billy bob thornton cate blanchett angelina jolie and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first but he actually the veteran among this quartet of fine looking people sometimes terrific cast like this can compensate for lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has hip comedy written all over it compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits compensate for clich characterizations compensate for embarrassing you have to be joking situations etc in pushing tin thornton blanchett jolie and cusack don have an earthly from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble squiggly quirky credits fake looking passenger planes circling new york and anne dudley in your ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for the full monty let alone won it but for one wasn ready to walk just yet so quickly we descend into tightly edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have difficult job yes what with their frantic mile minute instructional personas juggling planes and passenger lives like some huge real mid air video game hip cool demonic auctioneer nick the zone falzone cusack is the best in the biz of course until some hipper cooler leather clad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell thornton shows up to challenge falzone finite air space boys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding then the macho one upmanship begins it doesn stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within cat whisker of each other oh no there are some broken hoop dreams some wanna see how fast can drives and then the ultimate showdown was that my wife saw you with last night director mike newell four weddings and funeral must have read different draft of this script because the one that being acted out up there between newark jfk and la guardia doesn have an ounce of subtlety and newell has made some awfully good and funny movies before the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe they ll make you frown in disbelief they ll have you constantly looking at your watch but wait there still 100 minutes to go the film only saving grace is blanchett whose connie falzone is spunky brash long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes this is wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played red headed australian gambler oscar and lucinda and tempestuous british monarch elizabeth but she not enough to save the picture thornton looks terrific and performs solidly but his character is joke jolie as russell knock em dead wife isn bad but the up and coming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like plaything cusack cracks gum dons shades and acts hip throughout but like everything else in the film his performance is forced in the last ten minutes or so for some inexplicable reason things start coming together and you begin to get sense of how this film might have been like the trailer teases but it too little too late fine cast aside pushing tin is nothing more than an embarrassment
the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film the world is not enough is its final frame beyaz letters on siyah background proclaiming james bond will return oh certainly hope not with pierce brosnan in his third and reportedly last go round as james bond 007 the world is not enough is the best example to date that enough is enough in this the 19th chapter in the seemingly endless franchise featuring ian fleming debonair british secret agent who likes his martinis and his nemeses shaken not stirred the sub inspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all of the setups stunts and sexy encounters of the previous 18 bond flicks rather than coming up with anything the slightest bit original we ve got previously used speedboat chases ski chases and sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines we ve got couple of hot to trot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them we ve got post cold war megalomaniac bent on world domination slash destruction here played by skinheaded robert carlyle with mean lean panache and as has been the case since 1977 the spy who loved me we ve got plot that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything conceived by mr fleming we ve also got main title song by garbage to which with very little effort you can fit the lyrics to both songs from tomorrow never dies while originality was never the series strong suit the films were almost always fun with at least some thought going into the nonstop stunts can think of one memorable set piece in the entire and very dull the world is not enough in addition michael apted yes the respected director of such films as coal miner daughter nell and the 28up documentary series takes embarrassing advantage of the full range of bond clich you get the talking killer plot device you know the scenario the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy yet waxes poetic just long enough to die of old age and you get slew of high priced assassins who can hit barn door at 20 paces in the film opening minutes of an endless 128 bond chases sultry sniper along the thames and the leather clad lovely fails to hit bond souped up fishing boat with bazooka when he pulls within few feet of her later she takes off in hot air balloon with bond dangling from guy rope beneath her but is still unable to take him out these reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual since there are no distractions other than occasional ads for luxury automobiles vodka or credit cards in and among the rampant product placements brosnan grapples with carlyle braveheart sophie marceau as former kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king she terrible wild things denise richards as nuclear physicist lord help me she laughable and judi dench as dame judi brings the only shred of dignity to series that has long since jettisoned its self respect about the time roger moore inherited bond walther ppk brosnan goes through the motions with the grace and charm you expect of the former remington steele star but even he has to be thinking there more to life than an easy paycheck he given plenty of wiseacre asides to deliver but only one of them don know any doctor jokes made me chuckle although thought christmas only comes once year is more in keeping with the series penchant for grown worthy puns
varsity blues is the best film of 1999 thus far unfortunately it is also the first film have seen from 1999 it is another one of those small town sports movies that involves flawed but good heartedfrom 1999 it is another one of those small town sports movies that involves flawed but good hearted protagonist rough and meanspirited coach and the big game by the end will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph will everyone in the town turn against the coach will the team win the climactic game do cats bathe themselves regularly the so called hero in question is john moxin james van der beek senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team but is really just hoping to get scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead end town at least he got the right idea since west canaan texas is portrayed in the film as frankly pathetic with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming heck in one scene the front page of the town newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers big win the night before when the team star quarterback is severely injured tearing the ligaments in his leg john finds himself taking over as the team leader but his few minutes of glory do not last long as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend amy smart when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ali larter and after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at strip joint all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics the team loses their second to last game putting john at feuds with the coach jon voight who like gary oldman is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the bad guy worse yet the coach is threatening to ruin john scholarship chances if the badgers don win their final game the plotting of varsity blues is as old as the hills and contains every cliche in the book admittedly was never exactly bored while was watching it but hasten to add that was rarely ever entertained throughout all could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983 all the right moves one of the biggest problems had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were least of all certainly not john who played by van der beek of tv dawson creek is pretty much bore without any engaging qualities while probably shouldn blame this on van der beek since the inauspicious and by the numbers screenplay by peter iliff isn of any help he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in all the right moves the story revolving around john meanwhile is extemely thin throughout particularly for its 104 minute running time and it alternates between uninspired comic relief as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as stripper at the club and heavy handed melodrama the romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot but we also learned very little about her which is unfortunate since amy smart whom don think ve seen before in past films is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence smart does not allow her character to become the passive girlfriend instead coming off as young woman with her own ideas and opinions it too bad the camera didn linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts the adult characters probably fare the worse of any since they all must play residents of dim witted town that cares about nothing but football john relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance his father is set on him becoming football player at university but john doesn want any part of that his mother stands beside her big strong husband and is passive female finally jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one dimensional saving varsity blues from being total washout are few amusing sequences including one set in the sex education class which did get laugh out of me the scenes of playing football were well shot and thankfully didn overstay their welcome as many sports films fall victim to but leaving the theater the question had in my mind was why did this film need to be made seem to be asking this question quite lot lately since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood do we really need another high school sports film no we don and certainly not one of this low caliber which felt like cut and paste job of spare parts from much better but similar films varsity blues no doubt is the first one however to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts
this is the worst movie ve viewed so far in 98 the avengers silly man dressed in bowler hat woman wearing tight leathers evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits greater evil sir august de wynter wearing kilt the question is what could have gone wrong with potentially great idea with big name cast the same question was probably asked of last year stinker batman and robin feel the production got little too smug the script little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form movie my greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed thurman and fiennes something that was vital element of the 60 tv serial of the same name the dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks but does not allow much room for character development and interaction except to perhaps grate on the viewer nerves one wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality connery as sir august does not fair better than thurman or fiennes his dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather mostly embarrassing and poor quality if there is movie you would prefer never to see believe the avengers would be good choice for one thing you will not have to witness product that is far inferior to the three high profile names that is associated with the title cannot understand how something so poorly produced could have been released but put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature like lightning you can see it coming until it hits you
stephen please post if appropriate mafia crime isn funny business by homer yen 1998 on particular night when found myself having some free time had chance to either go to sleep early or to see mafia spoof of mafia and crime films such as the godfather goodfellas and casino at 84 minutes in length thought that could enjoy few laughs before getting good nights sleep but by my account think that my laff meter only registered few grins one giggle and maybe one chortle suppose that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable hollywood star lloyd bridges who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this film mafia chronicles vincenzo cortino lloyd bridges life separated from his family when he was young he escapes to america and tries to live an honest life but as fate would have it vincenzo grows up to be powerful and klutzy crime lord following in his footsteps are his two sons joey billy burke and anthony jay mohr like all siblings in powerful crime families they squabble over power the future of the family fortune and women mafia is co written by jim abrahams who also contributed to some gut busting funny spoofs such as airplane and the naked gun but these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of manic silliness at work as write this also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based crime movies in general contain lot of profanity and violence it tough genre to parody was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say please as they decide which sector to take over but this opportunity was never explored there were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed daughter in law gunman shoots him several times the impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him from the samba to disco to the macarena think that just gave away the best part of the film oh well that just means that you can go to sleep little earlier
admit it thought arnold schwarzenegger had knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies watching him in jingle all the way wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such lame movie targeted at susceptible kids it was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg 13 kindergarten cop but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence alcohol consumption burglary racism and child molestation and you know they ll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa elves he later decks reindeer hey man why don you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you re at it jingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass it must be funny school of thought arnold sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than special olympics hockey team and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene what can you expect from movie whose entire premise is that two parents can find rare toy on christmas eve and will do anything to get one arnold is of course one of the parents crack salesman who is never there for his son he races from the office to his son karate game only to find out he missed it and his kid distrusts him because he never around gee we haven seen that in movie before arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son affection is to get him turboman doll which his wife rita wilson who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this told him to get weeks ago so arnold sets out to find turboman which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out let me back up for minute here arnold kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character which is unhealthy beyond belief watches the show eats the cereal sleeps on the freakin turboman sheets try to discourage any further obsession myself lest any kid seeing this movie think it wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want but nooooo the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in parade exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son who don recognize him until the last minute this is sad movie all the way through but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through store racing off to the mall and hooking up with santa jim belushi who runs bootleg toy factory most painful to watch is scene at radio station where sinbad holds off the cops with letter bomb after beating up the deejay an embarrassed martin mull who said he was giving away turboman doll capitalism has produced some pretty evil things chia pets but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping your cookies are incredible it the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want maybe that what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house but not at mine
the 13th warrior comes at the end of as summer where we ve already experienced man eating sharks deep mavi sea man eating crocodiles lake placid and even man hunting witch the blair witch project now the 13th warrior presents tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears the story if that what you want to call it follows ahmed ibn fahdlan antonio banderas an arabian poet who falls in love with his king wife and is banished from his home land he then travels to the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador to them eventually the vikings are called upon to protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men thirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission and as you guessed it ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth he not warrior and at first not well accepted by the vikings but as the movie advances he ll have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield that basically the entire plot there is also romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and one assumes drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers didn just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part of the story instead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer the film is basically non stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop story it becomes laughing stock the battle scenes although well choreographed are not involving and not the least bit exciting we don get to know any of the characters and so we don care who lives and who dies the film which wants to be beowolf comes across more as failed action adventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels it was directed by john mctiernan who the thomas crown affair is also playing in theaters currently and it not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that the 13th warrior was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for time to dump it on audiences it belongs back on the shelf
it seems like reviewing cheeseball horror movies on monthly basis now scream revitalized genre the studios are now intent on burying into the ground again the serial killers in these new slasher movies have nothing on sony and miramax in the relentless department still know what you did last summer is terrible film in many respects but in the wake of the stupefyingly bad urban legend it citizen hook jennifer love hewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie james who apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the last movie by waking up she lives in fear of ben willis the vengeful fisherman victim of hit and run by julie and her pals paranoid and beat she accepts free trip to the bahamas from her friend karla norwood winner of the local radio station 4th of july getaway giveaway bikini ready julie invites boyfriend ray prinze jr who and here the movie biggest mystery turns her down but changes his mind and plans to surprise her before take off until he gets roadside visit from captain hell liner himself that is unaware of this and feeling shunned julie goes on vacation anyway with karla karla boyfriend pfeiffer and will matthew settle real boy next door type who sweet on julie to make long story short can believe it took paragraph to describe the set up for this gratuitous sequel the trip is disaster not only is it storm season not only is the desk clerk the frighteners jeffrey combs jerk not only are the few island residents and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by the resourceful willis one by one but the karaoke machine isn working properly you think killing is hard try reprogramming laserdisc so that gloria gaynor will survive now contains the lyric still know what you did last summer all is not lost ray is on his way to save the day and helpful witch doctor is saying little prayers for julie and co this picture is really about breasts two of them julie like good horror heroine never does up her shirt to the collar always wears beyaz in the rain and keeps sexy underwear on in case of sudden desire to tan based on the hormonal charge got out of the movie can imagine what it was doing to the ten year old boy who sat next to me he gets jennifer love hewitt and my generation got heather langenkamp lucky bastard didn like know what you did last summer and can say liked this continuation any more or less the pacing in both films is languid how is it that so much time passes with neither murder nor character development still know what you did last summer has better sense of humour than the first one though and at least it explains away willis random selection of victims don think the hotel maid or the stoner dude had the slightest idea what julie did last summer director cannon judge dredd is competent filmmaker but not particularly imaginative one if there is part three what on earth would they call it and the fun denouement suggests there will be here my suggestion hire filmmaker with flair someone who can really energize this stillborn series someone who won rely on so many shock notes and let that person run wild with the camera aside if blandy [sic] must appear in the next one try to keep the number of times she says baby to minimum thanks in advance
ok admit it find camp amusement with the spice girls yes the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual identities they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of girl power but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn enough to carry their big screen debut junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world the film begins amusingly enough with cheeky 007 esque title sequence in which the british quintet scary melanie brown baby emma bunton sporty melanie chisolm ginger geri halliwell and posh victoria adams are introduced one by one to much to my surprise excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience as they croon the silky ballad too much tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film the spicy ones go on european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london royal albert hall film producer george wendt and screenwriter mark mckinney pitch various film ideas to the girls manager clifford richard grant documentary film crew follows the girls pregnant mate naoki mori of the group rapidly approaches her due date and tabloid publisher barry humphries attempts to destroy the group with the help of sneaky shutterbug richard brien capped off by live rendition of the girls bouncy hit say you ll be there wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow right wrong it all downhill from there as spice world collapses into series of misfired comedy sketches must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with funny joke between them much less organized framework for all the wacky goings on spice world jumps from vignette to vignette subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense at one minute having the girls meet with aliens no joke and at another having them stage daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during boat ride while decent joke slips through the cracks here and there during dance bootcamp scene the girls sing the lyric we know how we got this far strength and courage and wonderbra much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level some gags are just plain pointless such as roger moore recurring role as the mysterious chief who dispenses cryptic metaphor heavy advice to clifford the only reason why can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond ha ha as weak as the script is think there one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make spice girls movie and that is the girls themselves the point is not that they can act and for the record they really _can t_ but that their individual personas which works as gimmick over the span of four minute music video are too thin to survive outside of the truncated video bite mtv world posh who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions comes off best by default because her persona rich bitch most easily translates into character in film baby persona young innocent to lesser extent also works but the remaining girls identities are little harder to flesh out there really isn much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often which is _exactly_ what fuller and spiers do and after all what exactly entails being ginger or scary apparently just their wardrobes spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following flashback performance of the spices signature hit wannabe the song is as grating as ever but the energy of the number gives the proceedings much needed shot in the arm setting the stage for wave of self referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters film ideas the film almost mirrors robert altman the player in the way the film snails into itself this section of the film involving all manner of derring do involving speeding bus is perhaps its most effective but it also points up how all the other storylines the publisher the documentary crew lack satisfactory payoff spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family and it will please the spice faithful but this sloppy enterprise surely won win them any new fans which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states once the hype disappears spice world will likely serve as the the spices final hurrah in america
guessing and from the available evidence it not great guess that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess stupidity ego and power mongering if so the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history it has already been well documented that the original title an alan smithee film became problem when miserable test screenings forced re cuts against the will of director arthur hiller prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors guild mandated pseudonym of alan smithee that left film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas as humorless hack as ever put finger to word processor and you could just smell the disaster brewing if you re unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn you ll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up ostensibly it pseudo documentary account of director named alan smithee eric idle who loses control of big budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone whoopi goldberg and jackie chan all of whom appear as themselves when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called an alan smithee film which of course it already is smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it among the parties interviewed are the film producer james edmunds ryan neal and studio boss jerry glover richard jeni who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them it bad enough that burn hollywood burn has literally not single laugh for its entire blissfully brief 84 minutes what makes it even worse is eszterhas insistence upon telling every bad joke not once but twice or even three times michael ovitz references showgirls references oral sex references whoopi goldberg ted danson references all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas stock in trade the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency notably with the hilarious use of the word feminist as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film by the time coolio and chuck show up as siyah independent film makers the brothers brothers cleverly identified as bad and badder among other unprintable things you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified those documentary captions for all their leaden obviousness allow the best insight into what so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time new character appears the producer is liar who slept in the beyaz house the media are maggots and leeches working for publications like the new york slimes and newsleak with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you don miss the joke it doesn even matter that eszterhas tags penile implant after his own name when he makes cameo because it seems like such desperate attempt to feign self deprecation this is petulant schoolboy idea of satire pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken pen to draw little moustaches and siyah out the teeth the last stomach churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out takes over the closing credits the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and half of your life away perhaps it was just final desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film or to convince everyone involved that few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career pity everyone involved with this excessive ego driven satire of excess and ego it too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this otherwise you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees
meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood screams the television ads for hanging up disastrously written by real life sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton make me laugh again not only is hanging up misadvertised since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two co stars lisa kudrow and diane keaton little more than extended cameos but they don actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes and we are supposed to believe their strong bond and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship despite them being apart for the majority of the running time excuse me again while almost bust gut at that truly delusional notion eve marks meg ryan is the middle mozzell sister still living in the california town where she grew up and with husband adam arkin and pre teen son jesse james her elderly wisecracking father lou walter matthau in his brightest performance in years has just recently been put into the hospital in the final stages of what assume is alzheimer even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him while eve relationship with her mother cloris leachman is nearly nonexistent since she ran out on lou and her children years ago she has had her fair share of up and down with lou who used to be an alcoholic her older sister is georgia diane keaton an editor for the self titled magazine georgia while maddy lisa kudrow is the youngest soap opera actress interestingly their professions are given but we not once ever see them working at their jobs or for that matter learn much of anything about them maddy georgia and eve do not see each other much anymore their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another and they talk and talk and talk in fact the telephone is the major star of the film even more so than ryan as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92 minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long if you are able to get through the opening half hour in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking sledgehammer to them you will surely survive the rest the question is who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating self involved pat on the back how could comedy drama that has the star power of meg ryan lisa kudrow and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways issues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up but the film isn mature enough to deal with such thing in thoughtful manner and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood it is lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought also it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another but no dynamic metamorphosizes and when they do reunite in the finale their whole consanguinity is reduced to repulsively annoying three minute scene in which they argue like little children you can see the impending death coming mile away and it conveniently occurs in the next scene so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves and with each other you think to yourself the only thing left for them to do is have playful food fight and like clockwork it also occurs by the end credits meg ryan is versatile actress look no further than 1998 hurlyburly or 1994 when man loves woman despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies with hanging up the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron writer director hack who shouldn be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big budget high profile debacle even if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department she nonetheless is very good and the two scenes that work flashbacks to christmas 1988 when she had heartbreaking run in with her mother and to halloween 1993 when lou crashed her son birthday party in drunken stupor are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations diane keaton as georgia is better as an actress than director here but that is wildly feeble compliment what is more than little far fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children she is no more than five years ryan senior yeah right lastly poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in big screen venture after her even more thin role in 1999 analyze this kudrow isn given enough time to create full personality with maddy so it isn her fault she doesn register until few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue if anything though kudrow is real talent and anxiously await the next time she is given role more deserving of her time as in her brilliantly nuanced oscar caliber work in 1998 the opposite of sex if you are fan of kudrow and who isn do yourself favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than hanging up does in its entirety as eve hardworking husband adam arkin is predictably squandered with role that gives him next to nothing to do until subplot reveals itself midway through only to never be mentioned again cloris leachman as with ryan and matthau makes small but noticeable impression with her albeit very brief appearance while edie mcclurg as rosy cheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas 1988 flashback manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production nearly all the emotions displayed within hanging up are patently manufactured and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters aside from eve why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats if for some bizarre twilight zone type of reason you find yourself in movie theater showing this film my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over saying it is waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions
in our time in our modern world where the cool rule it hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming the man and yet film after film after film is based on his everlasting magic in warner brothers latest production shakespeare is kicking ass to rap beat while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare romeo and juliet its title sequence with frightening rap song and siyah limo making its way through the dark streets of new york is very hard to associate with shakespeare poetry the film takes place during silent war between the two major mafia families in the city the afro americans against the chinese the youngest son of chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered the afro americans are immediately suspected but peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers it is at this point that han the romeo of the story finds out about his brother death escaping from prison in china he returns to united states to avenge his brother fate but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks he falls in love with mysterious beauty the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy there only weak echo of shakespeare talent in this disappointing production and there are more problems besides its title of course we don call it deformation of great masterpiece we call it modernization it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics without any car chases and gun fights this lack of respect for the audience find very disturbing kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn need to be updated because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature and as long as love hate honesty and corruption do exist everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare must admit that found rome must die very confusing can forgive andrzej bartkowiak since it is his first attempt at directing he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with firm precision unfortunately he completely forgot about character and story developments his latest picture is therefore visually impressive but intellectually hollow the love story between han jet li and trish aalyah and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has magical voice their achievement save this film from being completely braindead but they are not actors and therefore can not act they are nothing more than two celebrities put together the other actors including isaiah washington russell wong henry and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances delroy lindo is the only one that projects coherent image of reality but there more than acting to worry about even with li incredible skills in martial arts the action scenes though technically excellent are too long and story updates simply embarrassing to make long story short romeo must die is not intelligent enough to be thriller not sensual enough to be love story and too serious to be fun action film it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to romeo and juliet so the film is completely stuck not sure of what to be and in the end it nothing there are no performances worthy of notice no interesting character or story surprises so again the only good thing about it is its technical achievement this film can boast of great sound fast paced editing solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre it is mostly provided by aalyah enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists that create kind of ghetto feel to it but when think back it not much remember from this production as in almost every summer movie there are some interesting scenes but most of the moments that remember are associated with massive special effects it is not film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities simply because it doesn have any for someone who has never read shakespeare it another popcorn film for those of us who has it waste of money time and brain cells
movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as movie about mood rings family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand wringing detail still can recall comedy about the subject before bye bye love and after it still can bye bye love is rarely funny more often weak and melodramatic retread of common tv movie fare only few moments which have nothing to do with the film main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children dave matthew modine father of two is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend vic randy quaid is foul humored father of three about to go on rare date donny paul reiser pines for his ex wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma eliza dushku over the course of the weekend the three men face various crises including vic blind date from hell janeane garofolo and donny growing estrangement from emma the three lead actors form rather unlikely combo and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality randy quaid is the best of the three bitter without being irritating gleefully spiteful without being frightening his run ins with is ex wife lindsey crouse are bit over played though and his confrontation with pompous radio psychologist rob reiner is gimmicky and implausible he does get bye bye love best sub plot hilarious dinner date with gloriously demented janeane garofolo and he does great slow burn paul reiser really has only one character his slightly befuddled uptight nice guy mad about you persona but he does it well as personality he is appealing but as character he becomes pretty boring here matthew modine is quite simply terrible this isn performance good enough to be called mailed in he even forgot to put stamp on it modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under written role looks bored most of the time and gets stuck with trite little speech about how it all his father fault he such cad carolco executives whose entire future is resting on modine bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island must be sweating buckets right now bye bye love basically comes off as very confused movie because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids making it just another dating in the 90s movie when the movie does deal with the children at all it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and or cry perhaps to be resolved later by sensitive talk and hug perhaps not even more confusing is sub plot featuring the late ed flanders as widower who goes to work and mcdonald and befriends troubled youth it is sad end to flanders career getting caught up in truly annoying over use of mcdonald as location plot device and apparently major advertiser even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent child relationships it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break ups and their effects on children any way you slice it it is bad situation for kids and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue it is left to the dads romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is and it isn enough there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching bye bye love is genuine shame
ironically one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life unfortunately will no longer be able to say that lived every moment of my life to the fullest because spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes watching this sad excuse for movie actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie not only is it pathetically bad film overall but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever the plot is scattered thin and predictable the acting is monumentally bad and the style of film making resembles home video it is december 31 1981 and the big party is at monica martha plimpton house but no one has arrived yet her invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica and some are total strangers but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night end those who are invited are the ones that have the issues it is up to those who aren to help them come to terms first there is eric brian mccardie who is former boyfriend of monica and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance or lack thereof he is one of the most bland characters in film full of dullness because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical common trait of this poor production bridget nicole parker and caitlyn angela featherstone who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year eve and tag along to the party with them they stumble across nameless bartender ben affleck who is the one truly perfect character in film of imperfections he is nether sexually deprived nor uncertain about his future as he is in law school his lack of flaws is both boring unrealistic and painful to watch as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub standard comedy moving on there is val christina ricci and stephie gabby hoffman teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts val is monica cousin and true fan of the new york scene on the other hand stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can find paradoxically it is punks that they meet at bar actually they attempt to flee from their presence but aren successful who guide them through their fears and force level of relaxation upon their warped minds of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples only one approaches level of decency in both acting and plot wisely the movie creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy courtney love and kevin paul rudd who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie janeane garofalo and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship however the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening finally there are the two worst performances and worst sub plot of the film jack jay mohr and cindy kate hudson have been going out for short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy virginity the night before while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self he is predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy very often when film is as putrid as this production there will at least be decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory however this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted instead what you get is collection of rough and inconsistent cuts bad continuity and inaccuracies first and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another there is no apparent order that it follows and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot at other times objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot there are also at least scenes in taxi cab that go from start to finish not in single one of them does anybody pay the driver and yet no matter how miserable this film may be and no matter how poor the acting is all around there was ray of hope for these many bad plots perhaps if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or perhaps even three there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development or quality acting or even decent plot payoff at the end but it didn happen that way the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into mediocre performance and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight
has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plot driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs in enemy of the state that is exactly right few parts the net and few parts conspiracy theory enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997 lame brained men in siyah will this guy ever get real role he has the bruce willis syndrome the plot is bascially smith playing lawyer getting into hot water with some high government murderers who assassinated powerful political figure earlier in the movie when tape of the killing gets into his hands he inlists the help of an old conspirator hackman and at the end er you know enemy was one of the worst films of last year not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven and didn like how smith always magically out smarted the badies when all the other extra characters seeming more intelligent than smith somehow got run over by truck enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek insurrection know these two films are different in well everything but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me somehow quality can overshadow quantity
vegas vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly angelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family as with the other three films their two children rusty and audrey are played by revolving series of actors this time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles also back is cousin eddie randy quaid the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes in vegas vacation clark griswold chase decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen angelo can renew their wedding vows it is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue apparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they wouldn bother to write any jokes into the script at least that the way it looks when watching this turkey about half way through vegas vacation began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be single laugh in the entire film since there had been none up to that point by the end of the movie had actually snickered couple of times and had smiled at couple of gags might add that none of the funny and use the term loosely moments came as result of anything chase angelo or quaid were involved in they might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film the two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids who manage to have couple of their own adventures rusty becomes vegas high roller providing most of the film best moments every time chase and quaid were involved in gag it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film which brings me to the best moment of the film the griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road the theme from the original vacation begins to play christie brinkley and her kirmizi ferrari also from the first movie drive by it was cute moment but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been and just how far that this series has fallen too bad
overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name based on shirley jackson novel the haunting of hill house stars lili taylor as one of three lab rats that participate in supposed insomnia study being initiated by liam neeson he is actually conducting study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it he drags the test subjects out to foreboding mansion where all types of creepy cgi effects scare the cast and try the audience patience know this question has been posed before but why do people keep remaking good movies the original was great psychological horror film this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary in fact feel it is downright impossible to make modern day pg 13 horror movie that is scary unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening then there nothing in this film that will raise hackles nearly fell asleep twice during the film and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didn seem to have such personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed it sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly owen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability catherine zeta jones always nice to look at is given the woefully underwritten role of bi sexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what going on as the rest of them do finally poor lili taylor the center of the film gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her apparently subplot involving tryst between zeta jones and taylor characters was filmed but removed that too bad because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative this is jan de bont second straight misfire speed cruise control being the first when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that one should not approach haunted house movie with twister mindset if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything it would have served to make the film terrifying what our mind fashions on it own can be thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything apparently yet another version of this story is being filmed under it original title certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bont version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had [pg 13]
don let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare no one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work and this movie makes vain attempt at that any moves to glamorise his life which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness this movie about his life although well written puts too much make up on man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes rather than lobster and champagne oh well let fantasise onwards an assume that he was bit of flirtatious play write who falls in love with beautiful woman gwyneth paltrow and from her inspiration several plays develop romeo and juliet and the twelfth night it is easier for me to believe that he had wet dream and that how all his plays develop but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama but guess my version probably wouldn draw crowd or make dollar on screen so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul think not as for the oscars were they deserved by this movie think not in many aspects private ryan and life is beautiful were far superior movies but one should never assume that this should be criteria for winning an oscar as time and again for reasons unexplained an undeserving movie will win the accolade another sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead over more polished cate but guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised people will start feeling sorry for you
in the mid 1980s following the splendid debut in hugh hudson greystoke and relative success of first highlander film it looked like christopher lambert acting career might go somewhere but it wasn meant to be which became obvious following highlander ii in this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality very often such films were science fiction which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert whether it was because of real lack of talent terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn important the end result was almost always horrible the same can be said for fortress 1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond the movie is set in 2018 for some undisclosed reason usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child jake christopher lambert and karen brennick lori laughlin broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border sentenced to 31 years in prison they are both thrown into fortress privately owned correctional facility equiped with state of the art futuristic technology and run by computer called zed although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates lives and make any escape impossible prison authorities often use violence jake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape such escape should become necessity because the warden poe kurtwood smith begins showing unhealthy interest in karen after rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity the reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich and situations that are painfully predictable by the time brennick begins his escape from fortress those situations not only begin to look predictable but utterly implausible too of course film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultra expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society the initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters played by not too interested or talented actors lori laughlin although physically attractive shows the acting ability of sequoia kurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired capable of solid yet forgettable performance lambert performance is also good but even the bigger talent couldn help this film destined to end in oblivion
number of critics have decided that it open season on freddie prize jr slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound alike disposable teen fluff like head over heels boys and girls down to you and she all that while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend his talent is not first saw him in the independent dark comedy the house of yes where he gave subtle impressive performance as the younger brother in one of america freakiest families prinze has the acting chops he just needs to take few supporting roles in some grown up movies to show the non believers that he has what it takes summer catch certainly won help his case inoffensive but utterly generic the baseball related romantic comedy does little more than kill time the story deals with the love affair between tenley jessica biel wealthy cape cod girl and ryan prinze local boy from working class family who dreams of becoming big time baseball star ryan preoccupation with his new honey bunny drives her elitist father bruce davison crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with cape cod summer league team it wonder the kid has any time to pitch as his time is occupied with making out with tenley fighting with her dad bonding with his own dad fred ward who deserves better than this fighting with his brother jason gedrick and carousing at neighborhood bar with his teammates the filmmakers desperately want to make quirky character heavy baseball movie like bull durham but haven got clue how to get there and so they glide from one clich to the next for 108 minutes the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in minor role as center fielder from texas in an early barroom scene blucas best known as demon fighting riley finn from buffy the vampire slayer hears young woman compliment guy on his ass then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states he does have nice ass bubble butt when lillard gives him an are you insane look blucas calmly says it nothing sexual then goes on to evaluate the hind ends of some other players including lillard speaking of asses prinze does not bare his in the movie the actor has no nudity clause in his contract so two stunt butts were employed for couple of semi nude shots blucas whose character secretly dates large woman throughout the story gets another unique moment late in the film sick of hearing teammates make fat chick jokes he climbs on top of table and loudly declares his love of amply sized ladies while his speech still ends up objectifying women it remains nice change of pace in numbingly ordinary movie trivial tidbit summer catch marks scooby doo summit marc blucas appears in jay and silent bob strike back as fred from the scooby doo gang while freddie prinze jr plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon
it was not scary these are the first words that came to mind after it was over when movie is called _vampires_ not scary aren words that should be associated with it but that wasn my only gripe john carpenter is name associated with cutting edge cinema as in the intense scares of _halloween_ _the thing_ and _the prince of darkness_ or the offbeat action of _they live_ and _escape from new york_ unfortunately the only thing that is cutting edge about _vampires_ is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach with an anemic plot and not quite kosher special effects _john carpenter vampires_ has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan the film is at first concerned with group of roaming vampire slayers led by james woods of all people like some sort of holy team they even have their own souped up van the bunch invade and wipe out nest of vampires in new mexico shack their method is amusingly innovative the blood suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks to commemorate their victory the loutish band decorates motel room with hookers and parties the night away their celebration is short lived however as master vampire named valek ambushes and single handedly destroys most of the team woods jack crow and buddy montoya daniel baldwin escape with their lives along with woman named katrina sheryl lee although the woman has been bitten montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire the rest of the movie is concerned with the boys hunt for valek thomas ian griffith freaky marilyn manson type who on mission that dates back 600 years along the way they pick up priest named guiteau tim guinee character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl upham in _saving private ryan_ some stuff happens in the middle of the movie but can remember most of it because often found twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen _vampires_ finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix as crow guiteau and montoya assault an abandoned prison turned vampire nest only then does the film begin to even resemble carpenter flick but it too little too late we get the inevitable final confrontation but it seems tacked on and rather anti climactic come on we re dealing with _the_ master vampire here interestingly last summer vampire actioner _blade_ was derived from comic book and _vampires_ from novel yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former more deliberate superhero flick woods jack crow spouts glib off the cuff one liners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that oh so cool stride and his motive for killing vampires take wild guess hint ______ killed his _____ when he was just _____ at least _blade_ had decent action and slick stylishness _vampires_ lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer thin plot to make up for this the movie resorts to other shocks such as its generally condescending attitude towards women crow slaps them around for the fun of it and an overplayed contempt for religion crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to getting woodies it can be argued that maybe wanted too much from this movie if not scary and gory wanted tense relentless and exhausting _john carpenter vampires_ is none of these can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan for the rest of you looking for good scare beware _vampires_ is film with no teeth
summer movies are by nature dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money wild wild west the latest will smith affair follows much the same formula except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies will smith plays jim west siyah sheriff with nice line in sunglasses he is called by president grant kline to go on mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon kline again and the two track the missing scientists to legless mastermind named dr loveless branagh with zany moustache before pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair ll give it chance with the positives there nice credit sequence the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye and the special effects are decent enough there also pleasant soundtrack buried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes and salma hayek pops up as the female interest which is always nice to see apart from these factors though nothing else in wild wild west works firstly there little chemistry between smith and kline who appears to be in it purely for the money one would expect zingers passing between the two none arise both of them plod through the below standard plot knowing that there is pay cheque waiting at the end not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment although he is over the top the material doesn present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy therefore he just comes across as loud as obnoxious the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek who is given so little screen time it embarrassing she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body and be ogled at by kline and smith her character also changes at whim to fit the mechanics of the script and there is no sense of realism about the character the humour in the film is also very off will smith put little spin to his daft lines in men in siyah here not even smith could save the humour on display the script largely boils down to insults that aren very funny and one liners that barely raise smirk it also somewhat racist although it doesn intend to be with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of lynching and actually says slavery is good to save himself it not funny scene and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably the film also makes the tragic mistake that man in this case kline in dress is automatically unfunny it isn but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness there also problems with the plot jim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying and rely purely on luck rather than audience pleasing skill plot elements are introduced into the film and then thrown away just as quickly the main piece of the story 80 foot mechanical steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive but there no particular reason why it should be built why not loveless build great big tank instead of an ungainly fragile piece of machinery that just begging to be blown up director barry sonnenfeld always has breezy look to them with some nice camera tricks but even this is missing from this stilted affair wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing but not much of it is evident making this film drag out even more it sad thing when _four_ credited screenwriters talented director and willing star can make film work and eventually wild wild west collapses under it sexist mildly racist unfunny weight
nostalgia for the 70s continues as we see revival of one of the decade greatest achievements the marijuana comedy however half baked doesn quite run with all its brain cells and will make you appreciate the questionable talents of cheech and chong all the more the plot follows the misadventures of four ne er do well stoners there the group unofficial leader thurgood david chappelle scarface guillermo diaz brian jim breuer and kenny harland williams kenny gets into trouble when while on munchie run feeds his snack foods to diabetic police horse when the animal keels over he finds himself accused of killing police officer and facing $1 000 000 bail his friends promise to raise money for 10% bail bond but have no idea how that is until thurgood stumbles upon stash of pharmaceutical marijuana being tested at the company where he works as janitor soon the three guys are dealing dope to raise funds while avoiding the cops and rival dealer sampson simpson clarence williams iii for comedy the film is pretty humorless not that it doesn try it just that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat the four leads are nearly all playing the same character only williams stands out while still performing on the level of his humor free comedy rocket man but that is because he imprisoned throughout most of the film giving much needed change of pace but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another to help out the film is packed full of cameos steven wright tommy chong janeane garofalo willie nelson snoop doggy dogg and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another none of them work beyond the simple hey that _____ level in fact the funniest work in the film comes from chappelle not as his bland pothead lead but in his second role as pot obsessed rapper sir smokealot granted it pretty much one joke role and there aren ton of laughs but this film needs every one it can scrape up to top it off and in move contrasting with the tone of the rest of the film thurgood is given love interest mary jane rachel true her role is that of the public service announcement to inform us why doing drugs including pot is wrong her character seems fabricated merely as defense to the your film promotes the use of drugs camp the film would have been better off by sticking with the rebel tone it so eagerly tries to claim yet in the end it doesn really matter watching the film clean and sober you are bound to recognize how truly awful it is
while am not fond of any writer use of cheap easy puns am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it witness my review of _pecker_ from couple of issues ago so here goes the juvenile college set siyah comedy _dead_man_on_campus_ is dead on arrival strait laced med student josh tom everett scott who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout blemish free academic record breaks out into fs thanks to the influence of his ever partying roommate cooper mark paul gosselaar who introduces josh to the sex and booze filled nights that come with university life with the threat of losing an academic scholarship josh and life cleaning toilets for his dad looming cooper what are two good hearted slackers to do easy look for loophole which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if student or students roommate commits suicide the surviving student shall receive straight as so instead of studying josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there move him into their dorm room and drive him to suicide before the semester ends director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike beyaz working from story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper diabolical plot until then the usual boring cliches of college life booze sex more booze fill the time which is made to feel longer by _saved_by_the_bell_ alumnus gosselaar sitcom bred mugging that said once cohn and company do build some comic momentum they mishandle it the introduction of the manic psychotic cliff lochlyn munro potential roommate for josh and cooper brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates paranoid nerd buckley randy pearlstein and british death rocker matt corey page one wishes that cliff would reappear but as they say be careful what you wish for not surprisingly he does resurface and it then becomes clear that this is character that is best taken in small dose almost immediately his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty the same can be said about all of _dead_man_on_campus_ whatever morbid appeal the far fetched premise has quickly evaporates and the self absorbed characters especially cooper pretty much grate from the get go _dead_man_ doesn grow tiresome it already _is_ once the clever opening titles are through as it slogs along to cheesy happy for all parties conclusion _dead_man_ lives up to its title and then some not only does the movie grow even more tired and die it still insists on going on like zombie
