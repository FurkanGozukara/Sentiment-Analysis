quest for camelot is warner bros first feature length fully animated attempt to steal clout from disney cartoon empire but the mouse has no reason to be worried the only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall promising if flawed 20th century fox production anastasia but disney hercules with its lively cast and colorful palate had her beat hands down when it came time to crown 1997 best piece of animation this year it no contest as quest for camelot is pretty much dead on arrival even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre that be pocahontas for those of you keeping score isn nearly as dull as this the story revolves around the adventures of free spirited kayley voiced by jessalyn gilsig the early teen daughter of belated knight from king arthur round table kayley only dream is to follow in her father footsteps and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber gary oldman an ex round table member gone bad steals arthur magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in dangerous booby trapped forest with the help of hunky blind timberland dweller garrett carey elwes and two headed dragon eric idle and don rickles that always arguing with itself kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as fighter on arthur side quest for camelot is missing pure showmanship an essential element if it ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney there nothing here that differentiates quest from something you see on any given saturday morning cartoon subpar animation instantly forgettable songs poorly integrated computerized footage compare kayley and garrett run in with the angry ogre to herc battle with the hydra rest my case even the characters stink none of them are remotely interesting so much that the film becomes race to see which one can out bland the others in the end it tie they all win that dragon comedy shtick is awfully cloying but at least it shows signs of pulse at least fans of the early 90s tgif television line up will be thrilled to find jaleel urkel beyaz and bronson balki pinchot sharing the same footage few scenes are nicely realized though at loss to recall enough to be specific and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic though most are paired up with singers who don sound thing like them for their big musical moments jane seymour and celine dion but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults quest for camelot most grievous error is its complete lack of personality and personality we learn from this mess goes very long way
so ask yourself what 8mm eight millimeter is really all about is it about wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography is it about the business itself how bubbling just beneath the surface of big town americana there sordid world of sick and depraved people who won necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires or is it about those who can those who are in position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see not talking about snuff films supposed documentaries of victims being brutalized and killed on camera talking about films like 8mm and its director joel schumacher with recent run of big budget movies to his credit batman robin time to kill batman forever the client schumacher certainly has that kind of influence is 8mm something you really want to see probably not the first two thirds of 8mm unwind as fairly conventional missing persons drama albeit with particularly unsavory core then as it been threatening all along the film explodes into violence and just when you think it finally over schumacher tags on ridiculous self righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further trust me there are better ways to waste two hours of your life nicolas snake eyes cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether reel of film found in her late husband safe documents young girl murder welles goes about his assignment rather matter of factly and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly almost as if you don need any specialized skills or training to do this welles certainly makes it look easy and cops obviously never look in toilet tanks for clues the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes like george scott in paul schrader hardcore occasionally little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through film projector reminding him of his unpleasant task there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife played by catherine keener who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split level home in harrisburg pa 8mm doesn condemn or condone its subject matter it just exploits it the irony of course is that schumacher and seven scribe andrew kevin walker vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an rated first run hollywood product so we only see snippets of snuff and lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror later it the turn of joaquin phoenix who quite good and by far the film most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again all this to get to the familiar yet offensive revelation that sexual deviants are not indeed monsters but everyday people like you and me neither super nor standard 8mm is shocking only in its banality
so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci fi films such as close encounters of the third kind 2001 space odyssey apollo 13 and contact well whatever it is you sure as hell hope that it would be thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such melange considering the disastrous results we re left with here this is film that takes little bit of everything but ultimately adds up to lot of nothing it like said this movie sucks plot rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 after an unknown energy force leads to loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the kirmizi planet critique extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie uneven would be another the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise the buzz around it had been so so and even the film itself starts off with decent first twenty minutes all leading you to believe that it actually going to go somewhere but it isn long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry colored planet tries too hard to get us into the pain of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix in sci fi movie well don know much of it just seemed like bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and half only to figure out some big secret in the end secret which practically had me yawning with excitement ultimately this is movie that starts off with decent premise joins the crew in their misadventures in space for the main crux of its journey and eventually settles down for one of the most anti climactic endings this side of contact mind you if you enjoyed that film shrug of the shoulders ending you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well of course don remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story ugh what friggin mess films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again didn anybody recognize the crappiness in this script didn they read the bad dialogue the cheezy lines the obvious derivative nature of the work mind you with director like depalma at the helm that ain saying much of course you can really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry connell in this fine crew of thespians nuff said neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film musical score during the last fifteen minutes presumably in order to wake the audience up okay we get it brian this scene is supposed to be powerful wow yawn my ears hurt so is anything salvageable in this movie sure gary sinise does another great job as does cheadle the film doesn completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening and yes the sand twister effect that you see in the commercial is well done other than that guess could say that admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies oops did say admire meant am disgusted all in all this movie delivers very little in actual substance offers two bit dialogue masked in lot of sci fi mumbo jumbo pretends to be deep when really it just sappy and eventually just settles into an ending which other than presenting us with pathetic computer graphic as part of the story gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck go see the ninth gate now there great movie and on personal note think it time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12 minute uninterrupted film sequences and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting
one might expect cathartic viewing experience walking into new jean luc godard film after all he was founding member of the highly influential french new wave he is also an esteemed film critic lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing however his latest creation in praise of love is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit to dissect love into the following four categories meeting physical passion quarrels and reconciliation these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples young adult and elderly it is edgar bruno putzulu self appointed task to capture these moments after recent breakup to define central idea it only when things are over that they make sense whether this project will end up play film or opera remains undecided the thesis is simple enough that if played right it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone instead what ensues is an hour and half of repetitive vignettes the next scene no more engaging than the last only once does any character utter something worthwhile but by the time it happens you re so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it but don fret it will surface again you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film as some fellow critics did and wake up in scene exactly like the one you nodded off in not having missed anything worthwhile but you hold hope for some time the background music keeps you in state of urgency and even suspense for the first few conversations it only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope and with speeches like am thinking of something but can only think of that something when am thinking of something else how can you expect to hold anyone interest to godard credit he certainly knows how to frame scene the siyah and beyaz footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful watching edgar read while walking along train track on mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him and if this film had anything poignant to say you would have which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities the environments be it city or country are impeccably captured in crisp detail but the script never complements them unfortunately godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to siyah numerous times within any given scene sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words the second half is composed of nauseating hyper color that often blurs the image you suddenly feel like doomed character straight out of scanners the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies steven spielberg is picked on in particular while ll grant that this does happen and tend to shy away from watching such garbage it still pointless focus for film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood it just goes to show an intelligent person isn necessarily an admirable storyteller the days of breathless are no more
some movies should just skip my daughter and had really vile time at my favorite martian few weeks back and here comes another disney effects filled live action flick based on an old tv program true the probgram is only 15 years old this time and it cartoon but it cartoon liked and was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen but my daughter really wanted to go and how bad could it be turns out was right mostly inspector gadget oddly enough follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian down to the jive talking side kick at first thought it was done by the same people but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it where formula isn just business it way of life the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits in some parts you can just hear them saying more zany want more zany here and here let have really painful sexual reference for no reason right here make it really painful want the audience squirming in their seats ok that fine but want you to add bug guts what does this scene do character depth but where the zaniness don see zany here if you can make it zany cut it the latter is the only explanation can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie michelle who plays penny gadget niece shines in every scene she in but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor dabney coleman comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film but instead he does the best he can with some really poor lines in few unexceptional scenes he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the gidget bitch from hell town mayor oteri overly enthusiastic and continually self congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland oregon own manic mayor vera katz that had to wonder if the studio wasn poking fun at our fair town or maybe all career politicians are like that must say matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla he appears to have some fun with the film especially as the evil gadget rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film hughley plays the shuckin and jivin vehicular side kick in role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years the dialog is let face it it pretty bad the tag line after major set piece battle is faux pas that makes no sense in context lot of the lines especially hughley appear to be made up as they go along by people with little gift for ad lib about three quarters of the film is somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations not really battles with the evil gadget penny does about minute and half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon let me rage here just for minute michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character she utterly charming and has excellent experience harriet the spy for the part of the pint size detective why she is so underutilized in this film is real mystery the film loses star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting or editing stupidity inspector gadget is missing the long long stretches of potty humor that among other things made my favorite martian so unbearable but it very short movie so perhaps something was cut at the last moment probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits the evil sidekick support group is especially worth seeing and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it onscreen all in all another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films wonder if disney uses the revenues for it generally money making cartoons to produce these losers but if true why if they re trying for another mary poppins they need to find team that can produce one and then give them chance to do it
the classic story the production which ruined it marking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 wells classic new line cinema armed with stellar cast and expert make up effects man stan winston alien predator terminator etc churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel of course the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier movies one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 under the title the island of lost souls sounds like much better title the story begins with edward douglas thewlis un representative sent to oversee peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery kilmer after his plane crashes into the sea douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr moreau who incidently owns the island and also reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize his host reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau lab when monstrous birth was in progress even worse the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal people douglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast people community which considers dr moreau their maker using shock therapy and the law dr moreau has long been able to keep his beast people civilised to some extent but there are few animal men who are just too savage to be controlled the island of dr moreau questions the ability of men playing god dr moreau is man obsessed with creating race of beings which is free from hate and violence but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long moreau has no doubt very interesting premise within its grasp even so the production has failed to make the most out of it there are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is the characters are not prioritized so when the audience is led to believe that particular character is important before they know it he or she or it perishes rather ungloriously at times too perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people especially aissa balk the most human of moreau creations the two very important characters montgomery and dr moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably more screen time could have been used for character interaction and development really would have liked it better if say they delved more into dr moreau obsession montgomery purpose in the story and justification to as why the beast people had to rebel maybe the nature of the screenplay which incidently does not incorporate much action sequences in the film forced the filmmakers to cut long story short and make it more of an action film than anything else it still summer and movies have to be marketable the special effects too are really nothing for anyone to shout about at most would say the beast men looked just bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes this wells classic really has potential to be good film unfortunately after adaptations they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story as third outing the island of dr moreau accomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of `the planet of the apes the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
the world on land it just too big for me starring tim roth pruitt taylor vince bill nunn clarence williams iii rated the legend of 1900s is the year most absurd movie rambling nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth looking wistful as ever as guy named 1900 you heard right his name is in all actuality 1900 he was born on an ocean liner on 1900 uh hence the name abandoned and adopted by danny ship crewman 1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny fear that he might be taken away from him because of visa matters well when 1900 is about or so he starts wondering all around the ship one day he discovers grand piano he sits down and starts playing miraculously what comes out is beautiful group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such young age when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is totally against regulations 1900 replies ck the regulations ho ho ho 1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land when he about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody business onboard comes another musician his name is max pruitt taylor vince and he plays the trumpet after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during storm he sits him down on the piano next to him takes the piano braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall taking them with it how the chair they re sitting on and the piano don separate don know but this apparently isn the kind of thing we re supposed to ask after that 1900 and max become friends max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land but 1900 has no intention of doing so what more he doesn even want his music to go anywhere without him when record company hears about his talents they come on board to make record of his music but after finding out that gasp they re going to make millions of copies he breaks the record the conflict of the movie is that after max unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship gets off himself he stumbles upon record of 1900 music in store the record shouldn exist because 1900 never stepped on dry land and the one record that was made on the ship was broken ladies and gentlemen it mystery the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements we re supposed to be roused by climactic piano duel there isn anything in this movie with the potential to compel 1900 comes off as whiny brooding extremely unlikable man can recall single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo meditation on life ditto for max who doesn seem to have life outside his friendship with 1900 tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as fig leaf there no spirit no gusto to the character he insists that he leads happy life on the ship but to us he is dead pruitt taylor vince is little more palatable at least providing moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up bit the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant leering king of jazz who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel the legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered masterpiece by many this effort is utterly limp and lifeless at once ridiculous boring narrow sighted and pointless this is one movie that should be and will be quickly forgotten
over 40 years ago japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind nuclear testing partly flight of fancy partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo year later gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things new name dubbed english track and raymond burr as godzilla the film took on the rest of the world thirty years later toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things yes including raymond burr and called it godzilla 1985 now it 14 years after toho remake and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run in emmerich godzilla matthew broderick plays dr niko tatopoulos biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of radiation induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states meanwhile tatopoulos college girlfriend audrey timmonds maria pitillo works in new york city as an assistant to big time news reporter she like to be reporter herself and when godzilla comes ashore she figures this is her big break of course with the big guy running amok in the city niko and audrey are bound to cross paths and are joined by victor animal palotti hank azaria audrey trusty cameraman friend and phillipe roche jean reno an operative for the french government whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation premiere movie production companies one would think emmerich could make film truly deserving of the name godzilla he didn right up there with the lost world godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history the plot is pretty much what we expect the big dinosaur like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city and it up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down the script however is painfully bad it fraught with lines so corny they don even belong in movies and includes many character actions which make you think you idiot or you stupid girl suppose when you ve got movie with giant lizard loose in new york any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them but is conveniently able to leap atop others why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him when they could more easily keep track of him by flying little higher and in straight line why do sidewinder missiles which have small explosive warheads blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla why is mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three 18 fighter bombers when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two okay maybe the last one was bit nit picky but hey was on roll broderick is usually good actor but in this film he weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way hank azaria does what he can but don expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage like broderick azaria character is quite simply lacking in color what really annoyed me was maria pitillo who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting casting must have been asleep on this one the one bright spot here is jean reno who oddly enough seems to fit well into role which is often comedic quite unlike what we ve seem him do in the past although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster reno brings style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable unfortunately the same cannot be said of the other incongruities the entire feel of the movie is tongue in cheek and seems to pay comical homage to dozen or so films that have come before it this results in significant amount of parody which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster and ends up just producing mess most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously although emmerich obviously wanted to make fun action picture what good is it to sink millions into cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens if we can take the characters seriously the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don care what happens to them godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be film more light hearted than it should be far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters but here behemoth running through the city there bound to be lot of casualties but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after school joe cartoon syndrome where almost everyone seems to get out of harm way just in time in couple of scenes godzilla briefly breathes fire none of the characters even remark upon this ability nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers it as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes godzilla can do this just like in the old movie consider another punch pulled through creative script writing you can make sequel out of just about any movie but the final scene in this one doesn just leave the door open it opens into hallway leading directly into room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently it made me want to gag emmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in jokes and played this one as straight action film with an intelligently written screenplay godzilla could have been so much more however by confusing the viewer with ton of add ins and parodies the movie ends up being something that just doesn work now if they only had raymond burr
brian de palma the director who bought us carrie dressed to kill and mission impossible is back and has bought all his technical expertise with him sadly he forget to bring good story and believable characters nic cage plays rick santaro fast talking cop who is watching boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne sinise an assassination takes place and santaro tries to peace together how it took place trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy the film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together however the film doesn keep the mystery for long and once the big secret is out concerning kevin dunne the film is at dead end although there are some fantastic shots by de palma including 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film halfway through the film drops dead the problem is that de palma doesn have strong story or characters to work with he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience and quickly got bored nic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters but it no use they are boring faceless and completely unlikeable yes another problem with the film is that there no one to root for we re supposed to be on cage side because his character becomes nicer throughout the film however his change is sadly unbelievable poor gary sinise character is terrible who completely changes throughout the start the middle and the end in an appalling way the film use of flashback quickly gets boring while clever and interesting the first few times it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go they certainly don increase the tension or suspense of the movie there is small thread of suspense running through the film but it certainly doesn make this film powerhouse thriller rather just slightly below average one the script is lousy and contrived the characters flat and two dimensional certainly not good factors for film passing itself off for thriller the most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential there good story buried in snake eyes it just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks it also gives itself away far too quickly rather than leaving the big twist for the end while the performances are intriguing especially by newcomer carla gugino as sexy number cruncher wrapped up in the case there no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is terminal case of style of substance and unless you re big fan of either cage or flash directing should be avoided david wilcock review 1998 you know for kids norville barnes
documentary from the twin hughes brothers allen and albert dead presidents menace ii society about street pimps all of whom are african american an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be is what you get learned that the word bitch is their favorite word as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used it makes for film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say but if one has sense humor for what their lifestyle is about then some of what they rap about might seem amusing they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money it also power trip accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place this sleazy pic soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears these verbose pimps had smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models the feather hatted fur coated diamond ring wearing altin chain wearing flashy cadillac cruising pimp of the late 70s blaxploitation movies like the mack and willie dynamite also used as reference was iceberg slim best seller pimp the story of my life we meet pimps such as fillmore slim note charm red gorgeous dre bishop don magic juan and rosebudd they readily discuss their business arrangements including percentages lifestyles knockin stealing another pimp ho and the thrill they get from women giving them money these dudes needed no prompting to talk as they just love to brag about about themselves priests need nuns yaps note san francisco pimp doctors need nurses so ho need pimps as he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make that the girls need them to show them the ropes how to make money to be their security blankets protectors and counselors the race issue was brought up right from the film onset as number of beyaz interviewees regular citizens note that their impression of pimp is that he the lowest form of human while we are told in the siyah community the pimp is looked upon as successful entrepenaur riding around in fancy cars flashing wads of money dressed in flamboyant style where his snake gaiter shoes might cost him grand and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community we also see that the siyah pimps have number of beyaz girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery of master and slave relations the film was all about pimp style and their projected image as they run hard sell riff about the virtues of their work there are different styles of pimping but the film mentions them only as being macks and players or real pimps and perpetrator pimps but no further clarity is attempted it is also failed to get the women side to this story of abuse primarily taking the pimp at his word the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such perverted way as he does as the filmmakers were taking for ride by the pimps who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing hungry for their 15 minutes of fame the only laughs got out of this bleak look at an american subculture was hearing how few pimps retired and what they are now up to danny brown became blues singer so he could keep his pimp wardrobe while hollywood pimp called rosebudd married his ho and turned square working to support his wife and daughter as telemarketer
my first press screening of 1998 and already ve gotten prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list what an auspicious beginning welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere firestorm the directorial debut of dances with wolves academy award winning cinematographer dean semler is the first of the new year crop of movies as our story opens the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are smokejumpers we then cut to plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl where one of the gung ho guys is taking romance quiz from cosmopolitan having the time of their lives they then jump into the middle of burning forest when even in the beginning the director can get the small parts right you can sense the movie is in trouble with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline filled cars smokejumper monica christianne hirt tells them to get away from their soon to explode vehicles not bothering to shout nor even get close to them she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people miraculously they manage to hear her and move away in movie that specializes in cheap shots the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in nearby burning building as it does throughout overly dramatic cinematographer stephen windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl face our show two heroes the crew chief wynt perkins played laconically by scott glenn and his second in command jesse graves played by howie long in weak attempt to be the next steven seagal enter the burning house looking for the little girl in panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse this mawkish show cuts back to monica who has life or death decision to make the chopper with the fire retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica two firefighting buddies she has only seconds to decide who will be saved yes she goes for the majority but miracle of miracles the other three come out alive anyway not content with traditional firefighting story chris soth screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape hoods in the woods is what the ground pounders yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire along the way shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father who was marine drill instructor most of the highly predictable movie is long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing he flings chain saw backwards over his head while riding speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck arguably the low point is when he escapes from locked burning building by riding motorcycle conveniently parked inside using ramp he shoots straight out of the top of the building attic and when he hits the ground he just rides off in cloud of dust when the film isn using some stock footage of actual forest fires the simulated ones look hokey editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions the ending with its sick twists manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise heard afterwards in the lobby it not as bad as some of the television sitcoms firestorm runs mercifully just 29 it is rated for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers
ever since wargames the first real computer hacking movie hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking these films usually show the audience look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous if it not this the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect hackers is guilty of all of these crimes to anyone familiar with computers and or the internet most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can take it anymore those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web the internet movie database are probably aware of the section for movies entitled goofs this is the section for mistakes in the movies well imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed generally ill informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology and truthfully this is one hundred percent correct the plot obviously centers around computer hacking more specifically it follows the exploits of dade murphy young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting because if it were not for that who knows where his career would be now after hackers the film opens with young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems he was forbidden to use computer until he turned eighteen years old the film then picks up at that point an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn angelina jolie cereal killer matthew lillard lord nikon laurence mason and the phantom phreak renoly santiago who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi oh and as little sub plot dade also tries to woo acid burn the only female hacker in the film really can think of much more to say about the film plot aside from what ve said it just bunch of computer geeks no obsessive compulsive computer geeks little too advanced for reality running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi thanks to this movie the public unfamiliar with computers now has distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do this movie makes computers look little bit too advanced for their time and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list to sum it up hackers is terrible computer film if you re looking for film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world suggest sneakers although at times it too may seem little far fetched it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users hopefully this film didn influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time
nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre frankenweenie beetlejuice batman edward scissorhands ed wood mars attacks yet none of them have been horror films sleepy hollow is his first attempt to actually scare people greeted the prospect with high anticipation burton whole career seemed to be leading up to this left disappointed andrew kevin walker screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story the legend of sleepy hollow in the movie ichabod crane johnny depp is new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate series of murders several of the town leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning he also discovers that the killings are not random that the victims are tied together by secret along the way ichabod gets help from bewitching literally young woman christina ricci and the son of one of the murder victims marc pickering my reaction ho hum the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting that in itself is forgivable hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages however burton attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy it might be his background in his previous movies goofy was the goal along the same lines it doesn help that creature designer and producer kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue in cheek tales from the crypt tv series witch eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit tree spurts blood like it in monty python sketch and the headless horseman well he guy without head on horse boo the performances are also awful although he impressed me with his work in other films depp doesn seem to know what to do with ichabod and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that supposed to pass for an 18th century accent ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic which guarantees that we won sympathize with her character the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee martin landau and christopher walken wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola projected series of gothic adaptations series that produced only bram stoker dracula and mary shelley frankenstein coppola is an executive producer for sleepy hollow and the script reflects his interest in early forms of moving pictures particularly in toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion there bird on one side of the card cage on the other when the card is flipped rapidly the bird appears to be caged bottom line the hollow isn the only thing that sleepy
the happy bastard quick movie review holy man more like holy crap the film stars eddie murphy as mystical ish figure named on strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs jeff goldblum and kelly preston with flat tire on their hands somehow he ends up in their car and on their channel line up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty beyaz morgan fairchild and slew of other celebrities and nameless figures it here that he seems to hit his stride speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales at this point in the movie of course morality comes into play particularly on goldblum who suddenly feels he can market the magical into megabucks to get in good with his boss robert loggia it doesn take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points only real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild face seems to have any interest in the movie murphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if he rather be someplace else some may argue that the movie has message but all that came across to me is that could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat at least he has something for us to laught at
ever watch very young child try and tell joke that is beyond his or her sophistication it full of stops and starts and usually the punch line is ruined felt the same way watching drowning mona skip stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy there are some slightly successful attempts at humor but they only serve as window dressing there is running gag about the town verplanck being test town for the then new yugo everyone drives yugo differentiating their cars with personalized license plates even the police chief drives one there is certain sublimeness to the image of lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets there also is running gag about one of the characters jeff missing hand and how it occurred it pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends it turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend there are some sight gags that pop up as well such as mona tombstone which reads demoted instead of devoted still the core of the story maintains the flatness of still pond the lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona midler each scene with her is the same scream at someone hit someone then scream some more there no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness anyone off the street could have played the role such as it is the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts each one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization there is burly female car mechanic so of course there is forced lesbianism gag mona son jeff marcus thomas is simpleton hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth chief of police rash devito likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter there nothing more to him elle the chief daughter campbell is bland personified dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have child and be married mona husband phil fichtner jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch bob affleck elle betrothed and business partner to jeff is mumbling obvious dullard there is no contrast to any of the characters by having at least one character with some wit or wits to serve as counterpoint to the others perhaps steinfeld attempt at satirizing small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better ostensibly murder mystery drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer who could be anyone due to mona loving manner with everyone on town even that aspect of the film fails throwing in convenient ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things it been while since walked away from movie theater in an angry mood what makes it all the more remarkable is that rarely remember comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it ineptitude
deserves recognition for achieving the near impossible task of making grander monument to self love than steven seagal on deadly ground capsule review question after the floating baby ruth that was waterworld what in the @$&% were the hollywood execs who gave kevin costner the money to make another post apocalyptic movie thinking in this hour advertisement for his new hair weave costner plays nameless drifter who dons long dead postal employee uniform and gradually turns nuked out usa into an idealized hippy dippy society judging by the costuming at the end of the movie the main accomplishment of this brave new world is in re inventing polyester when he not pointing the camera directly at himself director costner does have nice visual sense and it is undeniably fascinating to see such an unabashedly jingoistic film in the trust no one 90 but by the time the second hour rolled around was reduced to sitting on my hands to keep from clawing out my own eyes mark this one return to sender
the second serial killer thriller of the month is just awful oh it starts deceptively okay with handful of intriguing characters and some solid location work after baby sitter gets gutted in the suit ably spooky someone in the house prologue parallel stories unfold the first involving texas sheriff lee emery gruesome double murder and the arrival of morose fbi agent dennis quaid on the eve of voting for the local lawman reelection the second pairs hitch hiker jared leto with friendly former railroad worker danny glover they re headed west toward the rockies and away from the murder scene which one is the killer well it doesn really matter cause when writer first time director jeb stuart die hard finally spills the beans you won take his choice seriously anyway the whole thing goes south about an hour in with the tale taking hairpin turns that certainly couldn follow and through the whole thing there quaid playing with the most intense monotony this side of steven sea gal guess glad that didn walk out there some nice train stuff at the end and fun nod to dr strangelove
five years after his directorial debut based on stephen king writings called the shawshank redemption 10 writer director frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king unlike the latter film this one is big long laborious bore plot seven foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers critique this film is slow drawn out boring uninteresting unexciting predictable and topped with couple of one dimensional evil characters its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles the real miracle of my night was the fact that did not fall asleep during this straightforward unimpressive film about guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about of course much like all other death row cell blocks this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be misunderstood except for one cookie cutter crazy guy who is evil personified and let not forget all the guards on death row who also happen to be angels from the heaven above except for one cookie cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates am supposed to identify with anyone in this film or even more importantly am supposed to give rat ass about anyone in this film well if was sure missed that boat because the only thing that ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin furthermore there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone life to present this story in fact the story is empty within itself truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is guy on death row who has special powers to heal and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not wow how interesting the plot utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film we are told that one certain lady has tumor early on in the movie whip out those thinking caps kids hmmm and wonder what will happen to those two cookie cutter evil guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity hmmmm now think hard here boys and girls what crock am guessing that this film was supposed to be some three hour exercise in spirituality but unfortunately for me it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging in fact it was one big bore didn see the point of the movie didn see the point of the story and certainly didn see the point in tom hanks big double chin all in all bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour john coffey give that man an award or something
working in the motion picture industry must be constant source of frustration for front line african american actress like jada pinkett smith despite being one of the freshest talents available pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts low down dirty shame the nutty professor the problem is of course that there aren many good roles available for siyah women take away the likes of waiting to exhale set it off soul food and eve bayou and all that left is chance to be someone girlfriend local whore or murder victim as result for pinkett smith first opportunity atop the marquee she is stuck in stupid formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo actually woo the latest directorial effort from daisy mayer party girl could have been worse than it is the film offers few funny albeit juvenile moments and the on screen relationship between pinkett smith woo and tommy davidson tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags unfortunately huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with triple digit the situations are painfully contrived the main characters are lifted right out of sit coms and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that wondered whether they all participated in some kind of free lobotomy lab experiment woo is spontaneous energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places her latest relationship with testosterone overdosed drug dealer came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear beeper now her transvestite medium friend celestrial girlina predicts that she about to meet mr right and that he ll be virgo later that day woo is given an opportunity to go out on blind date with tim shy man with penchant for neatness and order who just happens to be virgo it not love at first sight however things get off to rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass and they get even worse when the pair arrives at swanky restaurant to enjoy quiet dinner in the one hundred year history of motion pictures there have been ton of bad beyaz movies about mismatched lovers so suppose it only fair that we get siyah effort of the same low caliber as in all romantic comedies we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together the question is are their courtship rituals entertaining in good entry to the genre the audience becomes caught up in the love story no matter how familiar it is in woo the constant reliance upon unfunny moronic humor sinks the project for those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes there huge one in woo involving corvette with broken window that miraculously repairs itself added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top sadly that one of the film most enjoyable sequences and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional despite exuding charm from every pore there little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david johnson script since it misses the mark by so much better name for woo might have been whoops
darren jason biggs wayne steve zahn and jack siyah have been best friends since the fifth grade like the three musketeers they ve been together through thick and thin but when darren meets an attractive but cold blooded and manipulative psychiatrist judith amanda peet the long time friendship is placed in danger it up to wayne and to rescue their best friend in saving silverman silverman has its heart in the right place but the story by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darren soul based on their experience of friend making major marital mistake the story is centered on the three life long amigos when wayne introduces darren to judith he doesn realize that he has opened pandora box of disaster for himself and judith was once in relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure until he died in kick boxing match since then she has sought new mate someone she can boss around and mold into her own vision enter darren silverman once they realize the magnitude of their error in judgement wayne and try everything they can including threats and bribery to get judith to free darren nothing works until the duo come up with plan kidnap judith and get darren back together with the girl he called his one and only pretty sandy perkus amanda detmer the only problem here is that sandy is about to take her vows to become nun things spiral out of control as judith repeatedly attempts to escape while wayne and play cupid the boys even bring their idol neil diamond into the picture to help resolve things thinking about it this is real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack siyah the pair is able to elicit the film only laughs with their goofy antics and child like behavior they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne the brains of the gang jack siyah has the big guy moves of chris farley giving an amusing physical presence the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material the rest of the cast doesn fare as well though jason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers and gets very little to do though having watched his previous films american pie and loser not sure what attraction biggs actually has amanda peet is caustic as the manipulative judith there is no humanity at all to her character as she single mindedly strives to recreate darren into her mind image she monster that wayne and must defeat to save their friend unfortunately there is no dimension to her character amanda detmer brings nothing or gets nothing as darren one and only lee ermey as the psychotic coach made bad decision taking this role tune meister neil diamond gives good natured cameo perf as the boys idol and savior production values are on par with the rest of the film lackluster and non involving director dennis dugan has track record for broad comedy with films like big daddy and beverly hills ninja but falls flat with saving silverman the 2001 movie year has yet to provide us with good film to sink our teeth into at least with saving silverman we get couple of funny perfs from zahn and siyah too bad that the rest of the film lacks their level of humor kick boxing deaths and conflicted nuns are not the makings of good comedy give it
let me just start this review off by saying am huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years am not too fond of ted turner world championship wrestling however and am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for wrestling movie tonight the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs david arquette aptly cast as neandrathal and sean dawkins scott caan who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than flashy show when they finally get to see their hero wcw world champion jimmy king played by oliver platt personally would have gotten wrestler to play king he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair wasted palitaliano in role originally meant for real life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it they embark on quest to find him and help him get his title back when they find him they discover in horror that jimmy king real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv king is drunken atlanta native rather than an english king after convincing king that they don care that his persona isn real gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro after which sinclair agrees to book him in main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw pay per view gee whiz there are so many things wrong with this movie don know where to begin yes do the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff wcw president who thought up this project thinks of wrestling fans he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously got news for you eric nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that this is 2000 you know not 1985 know he ll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn meant to be taken seriously but it is because that how big an ego bischoff has there was documentary made in 1998 wrestling with shadows that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation vince mcmahon screwing bret the hitman hart out of the title this movie storyline is basically comic rip off of that plot with the poor man wayne and garth thrown in eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart the movie main wrestler jimmy king has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age we want bad asses today why make this comedy instead of an emotional rocky style drama know wrestling isn sport but you can still get behind guy who struggles as wrestler and finally makes it in the end in the movie gordie starts up an ill fated romance with nitro girl sasha the lovely rose mcgowan what she sees in that freak marilyn manson ll never understand only to find that she has hospitalized king trainer for sinclair wouldn it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy girl for the bad guy cliche hate that last but certainly not least there was not one single moment in this movie that could not predict would happen nor did laugh once either the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie for these reasons they re the better promotion they have better and younger talent performers and wrestlers they give their fans what they want and don treat them like idiots they re winning the ratings and they re the promotion everybody cares about simply put they could make movie hundred times better and they could do wrestling movie the right way the only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end and if spoiled it for you good saved you from wasting seven dollars
movies don come much more ridiculously titled than still know what you did last summer but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous the title sort of works as warning more than silly sounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor this horror sequel moniker also contains grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot what you did _last_ summer you actually did the summer _before_ last summer and since knew about it _this_ summer as well as _last_ summer it really illogical to say that _still_ know what you did _last_ summer the filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter still know the longer still know what you did two summers ago or the appropriate stupid people getting hacked to bits that last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart for example if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet even if it was just to locate and borrow cute little dress probably not but that precisely what college student karla pop diva brandy does to best friend julie jennifer love hewitt resulting in the first in long line of phony frights julie you ll recall was one of the sole survivors at the end of 1997 surprise hit know what you did last summer after slasher with grudge to bear it _long_ story began trying to pick off her her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village in this installment the plot picks up as karla wins trip to the bahamas and julie yet racked by guilt decides that maybe tropical getaway will help ease her mind yeah right their island paradise has room of course for one more in the form of the still alive killer muse watson from the first film he sports the same gorton fisherman get up heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity but why he still trying to stay anonymous is mystery this movie never solves though suppose his hook hand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of leisure suit in sense that the movie glaring flaw everybody knows who the bad guy is thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel the murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary but trey callaway derivative still know screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims when julie lays blissfully unaware in tanning bed giving him perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all what does he do he twist ties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays you think he want her gutted now instead of skin cancer victim later even prequel summer lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and few neat shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh the innovative gallows humor that scribe and scream wunderkind kevin williamson injected into know unfolding story is sorely missed replaced with the grating antics of beyaz rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like yo you ll cheer not shriek when he ends up with pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest if know what you did last summer however effective was just the kind of movie that those subversive scream flicks poked fun at then the deadly still know what you did last summer deserves full blown roasting on mystery science theatre 3000
have never been star trek fan and to tell the truth out of the five films in the series that have seen have disliked all of them do however always go into one of these with an open mind and the ninth film in the series star trek insurrection is no exception dropping almost completely the hard core sci fi element of the previous one in the series first contact insurrection tells the story of planet that holds only 600 people known as the ba ku as well as the fountain of youth at the start of the picture the villagers go under attack by second alien species known as the son who want to push all of the ba ku out so that their own race will not die out also attacking the ba ku is data brent spiner robot from the star trek enterprise after returning to jean luc picard patrick stewart and the gang on their space ship no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force so several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the ba ku where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants sultry kind alien woman donna murphy who is over six hundred years old but looks to only be in her thirties star trek insurrection is completely unoriginal and cheap looking installment in the series and is big step down from 1996 first contact which at least appeared to try to make something bit different in insurrection however it plays like low rent episode of the television show due to the small scale generic storyline and an emphasis on one liners rather than excitement the film was filled with nearly non stop comedy and worse yet most of it fell flatter than cartoon character that drops off cliff meanwhile when there were action sequences they were not at all interesting or inventive relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very very slowly this plot device which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays is getting old fast are filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have timer ticking away during the climax another element of star trek films in general is that picard seems to always have to have love interest but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later although donna murphy who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103 minute running time alfre woodard was far superior in first contact she should have returned for this one but don blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movie disappointing and often lifeless screenplay by michael piller star trek insurrection is perhaps the weakest film in the star trek series although have not seen what is widely considered the worst star trek the final frontier insurrection is the type of safe sequel that will bewilder non fans since it is so low tech compared to most of today blockbuster action films although most of these are honestly not very good either and should disappoint the loyal trekkies since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through few more drafts on second thought they probably should have completely thrown the script out that way they could have come up with story that at least had sign of intelligence and freshness
billy crystal reappears in yet another high concept comedy he tries to infuse some life into it but it gets bogged down with sentimentality and lack of sophistication sammy billy crystal is struggling agent at the end of his ropes he separated from his wife serena kathleen quinlan and down to his last serious client in low budget film shooting in romania but in turn of bad luck sammy wrecks his car only to be mysteriously saved by giant gheorghe muresan but this giant has heart of altin he leads solitary life helping out the monks at local monastery his only longing is for his long lost love lilianna joanna pacula who has since moved to america sammy seeing golden ticket convinces max to become an actor represented by sammy of course and come back to america and so sam and max bounce from pathetic job to pathetic job with sammy dangling meeting with lilianna as carrot before max nose but slowly sammy deceptions begin to haunt him but will he develop conscience before the innocent max becomes disillusioned the humor in my giant isn the world greatest mostly it falls under the category of boy he so big and that can only go so far no matter how hard the talent tries still its slightly amusing parts are longed for when the movie gets bogged down in sappy moments the film best moment and that not saying much is bit part by steven seagal playing himself between executive decision and this all of seagal best roles have been cameos maybe he should consider change of work steven seagal the character actor gheorghe muresan isn natural actor at all and his thick cotton mouthed accent certainly doesn help in fact the only thing he adds to the role is his immense stature originally the concept was designed several years ago for andre the giant andre also had hefty accent but he displayed knack for comedy in the princess bride something muresan should have studied for some pointers why does billy crystal continually get caught in these pathetic comedies he proven that he can be much funnier than these formulaic films allow him to be and yet like glutton for punishment he keeps coming back that doesn mean we have to

not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream but guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write second draft seriously this idea psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends is great one and wish it could have been pulled off the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue an example that [car crash] must ve been awful for everyone involved you can tell that the writer intended that something little more airy was supposed to have been said just no one figured out what know in slasher movies there isn supposed to be lot of great characterization and myself don mind cardboard cutouts but please don let the cutouts be so damn bland one reason movies like scream star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters aside from jared leto and joshua jackson who aren on the screen long enough no one in urban legend makes the grade alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive not to mention as dumb as post through of the film and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot good thing brad dourif is here but wait he only in the movie for five minutes _and_ he just redoing his good natured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoo nest which brings me to another aspect of urban legend it unoriginality the film most blatantly ripped off is scream another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after craven and williamson great success urban legend tries to deconstruct modern day folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films but it doesn quite succeed it best stab at self reflexivity is poking fun at that girl in the noxzeema ad ie rebecca gayheart we also have another killer taunting his victim on the phone routine in urban legend and quick what movie is this exchange of dialogue from female protagonist why villain why why congratulations to those of you who answered scream and or urban legend like said this movie could ve been great if only silvio had worked or been allowed to work little longer on the script still at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than know what you did last summer
since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993 steven spielberg drama schindler list and directed 1993 intelligent searching for bobby fischer his new film civil action should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career what doesn make sense is how such high profile and superb actors as john travolta robert duvall william macy and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project which is both dull and completely ineffective the film which involves small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally charged but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings leaving us with nothing more than poorly done courtroom drama based on book by jonathan hart which was consequently based on true account civil action is set in 1982 in the town of woburn mass where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann john travolta decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children death from leukemia due to unknown causes jan originally decides to drop the case but when he stumbles across to corporate giants grace and beatrice foods who have plants located near the families homes he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which thus goes into the city drinking water suddenly after hearing about the families heartbreak and personal stories he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery even though he is warned by his staff accountant william macy that no money is coming in to them only going out also figuring into the story is jerome facher robert duvall beatrice foods corporate counsel who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20 million offer to settle the case coming from such talented writer director and cast not to mention one of the most interesting film composers danny elfman civil action is an astoundingly empty headed drama one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be relatively uncommercial motion picture zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning watching the film couldn help but notice its similarities with 1997 far far superior film the sweet hereafter which dealt with lawyer played brilliantly by ian holm investigating school bus accident that killed number of children in his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident holm interviews the grieving parents as well as the sole surviving passenger teenage girl which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter young drug addict who has run away from home not only was the plotting similar to civil action but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes considering this it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful sweet hereafter was not only concentrating on the school bus accident but delving deeply into ian holm character and his own personal demons as well as the teenage girl in civil action however have no idea where the running time went since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness we do not get to know the parents very well nor any of the main characters through its whole duration did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta lawyer character jan schlictmann who doesn appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job every scene is tediously related directly to the premise and therefore there was no one for me to care about or root for you ve got to work pretty hard actually to not get an audience to become involved in the parents plight since their children are dead but that is exactly what civil action does to be honest would be fairly hard pressed to state an aspect of the film that actually liked aside from one flashback to when man young son died on the way to the doctor remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes and more than once found my mind wandering could say the performances were good but who fooling who since every character is one dimensionally written no one acting abilities are challenged in any way travolta plays lawyer well enough but that about all he does duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role apparently only appearing to give one liners at every chance he gets and what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture final scene as judge she appears unbilled since it is just cameo but why did she even agree to do it in the first place finally when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role the film left me with another question what was the point abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum where none came before that to begin with civil action seemed to me at least to be an example of how not to make courtroom drama and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with
the high school comedy seems to be hot genre of the moment with she all that and varsity blues behind us and several more set for release later in the year the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance however you wouldn know it from the quality of the latest entry jawbreaker this shockingly bitter candy definitely has sour center the most popular and most feared clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma they have accidentally killed one of their own the teen dream liz purr charlotte roldan choked on giant jawbreaker during kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday now the three surviving girls must decide what to do it takes little time at all for the group leader courtney rose mcgowan to decide to cover it up the ditzy marcie julie benz is game to go along but the clique final member julie rebecca gayheart has guilty conscience to make things worse another student the hopelessly geeky fern mayo judy evans greer accidentally discovers the truth the girls cover is surely blown not so fast thinking quickly courtney offers fern once in lifetime chance after quick makeover fern is transformed into vylette the beautiful new girl at school and full fledged member of the popular crowd does this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder or will this finely honed plan crack over time jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation and failing miserably might add it manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations but misses three crucial elements sharp dialogue witty characters and the much needed humor it is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being darkly humorous if it wasn shackled to its dead weight plot the film most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo at this point jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths but then all of sudden the innovation stops the film becomes mired in the murder and cover up plotting which quickly saps what little life and energy there was right out of the film in the film rose mcgowan fares the best as the manipulative clique leader she truly dominates every scene she in not difficult feat in crowd such as this however it character crying out for better movie or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact jawbreaker doesn quite know how to handle its semi likable characters fern and julie either one could effectively end the movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows the lengths to which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters as their motives become murky and unclear the film finally falls to the point that it doesn really matter who wins or loses since all sides have become equally detestable detestable is good word to describe the film jawbreaker it certain that like the murder weapon described in the film title jawbreaker will be triggering more than one gag reflex in the audience
inspired by the 1958 film house on haunted hill starring vincent price directed by william malone starring geoffrey rush famke janssen and chris kattan rated contains violence profanity and brief nudity synopsis eccentric millionaire price offers $1 000 000 to each of his guests who appear at gathering at former sanitarium the only catch is that they have to survive the night at the establishment an establishment haunted by its former staff and patients comments house on haunted hill is based upon the original 1958 film of the same title directed by william castle and starring vincent price in an obvious homage the millionaire name is price and he sports thin mustache like price used to have this is pretty bad horror film yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining and house on haunted hill is just such film it is surprisingly better than another recent haunted house remake the haunting film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson the haunting had literary pretensions and fell flat on it face house on haunted hill owes its lineage to movie 40 years old and makes no illusion that it crappy horror movie thus somehow it proves slightly more successful can think of another recent film which has had such an eclectic cast it is this cast which lifts this ho hum thriller into borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror price the main character is played by geoffrey rush the academy award winning actor of shine rush seems to be making downward spiral in the movie industry spiral reminiscent of ben ghandi schindler list kingsley ridiculous appearance in the camp sci fi classic species don know why but sometimes it entertaining to see quality actors in bad movies more surprises rising star taye diggs plays stereotypical african american sports figure rather lamely too and singer lisa loeb appears as tv news reporter the highlight of the cast however has to be saturday night live member chris kattan kattan comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor of the former sanitarium while the first half of the film leaves the audience guessing as to what exactly going on the second half dissolves into standard ghost story stuff and loses some of its suspense disappointingly cheesy ending really mars this movie too house on haunted hill suspect has just about left the second run theaters it worth catching on cable next year if you get chance if you have choice pick this movie over the haunting it the better of two evils you could say though more appropriately perhaps it be better to say that it the better of two turkeys
the 44 caliber killer has struck again starring john leguizamo mira sorvino adrian brody jennifer esposito michael rispoli bebe neuwirth rated summer of sam will be remembered as waste of spike lee abilities lee is great filmmaker often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg but here he gets himself into bind his latest effort is case of director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work the summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city it was the hottest summer on record to boot new york first serial killer was on the loose calling himself the son of sam david berkowitz killed people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population so it was understandable that when nyc was hit with citywide blackout people went berserk causing billions of dollars in damage to the city the movie focus is on group of twenty somethings during that fateful summer vinny john leguizamo club hopping adultrous hairdresser his benevolent wife dionna mira sorvino looking young ritchie adrian brody punk who becomes an outcast as well as son of sam suspect gang of small time mobsters and few more minor characters we follow them through their roller coaster lives thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him make him stay faithful to her ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more eccentric and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam first murder looms the night he promises he will strike again local gang with too much time on its hands makes list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects at the top of the list is ritchie vinny an unwilling part of the said group is called upon to set trap for his friend as we watch these proceedings some of which are painfully graphic the dreaded so what question springs to mind from the way this movie is made have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something but as searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find lee touches on so much the media the 70 punk scene the details of the actual killings as well as the characters very personal dilemmas but he doesn bring all of his topics together to form coherent theme or make discernible statement all is not lost if movie turns out to be hollow it can be saving grace for the film to be enjoyable too bad summer of sam doesn get any help here frankly it bore redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn entertain beyond its first half hour there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague leguizamo turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny the script makes it clear that we re supposed to believe that his character is flawed but still good guy you never guess from his performance adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better sorvino gives riveting touching performance in banal movie tempted to think that liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane her character is affecting and her emotions true to heart brody too paints an effective portrait of young guy desperate for attention who gets little more than he bargained for summer of sam has some superficial elements of good film it looks great it has few notable performances and suppose it pretty well directed in purely technical way but it also empty pretentious and boring like last year the thin kirmizi line it movie by director who doesn know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway 1999 eugene novikov&#137

wild things is way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day provided of course that you re the victim of frontal lobotomy there is in fact no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at movie goers in their late teens and early twenties the most lucrative target group this is film noir for the mtv generation fast paced slick flashy gleefully mindless and hollow to the core wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 ve seen more convincing drama with nearly as much bare flesh on that pinnacle of narrative quality baywatch wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it thriller with real story what it is however is series of increasingly improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists everything in between those serpentine moments is filler flash of breast spatter of blood and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of steven seagal movie the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess just take stab at the most unlikely thing to happen and that will probably be it using this approach was right three times and wrong only once that not good average for production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what around the next corner the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie the hot young cast and the old standby sex both have an abundance of screen time although ll admit that the film erotic content is somewhat less impressive than expected nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu the soft core sex sequences are generic and don generate much heat the lesbian kisses can hold candle to those in bound theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances neve campbell possessing an iron clad no nudity clause in her contract keeps her clothes more or less on the film greatest curiosity is full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower maybe few girls will skip seeing fully clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch glimpse of what kyra sedgwick mrs kevin bacon is familiar with the director of wild things is john mcnaughton whose last effort was the finely tuned psychological thriller normal life that movie featured copious sex pair of real characters and powerful script it difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker but suppose we all need to put food on the table mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here in what is obviously stab at mainstream success his previous wide release picture mad dog and glory was box office disappointment quick cuts and pretty sunrises can even begin to cover up this movie flaws the main character and use that term lightly since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality is sam lombardo matt dillon guidance counselor at florida mavi bay high school student the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan denise richards has crush on him one afternoon she comes to his house to wash his car and when she leaves her clothing is torn after confessing to her mother theresa russell that she was raped she goes to the police station where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette kevin bacon and gloria perez daphne rubin vega they are skeptical about here claims until another girl suzie toller neve campbell comes forward with similar tale meanwhile sam convinced that he being set up goes to shyster lawyer bill murray for help the acting in wild things isn very good but none of the principals have much to work with this is definitely not character based motion picture not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have triple digit but it doesn bother to give any of the on screen individuals even hint of depth the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice but nothing more matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps neve campbell gets to model the slutty look denise richards strikes fetching pose in see through one piece bathing suit and nothing in the film gets rise out of kevin bacon the only one who even remotely interesting is bill murray and he seems to think he in comedy not thriller maybe he got the right idea columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film ending which prompts the question which ending do they want kept secret wild things has no less than three one occurs during the end credits so stay seated all of which are jaw droppingly absurd feat that joe eszterhas the writer of basic instinct and showgirls would be impressed by thanks to jeffrey kimball polished kinetic cinematography wild things always looks great and george clinton score keeps it pulsing and throbbing but no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is this is still trash and like all garbage it stinks
dear god this is fantastically bad film regardless of what say about knock off you can grasp its awfulness from my words you have to see it and experience it for yourself here the kicker though suggest that you do so yes this is bad film easily one of the most incompetent films of the year but it has certain misguided charm that makes it unique kind of disaster to endure in fact enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time despite the dreadful acting and completely incomprehensible story don get me wrong not excusing knock off it reaches an unacceptable level of badness it so incoherent that wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon michael wong paul sorvino and of course jean claude van damme it does however have the entertaining presence of rob schneider and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark as watched it occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness now in retrospect it seems clear that it wasn but it still fascinating kind of mess don like writing plot descriptions it is by far the most boring part of writing review but in this case off the hook there is no way could write an accurate synopsis for knock off for the sake of comparison had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing paid closer attention to knock off and the only thing am able to say about it is that van damme plays dude named ray and is accused by the cia think of selling knock off products knock off products are of course products that look like name brand materials but are generic and cheap don know what any of this has to do with martial arts but there are lots of martial arts in the film ray is good at martial arts so when he has to beat up bad guys there no problem rob schneider plays his sidekick although had no idea who he really was by the end of the film lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once in fact every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do in that order knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense but what strange mess it is it was written by stephen de souza who also wrote die hard and 48 hours can this be the same man don see how unless of course huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time knock off seems to have an interesting premise as far as action films go but there no semblance here for instance van damme is introduced and then seconds later he running chariot race through the streets of hong kong why who knows what are the implications of this have no idea most action films abandon depth in favor of action and this is normally problem knock off however is the first film that would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut the acting is embarrassingly bad rochon in particular delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity sorvino in addition deserves better than this van damme is bad but he charming in that bad way and so can say that he hard to watch although rarely understood what he was saying the only exception is rob schneider who is actually quite funny lot of the time tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison they re all pointless gimmicks though such as shots of the inner workings of knock off running shoe but his action scenes are never boring one particular piece inside of fruit factory fruit factory is well choreographed lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy such as our heroes first encounter with the rochon character but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous hope he did for the alternative is frightening thought knock off has the feel of truly terrible exercise in camp mania if it were boring give it zero stars but it not boring it loud and excessive and completely incoherent it also funny even when it isn meaning to be funny bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn deserve to be fully lambasted recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness but can deny it zany useless charm oh know they re just action scenes looking desperately for real story but they re fun action scenes amongst crowd of laughably inane concepts it fun to admire the awfulness of film like this but that doesn excuse the fact that it is indeed awful
there are movies that pose question in its first five minutes and spend the rest of the time trying to answer it then there are movies that spend the whole time posing questions and try to answer it all in the last five minutes writer director john herzfeld two days in the valley falls into the latter category weaving together grabbag of seemingly unrelated characters herzfeld tries very hard to keep the audience guessing with altmanesque series of parallel stories hitmen lee james spader and his partner dosmo danny aiello pop guy in bed while leaving his drugged wife becky fox teri hatcher lying next to him showing the audience where on her behind she got nicely pricked an understandeably shocked becky runs out of the house the next morning before hailing down couple of vice cops jeff daniels and wes eric stoltz murder is not vice territory flirting with asian prostitues is but wes would rather play inquisitive detective meanwhile washed up director teddy paul mazursky is about to end his life but before he can do that he must find good home for his dog enter nurse audrey marsha mason who takes the dog and teddy for ride stuffy art dealer allan hopper greg cruttwell has kidney stones while struggling about his fancy house he switches between moaning in self pity and dropping condescending hints about his loyal secretary glenne headly plain appearance don be surprised if you find yourself asking more than once just what the hell is going on you might like that feeling of cluelessness herzfeld does answer all the questions in the course of time and pieces it all rather neatly in the last five minutes the jigsaw puzzle assembled isn stunning by any means though the characters lack the stature or moral complexity of altman real life heroes in short cuts even though they are interesting and funny funny that is if you aren comparing them to the likes of tarantino pulp chcaracters the tie up is tidy but nowhere near the squeaky clean resolution of director name guy who also did last seduction kirmizi rock west two days isn bad movie but there isn much else to it than the screenplay novelty of the linkage of seemingly unrelated characters it ll keep you guessing alright but you won remember the answers five minutes after the credits the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
my name is jack carter and you don want to know me says our brooding anti hero sylvester stallone take his advice to know this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over terrace and to watch this film is almost as painful get carter is gloomy looking unimaginative film that offers no joy jack carter is as tough as tough guys come he works out of vegas as self described financial adjuster explaining his duties he says people make promises and break them help them remember he has chiseled body full of tattoos he has the weathered look indicative of man who has seen his share of hard times he speaks in hushed but menacing tone of voice in other words this is sylvester stallone acting like sylvester stallone and like most of his previous roles his character is shallow one dimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk tough hassle few hapless people find out what he needs to know and then dispense his own kind of justice with the charisma of pit bull being tough is all that jack carter knows yet even tough guys know when to put family first as the story begins we learn that jack little brother has died in car accident the police attribute it to heavy drinking however jack is suspicious believing that he was taken out he takes break from his vegas duties and tries to see if he can find the truth as he pokes around he runs into several lowlife characters they include shady business partner prostitute dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates and an oily owner of porn website any one of them may know something about his brother death all of them have the means of carrying out the deed but don expect an exercise in sleuthing where well placed clues lead carter to the truth he all brawn and no brains so there are no epiphanies during his investigation instead he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward cycling through this circle of suspects flustered with his lack of progress he cycles through them again and again this all gets tiring fairly quickly by the time the film launches into its final act we re numb from its pedestrian pace oddly as tough guy thriller it starves us for action admittedly there is one nifty chase sequence but this is related to tangential and needless plot carter vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him the story also fails to generate any kind of emotion stallone has the personality of slab of stone and the look and feel of the film is perpetually downcast the weather is constantly overcast or rainy meanwhile most shots take place at night in dimly lit rooms or in dark alleys it just impossible to get stirred about that kind of atmosphere as result get carter amounts to nothing more than flat thriller bereft of clever moments and devoid of any excitement you re better off leaving this guy alone
synopsis man whose lover paris was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system the subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend laura and becomes addicted to virtual reality which due to design flaw in his unit recreates the dead paris comments virtual seduction executive produced by roger corman and lance robbins serves as cheaply made precursor to strange days far superior film both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are ab using technology to be with former lovers in strange days the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality interestingly both films also take place couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium though strange days uses the setting far more effectively this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction it not bad for what it is low budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality unfortunately it been done before and since in much better films fact which ultimately leaves the sci fi fan bored by this movie virtual seduction has many faults one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins the film script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavy handed and wooden as the movie progresses many important scenes seem too dark the lighting could have been improved significantly the cast collection of veteran movie actors and sitcom regulars do only mediocre job in their roles jeff fahey of the original lawnmower man convincingly though unenergetically plays the lead character carrie genzel plays paris the vr lover but ami dolenz as the current love interest seems like much more interesting and attractive character with caring personality which doesn lend credence to the film premise meschach taylor of the once popular designing women sitcom adequately plays scientist working on the project but his performance isn something to write home about either virtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background in other words one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then but it rather boring to just sit and watch the movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from movies in this genre but it is still an adult rated film due to sexual situations and suicide attempt this turkey ultimately isn awful but it not particularly interesting or unique either don be seduced into watching this movie unless you ve got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch
yeah yeah the advertisements didn even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook sex neve campbell and starship trooper denise richards getting it on ok yeah it decent two minutes of film erotica but even if that your main interest in this film there plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes wild things does have lot more to think about than you might expect however nearly every single scene is huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing or at least curious to see the next turn throughout the entire movie but this fast paced razor sharp turning of events doesn leave much time to enjoy the surprises we start off in high class california high school where every student resembles supermodel in the making guidance counselor sam lombardo matt dillon seems to catch the eye of every student particularly kelly van ryan richards daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts right off the bat kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce mr lombardo the fund raiser car wash seems the opportune time particularly when you wash your guidance counselor jeep in all beyaz clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you ll be soaked from head to toe when you re done on the weekend of the car wash kelly attempts at seduction fall flat and when they do she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day naturally sam is thrown into state of panicked shock at these accusations but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to criminal trial when low class marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller campbell comes forth with near identical story also involving her trusted guidance counselor pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney ken bowden played by bill murray yes that bill murray sound like good complete movie yes that alone could have been but this is just the beginning in fact the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time by the time the movie finishes you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable unfortunately with so much going on you re not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when new twist comes about this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could ve been the 113 minutes fly by and although it never feels underdeveloped this pretzel of storytelling could ve been much more richly realized had slower pace been taken the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime time soap operas which no is not good thing and it not just campbell who happens to hail from the prime time fox soap party of five but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones dillon who was so charming in his understated role in last year in out gives the best performance and murray surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film in fact if the whole movie had been promoted as subtle comedy even if it was the exact same film would actually give it better grade that how cheezy it comes off but aside from these two the rest offer nothing more than some good eye full in the right hands wild things could ve been wickedly delightful scrumptiously twisted thriller but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting and what up with these people passing as high school students realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles but when realized it wasn supposed to be college they were at had to snicker won lie this is definitely guilty pleasure as corny as it is it got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least for effort but if you just want to admire denise richards go for last year starship troopers which was every bit as campy but million times better of course if seeing her breasts is your most important goal you ll be right at home with wild things perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters
in the interest of being generous want to start this review with the scene that liked in meet joe siyah sir anthony hopkins playing super rich media mogul has gathered his family around him for dinner his oldest daughter played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes hopkins frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair does what any man in his position would do he punts whichever one you like dear he says and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do she cries liked that scene for two reasons first the cakes looked really cool second it was perhaps the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act meet joe siyah is chock full of odd performances people doing things for no discernible reason at all and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot it easy to watch meet joe siyah for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani but it even easier to sleep right through it two people on my row managed it quite nicely the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess know my audience had problems with the movie because they thought it was comedy case in point everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie however the first we see of him is as young lawyer in coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani it not clear from the movie whether you need law degree to become the angel of death but it makes certain kind of sense it shouldn take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr pitt and indeed they do after hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished well when that happened the audience howled with laughter and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous so if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing room humor are funny encourage you to go see meet joe siyah immediately anyway the deceased lawyer body no worse the wear from its massive injuries is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role the idea is that death given the pen name of joe siyah so as not to disturb others wants to take holiday and experience the world if this weren hollywood we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death but since it is we get scene after scene of fish out of water humor just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn know how to act in our society it also doesn help that the character of death is written so inconsistently he claims to be on vacation but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani just try to get your travel agent to book that one he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois he knows everything about some characters nothing about others and as played by brad pitt he not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing he just there it as if someone told pitt never mind about acting in this picture son just stand there and look pretty it as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie ve used the phrase angel of death in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt performance with this year best angel performance nicolas cage in city of angels where pitt is cold and unfeeling cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man pitt is aloof and arrogant cage struck instant chemical sparks with co star meg ryan where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani character is so shallow that she can see beyond pitt good looks the movie other top name is much better actor but that doesn save meet joe siyah sir anthony hopkins isn given much better material to work with unfortunately he plays one of these good hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins character more realistically evil hopkins is marked for death due to bad ticker but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world of course no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder but have to wonder and in this movie you have very long time to wonder how you or would act in similar situation especially if you or were multimillionaire hopkins pretty much goes to the office and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated sure stayed awake all the way through meet joe siyah and asking myself why movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest which is what going to do now go spend time with your family go volunteer for local charity heck go take nap don go see meet joe siyah because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death curtis edmonds no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it sideshow bob
cop with troubled personal life ruthless villain friend of the cop _dead_ friend of the cop quest for vengeance new partner romantic interest chase scene chase scene _in san francisco_ woman in peril confrontation an explosion the end yawn yawn yawn the preceding has been the plot of approximately twelve thousand and six action films this one just happens to be called metro have learned to expect little from films like metro and consequently am bored by them more often than am genuinely disappointed with eddie murphy on board however you hope for something extra some kind of spark when film makes watching eddie murphy tedious experience you know it is doing something terribly wrong murphy stars as scott roper hostage negotiator for the san francisco police department who is exceedingly good at his job with his personal life he is considerably less successful facing an unhappy ex girlfriend named veronica carmen ejogo gambling problem and mountain of debt then his professional life gets jolt as well when friend and colleague art evans is murdered while investigating suspected jewel thief michael korda michael wincott finding korda becomes very personal to scott and he joins with new partner kevin mccall michael rappaport to foil korda during an attempted heist but all is not well even with korda in jail as scott veronica and kevin all continue to face life threatening danger metro the title in case you are wondering means absolutely nothing is so badly put together that even the most casual viewer may notice the miserable pacing and stray plot threads in the first place korda rage over being discovered before he can make his big score is rendered completely pointless when he proceeds to hit the target anyway and incidentally to screw it up reference to payoffs in the police department followed by conspicuous decision to keep scott off the korda case and couple of pointed glances is dropped abruptly with no resolution after about forty five minutes even the relationship between scott and new partner kevin is so perfunctory with kevin disappearing entirely after taking bullet for scott that you may yearn for bickering buddies worst of all is plot structure which places the main villain the always menacing michael wincott behind bars for far too long leaving lot of time to kill with the tedious reconciliation of scott and veronica you can blame murphy for being unable to muster any enthusiasm for the scenes with his bland leading lady but he should have known better than to take this role at all scott roper exists in an uncomfortable middle ground between the kind of street wise fast talker murphy has built career on and an actual three dimensional character and murphy is never able to reconcile the two the script seems to have been doctored for him with gambling problem turned into bit of character color and his supposed inability to form relationships turned into cause for gags rather than actual conflict yet there is still too little comedy for murphy to work with for much of the film he walks around with an intense frown and it is over 90 minutes into metro before you hear that trademark laugh for the first time murphy is stranded with too few solid punch lines and nearly all of the ones he does have bounce of ejogo and fall to the ground limply suppose should give director thomas carter credit for taking the obligatory san francisco car chase how much do you want to bet on the likelihood of seeing car soar over hill and doing few interesting things with it as vehicles are sent flying and passengers sent sprawling by runaway cable car it is possible at least for moment to take some pleasure in goofy spin on familiar situation carter does an even better job by taking that old suspense stand by the medicine cabinet mirror which will close to reveal killer standing behind someone and using it to defuse tension not once but _twice_ the fact that carter was able to demonstrate even that much recognition of cliches and willingness to subvert them makes his involvement in the rest of the disaster that is metro all the more puzzling an action film like this plods so relentlessly and obviously from point to point to point that you might find yourself shouting out point while they re still getting to point or getting up with the rest of the audience after the big explosion which signals that nothing else of any consequence is going to happen
still can figure out why people went in droves to see this movie now before you go assuming some sort of high brow snob who can appreciate little dumb humor let me say that love cheap humor thought there something about mary was one of the funniest films that have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998 low brow adolescent humor can be lot of fun the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent there is no humor component wanted to like the waterboy really did think only laughed maybe or times throughout the entire movie actually smiled couple of more times on top of that not great record for 90 minute film the problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies those responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is substitute for actual funny material nothing could be further from the truth as matter of fact sandler idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film it really shame too because this film had the potential to be very funny personally believe that sandler is probably very talented comedian it just that so far he hasn been able to find the right film to showcase his talents if his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live most of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry sandler plays 31 year old somewhat mentally challenged waterboy for college football team the team somewhat mentally disturbed coach henry winkler realizes that his waterboy has great deal of pent up rage which if harnessed properly would make him force to be reckoned with on the football field you can figure out the rest from here sandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes football star as said the film had great deal of potential the idea was decent one but the main potential of this movie is result of the cast all of whom are very good just hamstrung by really really lousy material even sandler annoying goofy voice and all has enough charisma and natural comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material even as unfunny as his character is still found myself rooting for him throughout the film but it is the supporting cast that feel most badly about if their material had been just bit better this film could have been such funny movie fairuza balk plays sandler leather wearing biker chick love interest and does great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time winkler is great as the coach who uses coaching for dummies style book to help him get through games the real standout though is kathy bates even with some of the worst material of her career to deal with she is still treat to watch in her role as sandler overprotective and overbearing mama even with the performances of bates and winkler there is absolutely no way would recommend this movie although get the distinct impression that without them this film would have ranked in negative numbers for me which is sad because can really put my finger on particular element of the movie and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became it obvious that those involved specifically the actors tried very hard to make what they thought was going to be funny movie it just too bad that 99 percent of all of the jokes fell flat
gordie boggs arquette aptly cast as moron as he is one and his best friend sean dawkins scott caan the son of james caan should not be reduced to garbage like this are two losers from wyoming with no jobs and no girlfriends who look up to world championship wrestling champion jimmy king terribly casted oliver platt as he is everything they are not they finally get to see him live and he is screwed out of his title by the evil ruthless promoter titus sinclair wasted palitaliano in role originally meant for real life wcw president eric bischoff whose name was written all over the role gordie and sean track down king in atlanta and discover that he is not really the english king the wcw writers created for him but drunken ignorant southerner who is as irritated by these two lunkheads as bob newhart was by larry darryl and darryl they sneak him back onto wcw tv after which sinclair agrees to book him in steel cage match in las vegas at wcw next pay per view against his rival diamond dallas page if he wins king gets his title and his career back plus one million dollars wcw president eric bischoff knowing his promotion was desperate with bad writing and ratings skyrocketing down thanks to the far superior world wrestling federation came up with the idea for this movie hoping it would save wcw he was then fired and rehired two months ago but by the time he left they had already been contracted to do the film and bischoff could not play sinclair which in itself is for the best as anybody who has seen him on wcw programming knows that bischoff is no actor the characters of gordie and sean show you exactly what eric bischoff thinks of his fans he thinks of them as young dumb pathetic idiots who will believe anything that will be put out in front of them is real that is why he doesn take the fans into consideration when he books nitro or pay per view have news for you eric no wrestling fan in this day and age is dumb enough to believe that professional wrestling isn for show unless they are four years old this is 2000 you know not 1985 bischoff will try to cover up criticism like that by saying it is comedy but have no doubt in my mind that if this had been dramatic rocky style film which it probably should have been professional wrestling is ridiculed enough as it is why should the first wrestling movie in ten years be comedy gordie and sean would have been portrayed in the same light anybody who has seen the documentary wrestling with shadows documenting wwf owner vince mcmahon double crossing of bret hart will probably realize via the reviews and previews of ready to rumble that it is basically rip off of that film storyline with the poor man wayne and garth thrown in for comedic affect you can tell titus sinclair is supposed to poke fun at vince but any self respecting wrestling fan knows that sinclair is more inspired by bischoff than vince and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart all of these aspects of the film needless to say seriously offended me as wrestling fan another thing found disturbing about the film was the romance between gordie and nitro girl sasha the lovely rose mcgowan wouldn it have been easier to bring something new into the relationship rather than revealing she was only working on gordie at sinclair insistance hate that cliche the world wrestling federation would have made better film they are the promotion everyone cares about they are winning the ratings they have better wrestlers and they take their fans into consideration and don treat fans like morons so vince how about movie
payback brian helgeland inauspicious directing debut coincidentally he previously penned the award winning screenplay for 1997 confidential is wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea movie with non stop violence death and villains and runs with it or should say barely manages to crawl away with it mel gibson in yet another disappointing picture conspiracy theory and lethal weapon anyone stars as the reprehensible villain hero porter man who becomes determined to get his 50% share of $140 000 which he stole in robbery back when his partner in crime gregg henry and drug addicted wife deborah kara unger double cross him shoot him and leave him for dead porter is not dead however not by long shot as he quickly rehabilitates and along with his loyal prositute girlfriend rosie maria bello sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay the tagline for payback is get ready to root for the bad guy and sure enough this is true as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way wouldn have problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest but it wasn and therefore found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever no attempt is made to flesh the roles into three dimensional characters and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them just because the protagonist bad guy is played by mel gibson doesn mean will root for him and didn quite the contrary every person in the movie deserved to die gory death although some of them did anyway just to spice up the dull proceedings since none of the respectable actors in payback actually have human beings to play only one performance managed to stand out lucy alexis liu of ally mcbeal who plays spicy s&m dominatrix brightens up every scene she is in and has definite flair for comedy something would have liked to have seen more of since most of the humor fell with resounding splat meanwhile gibson who is perfectly fine here sleepwalks through role that is not the least bit challenging unger who made an impression in 1997 the game is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such part since she disappears ten minutes in and only has two purproses to get high on heroin and because she plays key part in an early flashback finally kris kristofferson appears in throwaway role during the climax and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like sore thumb tellingly he didn appear in the original cut of the film but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later like most action movies the star often takes licking but keeps on ticking in the course of the 102 minute running time of payback porter is shot three times in the back hit by van beaten up and has his feet smashed with sledgehammer and guess what not only does he survive the whole ordeal but he is happy go lucky in the penultimate sequence and can still walk even though he looks like he had recently substituted for punching bag payback is not in any way an entertaining film even though am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is blank screen perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this so he could have at least added few worthwhile elements like fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for few hours
plot something about bunch of kids going into haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and non horror movies oh yeah there also something about ghost possessing the mansion and shit but trust me you won care much about the plot in this film critique parody movies either work or they don and this one just doesn work the laughs aren as pronounced this time around the energy level the gags and all of the characters just seem to be going through the motions here it like they were all in hurry to finish the film or something wink wink and the scariest part of it all check out the number of screenwriters it took to pen this puppy seven say again it took seven people to write 82 minutes worth of fart jokes half assed stunts and spoofs of films other than horror now not exactly sure if each of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed funny sketch ideas out there while smoking the chronic themselves but the end result is film that basically plays out like an extended skit on saturday night live there are couple of funny one liners but mostly just rehashed one joke scenes lot of dead silence and lame gags add to that the very unoriginal title and movie poster and you gotta start asking yourself if anybody was even trying here the film website isn even up yet what the do however have to give it up to james woods the man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody of them all the exorcist take off miss this and you ve missed any reason to see the flick especially liked his one liner as he walked in to see the possessed woman head turning very funny unfortunately the film plummets straight down after that with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do with horror such as save the last dance and dude where my car and other action movies like charlie angels and mission impossible now help me figure this one out will you isn this supposed to be parody film of horror movies or maybe that just the title of the film ing with my head well sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this film is its lame ass script the wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers money instead of the zucker brothers comedy for this sequel unfortunately for us all we re left with here is skeleton of film which might ve been funny had it been worked over few more times tightened up here and there and been injected with more solid laughs but as things stand now there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last year film has led everyone down this path so screw them for not trying as hard critically speaking of course you should all be ashamed of yourselves for not putting enough real effort into this chop job and for not providing your fans with the ultimate of your talents pooh on you that telling em joblo sheesh btw allotting one point alone to actress kathleen robertson whose massive breasts and skanky string had me chompin at the bit you go girl everyone else stay where joblo coming from airplane 10 10 airplane ii 10 10 galaxy quest 10 hannibal 10 the haunting 10 mafia 10 naked gun 10 scary movie 10 top secret 10
warning the following review contains spoilers cast gary sinise don cheadle connie nielsen jerry connell kim delaney tim robbins elise neal jill teed jody thompson bill timoney written by jim thomas john thomas and graham yost directed by brian depalma running time 115 minutes the first big event movie of 2000 turns out to be anything but gary sinise stars as an astronaut who is removed from mars mission when his astronaut wife maggie kim delaney becomes ill and passes away don cheadle is then given the mission along with russian couple and young hotshot when strange whirlwind shot from the top of mars mountain range attacks the crew of the mission sinise and robbins convince their superior to let them neilsen and connell perform rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaining what they discover on the surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected before ever saw the film was aware of the promotional campaign with dr pepper every time would see bottle of the soft drink the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it little did know that the plot would be taking back seat to the product placement of the drink and several other products dr pepper saves the day at one point and dream sequence flashback features jerry connell shoving m&m in our face these are but couple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film clich are also the order of the day with mission to mars dialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style even independence day which lifted all of it premises from other sci fi films was better than this film and don like independence day films like 2001 space odyssey the abyss and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from and poorly at that there is even sequence where rover is traveling through canyon and couldn help but whisper tinni to myself and wait for jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get glimpse of it this film also features one of my all time least favorite movie clich the he would have wanted you to have this moment where one character gives another trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on scenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films but in film as clich ridden as this it is particularly irritating ennio morricone music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on but here it is dreadfully overbearing his music sounds like it came straight out of vincent price movie in certain scenes at other times his music is unbearably over dramatic one sequence involving daring spacewalk rescue is given particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won reach its intended target mission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme events are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience we are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife but felt extreme boredom coupled with twinge of disinterest what makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins character needs to turn himself into popsicle except to invoke an emotional response could think of at least one way to save him and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be smarter than am during the finale when we are finally introduced to the translucent conehead kitty faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn brief history lesson about where we came from is proffered then sinise is whisked away to be with the rest of our people he does this because his late wife proclaims in video he watches early on that this is chance to step foot where no one else has >from the press ve been seeing this film receive it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying quick death at the theater sure the first weekend or two will be huge but once word gets out people will stop going let just hope the upcoming kirmizi planet is better than this and isn hurt by the negativity this film is generating venture to say it won be worse than this waste of time [pg]
when critics attack seemingly well intentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as am about to do their opinions are often greeted with backlash of angry mails sometimes even mock death threats from those who suppose like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment even politicians tend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on good hearted films while praising filth like pulp fiction these [fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with] tend to forget that film critic job is to review the movie not the message however sweet and endearing that message may be thusly patch adams isn bad film because it about doctor who cares for his patients it bad film because it calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation similarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place though even doubt that stay tuned an explanation is forthcoming it still an unpleasantly maudlin mess the picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey with burn scared face and equally singed attitude who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world 12 year old trevor haley joel osmet disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother helen hunt comes up with the notion to pay it forward this entails person doing one good deed call it an uber favor for three others then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we re all living in frank capra movie meanwhile in parallel story weasely reporter jay mohr tracks the movement which has apparently begun to grow pay it forward has odd ideas about tone at certain points it hurls smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core it as if director mimi leder didn have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended and compromised out of fear that her film wasn gutsy enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for so the picture adds grit child molester propositions trevor homeless man returns to heroin after being saved character is knifed while doing good deed etc though it seems shallow incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn quite sure if it ready to buy into its own utopian blather pay it forward offers crowd pleasing elements for general audiences jay mohr umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball angie dickinson earthy alcoholic bag woman and the jive talking siyah hoodlum with heart of altin coming on the heals of the siyah god like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled this may just be the beginnings of brand new guilty beyaz liberal clich hurray for hollywood who actually calls the mohr character nigga and says things like can you feel me leave it to pay it forward to happily include little minstrel act for our further enjoyment maybe spike flick wasn so misguided after all these scenes feel as if they belong in dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you ll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings while the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is film that could make the world better place to me the final product has the oily feel of cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to hopeful audience it picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration with the main players all previous oscar winners or nominees given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns one scene in which slightly de glamed helen hunt de glamed here means that not only is she fashion victim [her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama] hunt hair is also natty and badly bleached verbally castigates spacey feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip spacey of course responds in his cultured monotone that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance maybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating though how can he not even when he emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by wry indifference the usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender in one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke and with said hand still on said mouth she actually begins convulsing dry heaving really then and not making this up she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in frenzied search for alcohol the scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as parody of hackneyed tv movie blow ups it all very theatrical especially hunt performance which feels like pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar pay it forward has the dubious distinction of being film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn get academy awards the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists even haley joel osemt the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections his acting has become broader less intimate it as if we can make out the little munchkin thoughts boy this outta floor em naturally osmet is made to play one of those only in the movies children martyr figure who cleans up after his mother lectures her on the ills of drinking and even fixes her up on date with his intellectual teacher never mind that the two couldn be more dissimilar his mother is trailer trash dopey and the teacher is one of those dennis miller ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind vast vocabulary nevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in scene that recalls parent trap ish cornball antics but oh how we love bright articulate self sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life they re so adorable of course the blame can all be hoisted onto the actors though with the exception of the little kid they probably should have known better instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er then went on to make two awful genre films in row the first being the peacemaker witless post cold war george clooney vehicle and deep impact one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth possible demise by crazed meteorite the first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich and complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of ticking time bomb complete with digital read out apparently present for an invisible audience deep impact has more in common with pay it forward it movie that treats earth impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be goner within days the film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching in pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like rebuttal see my movie isn as na ve as you might think she seems to be saying no it just horribly confused
think we should as responsible citizens all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie he changing the cinema as we know it and for the worst would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments prologues epilogues etc the premise lawyer can lie for day ho ho normally movie made from this premise would be terrible mr carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable laughed once and was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing grinding doesn begin to describe it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that if you are normal person you leave feeling sick when it not trying to be funny it trying to be melodramatic but it just annoying stupid and sappy at best this movie is intended to make people laugh yes not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound but it fails on every possible level it fails to be funny it fails to be insightful it fails to be suspensful it fails to be fun they should pay people to see it it suceeds on one level it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles for having lived if you go in with the intention of coming out alive please make sure that you are overly fond of boob fart pimple and fat jokes otherwise you will go insane yes literally insane stark raving mad it is boring stupid melodramatic and in the end ugly reccemond it strongly to ed wood
you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year they re obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big box office holiday season combine that with howie long first starring action role and you ve got doozy of movie that while not as bad as it could have been isn very good film howie stars as an ace smokejumper firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground in the slightly contrived opening scenes we witness his heroism in action as he and his mentor played by scott glenn attempt to rescue small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire william forsythe plays the bad guy mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak he and five convict cohorts manages to get selected for firefighting duty when woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby his escape plan bets lot on the laxity of the guards but since there must be movie luck is with him soon the now escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters why canadian who knows eh along the way they pick up pretty birdwatcher suzy amis to be their hostage enter howie long he called in to help fight the blaze and when he spots the group of ground pounders apparently lost he parachutes in to help when he discovers their true identity he is the only thing standing between them and escape and the only hope of help for the hostage long acting talents are above those of say steven seagal but not by much although his delivery is mostly flat and wooden he likeable hero and there are some hints here and there that he may get better the script doesn help him out any however all too often it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny the dialogue is strictly movie material and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable long co stars are mixed bag at least they re all comfortable in their respective roles forsythe has the scenery chewing villain down cold down cold and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch even when he doesn seem to be stretching his talents as is definitely the case here suzy amis plays peril pretty well but isn given much more to do some of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting but many are rather bland you think that the director dean semler former cinematographer would at least produce film with interesting visuals that not the case there lack of originality to nearly all the sequences we ve seen this stuff before it not the most auspicious start to 1998 but it could have been worse just think back to 1996 debut bio dome however after month of oscar caliber pictures movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were in fact there good chance that some of them are still playing near you
this film is extraordinarily horrendous and not going to waste any more words on it
well lets see not quite sure how to review this film based on its laughter factor well yeah can it not funny ok so laughed one time which warranted the star but other than that sat in my seat wondering when this pos would be over which at running time of 107 minutes seemed like forever in fact this could be the un funniest movie ve seen in long time if not the un funniest let me be the first to say ready to rumble is huge disappointment long time wrestling lovers david and scott dream of making it to the wcw and watching jimmy king wrestle that is their hero of course whom is kicked out of the wcw well here is where the plot thickens lol the two wish to rescue the king and put him back into the wcw but not that easily because they are being tampered with by many people who are out to get them while david father wants him to become police officer and scott is loser who has to with the help of david clean out johnny on the spots what plot eh ready to rumble is one of those films that tries to be funny but sadly fails miserably everything in the film is imcomprehinsable and even the trailer wasn funny the actors are dull the script awful and the plot which there isn much of really annoying not quite sure how great actors like these and very funny actors too are given such lame script and directed in such childish manner that wonder if hollywood is ever gonna make good films these days this review isn going to be very long because of the fact that there isn much going for the film if anything at all only one big laugh is in the film which isn all that hilarious sat in my chair wondering with this 107 minute comedy was going to be over and sadly it went on forever not sure if anything could have saved this film from being such total waste but believe me you it is reviewed by brandon herring 29 00 for more reviews please visit movie review central at http www geocities com moviefan983 moviereviewcentral html
14 years ago national lampoon introduced us to new family the griswolds in 1983 the griswolds embarked on cross country journey with the destination of wally world world renowned theme park in california we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured two years later we watched again as they went to europe and four years after that we shared christmas with them now eight more years have passed and the laughs have done more than die they ve been cremated vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold the good intentioned but ill fated father of two the premise is basically the same clark has wonderful idea to take his family on bonding vacation this time to las vegas his wife ellen beverly angelo and teenage kids rusty and audrey always played by different actors this time around by ethan embry and marisol nichols respectively join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick of course vacation movie wouldn be complete without good ole eddie reprised by randy quaid the misfit cousin showing up at all the wrong times there isn too much of plot here when it comes right down to it it really just skit movie there are couple of ways to define skit movie which is not real term as far as know the first would be movie that basically has one running gag for two hours therefore coming off like two hour skit the second would be movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits each lasting about five minutes vegas vacation comes off like the first good example of the latter would be last year siyah sheep the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast and it doesn really fit into movie mold in these cases plot which is generally very thin is used either as shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags have good vegas joke make vegas movie such is the case with this movie mini plots clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold money ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton rusty has fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie shae lyn as an exotic dancer the simple fact is this movie isn funny at first did find myself chuckling heartily at couple of little jokes but when the movie got rolling my interest suddenly stopped chase plays clark griswold really well he made the character and he is the character angelo to be quite honest never was too impressive as ellen and this movie doesn show any signs of redemption as for the two new griswold kids the word blah comes to mind the vacation series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters the simple reason being that there is nothing to them they re so generic you ll expect the credits to read girl #1 as audrey griswold vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor yes it true that vegas vacation isn even close to being close to being as funny as the others which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways but there are couple of other things that set this one negatively apart first off why did they leave off the national lampoon heading on the title couldn find any reasons why but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn want to be associated with such lame film that saying lot especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented loaded weapon pcu etc if they expected this to be another hit you would assume they be proud to tack on the notorious header but for reasons only we can guess at like the movie sucking they didn there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact the first three films in the vacation series were written by john hughes talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80 including mr mom sixteen candles the breakfast club weird science pretty in pink ferris bueller day off planes trains and automobiles and uncle buck wowzers what sum looking at the names you think this guy wrote everything that now stands as movie icon for the 1980 well that not all this guy also brought us 90 hits including the home alone series the remake of 101 dalmatians dennis the menace and the current flubber vegas vacation however didn have john hughes behind it and the loss is very obvious this time around the script is in the hands of elisa bell whose only credits thus far include four made for tv movies vegas vacation plays very much like one and it would actually work much better as made for tv sequel if this sounds like wild idea it not revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies and they seemed like it vegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as 00 sunday morning movie but as silver screen major motion picture it quite out of place stephen kessler jejune direction doesn help things either he only makes the film even more tv movie ish each consecutive vacation movie has suffered drop in directing power we started the series off with harold ramis who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co writing ghostbusters not too bad then we had national lampoon european vacation being directed by amy heckerling who would go on to direct the hits look who talking and clueless as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high lastly we had national lampoon christmas vacation directed by jeremiah chechik who went on to direct the charming benny joon kessler so far has one title under his belt the short film birch street gym which received an oscar nomination in 1992 granted that this was his first attempt at feature length film we can allow for some amateurish quality but instead we get movie straight from the text book boring bland and deeply unoriginal if you loved the vacation movies and know some of us did there still isn anything here worth seeing if you loved them don ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte if you never did like the series why the need to confirm why
the following review contains some harsh language but what did you expect when you clicked on this title cast kristen holly smith danica sheridan alex boling michael dotson sonya hensley janet krajeski sabrina lu dionysius burbano calvin grant jeff harmon written and directed by jeff harmon running time 97 minutes the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside blatz balinski danica sheridan laments the fact that her lesbian lover april kristen holly smith has just received telegram from her ex fiance isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot smith resident of the small town of bumfuck arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson michael dotson when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home sticks gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger instead of killing herself she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed except for lance the homosexual toilet cleaner slave april loves her new home and friends but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up mr and ms pfferpot director jeff harmon and janet krajeski decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr sigmoid colon also jeff harmon who claims he can cure homosexuality in actuality dr colon is homosexual as well and begins his special treatment on dick dickson unbeknownst to dick when april turns down dick demand for her to return to bumfuck he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo style instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance alex boling and the two of them along with april and her lover blatz get married note to the filmmaker why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided april parents feeling like there is no recourse call in favor to president clinton and send nuclear bomb whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of homosexual performer their way the bomb is dud thanks to the work of the circuitry and they re wire it and send it back to washington destroying it mr and ms pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own not sure if writer director co star jeff harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs either way he manages to present some of the most offensive material have ever seen in movie the film opens with preacher running small african american child out of town and then later moves on to the hanging of michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan during jaunty musical number preceded by remarks about gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others such as the jews if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be then apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film but it is presented so mean spiritedly that can help but feel like he had some serious intent as for the entire central theme of the movie afraid that it one that just don get tried to keep an open mind while watching it but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non acceptance not prone to judging anyone and believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society but don force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me again maybe missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make but if so think it could have been handled little more tactfully as far as musical comedies go isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical but good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy despite the disturbing visuals mom and apple pie stuck with me for the rest of the day speaking of disturbing visuals wedding bells ain ringing could have been decent song but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying lesbian which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular is also pretty good but good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms smith it mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based the other performers are decent save for the rosie donnell like performance given by danica sheridan have no inherent problem with her character it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired one particular musical number lesbian rock was one of the lowest points have ever experienced in my film going life thanks to strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll the remainder of the running time is padded out with few more songs lesbian rock included and the ridiculously presented anti nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it feature length film once the isle of lesbos reprise was reached felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www indie underground com the transfer is pretty clean and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent and the film is letterboxed at approximately 85 in many respects isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential like rocky horror for the new millennium this film is by no means my cup of tea but know there are those out there who will enjoy it if you think it might be for you then by all means seek it out on the other hand will be cleansing my palette with good action film like gladiator wait aren gladiator films considered to be oh never mind
there no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based as its opening credits proclaim on true story but if it an accurate picture of life on america mean streets than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had much stronger basis in reality than would have previously thought for from the film outset when group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles not unlike number of movie lowlifes who recently gave madonna song close reading donnie brasco resembles more than passingly few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction our eponymous hero johnny depp is not the cheap crook he first appears to be brasco is joseph pistone an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming up to lefty al pacino seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being wiseguy regrettably pistone learns his lessons all too well his concern for lefty who is burdened with heroin addicted son exacerbates his own family troubles his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband gangster persona is becoming little too convincing true the focus on pistone family life does deviate from the typical gangster flick formula but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn out domestic squabbles including an ill advised marriage guidance routine that slow the film down unnecessarily the biggest problem with donnie brasco however is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70 but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style loved those fluoro coloured suits of scorces costume drama casino more importantly pacino presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively donnie brasco take on american values for instance is feeble and obvious lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music inexplicably lefty horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us it doesn any more than his family troubles do which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone just think minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface in these pictures pacino dedication to peculiar and bloody hyper capitalism was twisted and confronting while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations donnie brasco tawdry little crime therefore isn so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes but the shameless way in which it sanitises them oh and by the way forgot to mention that the script also sports startling subplot pipstone superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination is that damn you mcbain hear from springfield way so the movie is cliched big deal what do you expect from gangster flick well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be decent example of the genre donnie brasco fails on both counts the action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp woeful performance tends to smother the good work of his comrades admittedly pacino does nothing new and michael madsen sonny simply smirks his way through the picture like slightly subdued mr beyaz but both possess an unmistakable sly charm depp usually exhibits bit of class himself but regrettably being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star struck for he is completely hell bent on mimicking pacino well earned high style the consequences are painful to watch its no exaggeration to say that the film credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family uncanny ability to keep straight face in front of their breadwinner phony brooklyn accent perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco maybe scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks if this is indeed the case surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america underworld is committed to emulating albeit in heavily attenuated form their movie namesakes depp could have poignantly played simple cop who becomes hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big screen gangster greats who knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen but then again perhaps donnie brasco isn so true after all
one of my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric you better watch out for the skin deep like to extend the same warning watch out for skin deep but whatever you do don watch skin deep skin deep is tedious and uneven comedy written and directed by blake edwards john ritter stars as zach dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with big time drinking problem never saw edwards comedy the man who loved women but have to wonder whether skin deep is remake you see to put it mildly zach goes to bed with just about each and every woman he meets as the movie opens zach wife alex catches him with not only his mistress but also his mistress hairdresser like any sensible wife alex kicks zach out of the house and divorces him in response zach goes on spiritual journey of drinking womanizing psychotherapy and self discovery if you re turned on by the idea of watching ritter drink get arrested have sex drink crash his mercedes have more sex drink get arrested again drink and sing horrendously at the piano then skin deep should be right up your alley skin deep makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable and unsympathetic characters zach is rich 80s version of ritter jack tripper character from three company like jack zach is clumsy and inept he the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye zach is supposed to be charming and charismatic but failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him consequently never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis in fact when zach crashes his ex wife wedding in desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony to add insult to injury edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing but stereotypes with which to work for instance vincent gardenia talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender of all the women in the film and there are many alyson reed alone stands out as zach wife reed brings intelligence and sensitivity to the role because we don care the slightest bit about anyone in skin deep the film few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail the comedy in skin deep doesn fare much better most of the jokes are dumb predictable and sitcomish about every ten minutes however edwards does manage to come up with good line or novel sight gag the most effective of which involves pair of dueling condoms overall the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat my final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol and alcoholism zach excessive drinking is clearly ruining his life but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain zach drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences if he crashes his mercedes he gets new one if he gets arrested his lawyer bails him out of jail if his wife leaves him she will eventually decide to give him second chance if he ll clean up his act the tone in skin deep is all wrong edwards treats very serious issue far too lightly making joke out of problem that is no joking matter perhaps edwards should have studied dudley moore in arthur or better yet michael keaton in clean and sober before making skin deep
kate jennifer aniston is having some problems it appears the twenty eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired she learns that her problems are related as the owner of her advertising agency mr mercer kevin dunn explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company taking clients with her solution presents itself in nick jay mohr wedding videographer who kate meets through coincidence and gets photographed with kate boss darcy illeana douglas uses the photograph to fabricate wedding engagement between kate and nick kate is at first repulsed by the idea but after getting immediate positive results she pursues it her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc at dinner with kate bosses he will provoke fight and they will break up she meets nick to propose the plan he accepts kate new status brings unexpected results in other areas the office bad boy sam kevin bacon who wouldn give kate the time of day now does now that she is engaged he pursues an affair with her as doing so would destroy her good girl image hence sam sudden interest things start to fall apart for kate as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her and does not wish to break up with her after some provoking nick does oblige but problems continue for kate it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available or maybe kate does like nick but reconciliation will force her to admit her lies to her employer adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother olympia dukakis who wants her to get married and settle down there is scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is from the waist up only wearing bra it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer it like the director said well we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren that great so what the heck let show jennifer assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating quite frankly it insulting don think aniston is competent enough actress to carry movie she did decent enough job in ed burns she the one because it was smaller and supporting role and she just doesn deliver the goods effectively in this movie her performance was not convincing unfortunately as far as romantic comedies go this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies the film is similar to my best friends wedding in sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions gets no sympathy from me when things go awry didn care for how quickly kate puts down nick profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn glamorous enough for her co workers at least my best friends wedding changed the formula bit and had somewhat surprise ending no such luck with picture perfect every plot occurrence can be spotted mile away including couple that really made no sense after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first let alone consider relationship was quitting her job prerequisite to making amends with nick throw in the fact that don think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of decision believe that kate liked him but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away doubt it and what of the ending scene at wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers well guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars then that would make sense picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron kate jennifer aniston nick jay mohr sam kevin bacon mercer kevin dunn darcy illeana douglas rita olympia dukakis written by randy turgeon february 26 1998 visit my movie reviews www xtdl com ~canran
as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment hollywood doesn loose the oppertunity to get involved by telling stories and expressing opinions this film centers on relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels hays hodges tommy lee jones and terry childers samuel jackson they fought side by side in vietnam where childers saved hodges life by shooting an unarmed pow that against the rules of war but understandable in this story anyway under the specific circumstances certainly hodges is not complaining years pass hodges whose wounds make him unfit for action gets law degree and becomes marine lawyer childers is now respected and much decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould because of his excellent record childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ben kingsley cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops childers does what he has to do evacuate the family and protect the men under his command after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd more than 80 yemeni men women and children are mowed down childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on crowd and murder of unarmed civilians he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film did childers violate authorized military rules of engagement or are there simply no rules in war the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions the murder of 83 innocent civilians has to result into something greater than simple trial in the where is the accusations from the arab leaders where is the the film ends without even telling the most interesting story what happens on the international arena this film in way akin to films such as few good men has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism these accusations are pretty heavy but also unfair what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking one of the earliest apparent problems with rules of engagement is its lack of credibility the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now but is overdone contrived and unrealistic as if chain of events had to happen in particular manner in order for the plot to proceed lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality that is precisely why it not offensive it is completely unobjective many stories are started and never finished many questions are asked but never answered lot of parallels are referring to nothing it seems that neither the director producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film is it about arab mentality america foreign policies america role in the world corruption in the higher circles it goes on and on it consists of countless stories but not definable plot it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one think that it is ironic because director william friedkin probably most acclaimed film was the exorcist which had silly story but became rather effective film in this case you have strong story with many possibilities and the result is silly film though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism such as the impressive battle scenes his latest film does simply not engage believe that friedklin is director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed it obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore catastrophe the characters feel designed unreal merely shadows with no life outside the conflict even the actors can not save this film from going under though both jackson and jones act admirably with performances that are as good as you get with script like this it is not something that these great actors can boast of they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back jackson is gray and jones uninteresting the rest of the cast including ben kingsly blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks the time has come for the verdict on the charges of complete lack of objectivity find this film guilty on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking find it guilty but on the charges of racism find this film not guilty because of it inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere not only when concerning the arab population must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went bit too far portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad guys this is very sad since in time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth however it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states and that it not coincidence that residents in the middle east including yemen are on constant maximum alert
around the end of 1998 japanese cartoon came to the usa television and really wasn that big in fact not many people even knew what pokemon was but in 1999 it hit big with kids and adults alike and became one of the biggest franchises and merchandise seller of all time in fact it even spawned big screen adventure pokemon the first movie which for what it was wasn all that bad it grossed $31 million in its opening weekend and went on to make almost $90 million fans thought it was great and now is second movie in the pokemon craze pokemon the movie 2000 which is far inferior to the original animated movie first up is the plot which there really isn much of in fact the plot what there is bad guy trying to destroy the ancient never before seen pokemon lugia is about it except the fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever well there you go of course ash is followed by his friends misty brock gary and his pokemon friends pikachu squirtle charizard the usual even though the first movie wasn great film it was definately an enjoyable well made movie with an actual thin storyline this new movie however is nothing but garbage there is nothing good to it storywise and its only good thing comes from some plush animation and colors compared to the first film this movie is awfully bland from its opening titles to the end titles it tries its best to work but fails miserably at every corner the characters are dimensional the story thin as chicken broth and the writing very lame even the so called action scenes are extremely lame and falls before it even gets chance to go the voices even aren that good and almost feels like the stars don want to be there like they can tell that this is an extremel bad movie which it certainly is the film has one thing going for it and that is the animation although not up to disney standards it is still very good with some interesting cgi and very colorful animation the colors jump out at you very fast and seem very nicely put on film why film this bad got such good treatment with its animation is still question to be answered hopefully pokemon next year will be much better than this trash for now watch the first one its much much better
perhaps if the impostors didn have so much going for it it wouldn have been such tremendous disappointment written directed and produced by one of its two stars stanley tucci whose last picture was the indie smash hit big night the impostors almost never catches fire sputtering like two day old campfire the story plays like an ad lib sketch that was never polished or completed the film other star oliver platt was hilarious as the senator aide in bulworth the bloated supporting cast is veritable cornucopia of acting talent including woody allen steve buscemi hope davis alfred molina campbell scott lili taylor and tony shalhoub all are wasted save allen who plays theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes the audience will easily identify with allen sentiments with the exception of single original joke involving mirror imaged subtitles the movie engenders little genuine laughter the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it the plot for the movie involves two starving actors maurice oliver platt and arthur stanley tucci who accidentally end up on cruise ship in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor alfred molina who is chasing them they dress up as ship stewards the over the top script has the subtlety of sledgehammer when the leads hide from their pursuers arthur covers maurice mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze at other times we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else while darting in and out of staterooms with the film chapters introduced like placards at vaudeville stage it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what good time all of the actors were having too bad they weren more concerned with the audience potential enjoyment the jokes frequently framed in silence fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film dailies surely if they had they would have realized what leaden results they were producing it is tricky having good actors play bad ones but if they couldn pull it off they should have just given up the show is over for this fella steve buscemi character says towards the end the mystery is why they didn all give up in the beginning there must have been better script somewhere for such wonderful cast the impostors runs 42 it is rated for little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up
suicide is pointless everyone should know that so what this movie like you guessed it pointless the virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide it sets in motion series of events that will change the lives of many people forever that what the press materials for the film probably say now here what say the virgin suicides is huge waste of time boring arty pretentious junk that is about as entertaining as well as committing suicide the movie lost me early on immediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window the girl father james woods holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on then as the scene ends the lawn sprinklers come on is that joke is that supposed to be amusing in some way from then on the movie failed to draw me back in performances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides woods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well dunst has the potential to be big star if she chooses her projects well and while this film is awful she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed there are also few cameos in the film here and there which only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more as result they all seem rather pointless although there brief role given to michael pare from eddie and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since well since eddie and the cruisers perhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the main characters we never get any significant insight into the girls and why they might be feeling what they re feeling all we really know is that mrs lisbon kathleen turner is strict and keeps them on short leash what mother doesn it certainly no reason to commit suicide with the godfather part iii sofia coppola proved that she had no business being in front of the camera with the virgin suicides she proves she has no business behind it either having family connections doesn entitle you to be allowed to make movies so attention film directors stop letting your daughters pout their way into the industry just because they share your dna doesn mean they share your talent [r]
the working title for no looking back was long time nothing new and rarely has there been more apt name for motion picture even though this movie clocks in at relatively skinny 96 minutes it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics writer director edward burns has trotted out hackneyed storyline the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn spent their life in seclusion instead of tweaking the formula little to invigorate the proceedings burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful the most appropriate ending would have been triple suicide and the sooner the better alas that not the case and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio and to further depress audiences burns has shot the entire film on cold rainy days in gray new york state beach town peeks of sunshine are few and far between no wonder the characters are all so miserable first of all we have charlie burns generation slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home that girlfriend is claudia lauren holly and after picking up the pieces of her life following charlie departure she has moved on shacking up with one of charlie old school buddies mike jon bon jovi the two have comfortable relationship but it apparent to even blind person that they re not right for each other claudia years for some spice in her life mike wants to settle down and have children then charlie re enters the mix so who if anyone will claudia end up with who cares no looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that we re not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle so what if no one finds happiness these characters don deserve it anyway especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time they aren real people they re writer construct stumbling through too obvious storyline they should know the ending as well as we do and burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with plot that at least offered surprise or two another frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with group of potentially interesting supporting characters blythe danner is solid as claudia housebound mother connie britton is suitably high strung as claudia neurotic sister and jennifer esposito is eye catching as bartender in search of little romance sadly all we get is quick glimpses into their lives although movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell none of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes edward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here jon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from singer branching into different career but he could still use little polish the worst case is lauren holly who presents completely bland claudia as portrayed here she hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even moment interest not to mention undying love burns ex the monumentally untalented maxine bahns would have been hard pressed to do less inspired job when he released the brothers mcmullen edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the 1995 sundance film festival robert redford has apparently stuck with him the aging actor director executive produced this mess two films and three short years later the luster has faded some movie makers have only one good film in them with back to back duds like she the one and no looking back to follow the delightful brothers burns is beginning to look like member of that undistinguished club
the job of the film critic is to see movie and write review of it that tells you what it about and why it good or bad feel kind of embarrassed to admit this but after having seen get carter really can tell you what it about although could go on and on about how and why it bad movie get carter falls into that category of movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of hollywood executive board room you might call them the steven seagal mickey rourke jean claude van damme wesley snipes school of mediocre action crime thrillers you know the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights shoot outs and car chases but really light on plot and character development they have stories where the so called hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight chase or shoot at sylvester stallone stars as jack carter las vegas based mob enforcer who returns home for his brother funeral he believes his brother richie was taken out and didn die from dwi accident carter one of the most cliche bad asses ever captured on celluloid his face alone is pretty intimidating and there quite few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his rambo on testosterone therapy voice stallone performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesn realize he mocking himself the actual story involves carter investigation into his brother richie death he in town that not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well mickey rourke co stars as one of these characters sort of crime boss who has something to do with running porno web site and blackmailing young internet tycoon played by alan cummings looking and acting lot like pee wee herman there also another plot involving richie mistress secret cd rom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carter still living relatives rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in way that could be remotely comprehendible could just rip the screenplay to shreds plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all don like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally yes get carter is just that complicated and complex and what worse is that it not this intricate to make it seem smart like the usual suspects for example just the opposite you get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably didn remember what had already happened and didn figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax all you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another asking them what they know getting information and then realizing that if he wasn complete idiot he could have figured it out in the first five minutes although the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another making movie entirely about criminals doesn necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters mel gibson starred in payback few years ago that had story not unlike this one but had such good screenplay you couldn help but like him even though he was just as bad guy as jack carter so ultimately get carter fails for pretty much every selling point it has carter is not likable character and you really don care if he gets revenge or not the action sequences are not at all exciting or original the enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all mon you know who going to win every brawl and shoot out and car chase in the end you don feel nearly satisfied with the results the filmmakers did good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible the city is never mentioned by name but assume it seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and it always raining
ve got to admit it huge jim carrey fan loved the first ace ventura as well as the mask and dumb and dumber and even in batman forever which was pretty awful movie carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good until saw ace ventura had no idea how people could find the guy annoying sadly ace ventura shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie but this time it is no longer funny it is just rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save raccoon in reasonable cliffhanger spoof soon he is called out of retirement to find bat which was kidnapped and if not returned in four days will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other once again it up to ace to save the day using his uncanny detective skills those who have been disappointed by carrey more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him over acting to the best of his ability but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesn capture the feel of the original the original benefited from what looked to be carrey constant hyped up improv sequences which were hysterically funny here however the tighter script which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies takes the improvised material from the first and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie giving carrey little chance to improvise instead his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly but one of the biggest problems had was with the character of ventura himself in the first movie he was always cool and one step ahead of every one else perfect for carrey off the wall approach but here ventura is made to look lot stupider and is often made out as the straight guy role which is definitely not carrey style there are definitely some very funny moments but they are few and far between they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura or even dumb and dumber
every now and then reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact either good or bad that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings but sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review the impression left by the film wasn overwhelming on the contrary there were hardly any impression at all since had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it which surprise me to this day because the movie theatre was full was close to sound speakers the show wasn late and didn lack sleep before the show such things happen very rarely to me and after many years the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters old peter brackett nick nolte and young aspiring sabrina peterson julia roberts two of them are assigned to cover the train collision as soon as they meet they start scooping each other but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk and also the romantic feelings they have for each other the plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison tre romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn movie author director and screenwriter charles shyer who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride tries again this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts however although there is some chemistry between the two soon it stops to arouse any interest it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix that collides light hearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers shyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two and fails in both areas making the story cliched and predictable the end result is rather forgettable effort which convinced me not to watch movie again ll give it the benefit of the doubt though
gregg araki the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made so why did see his latest teen bisexual angst opus first of all some of the reviews were fairly positive also the cast consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars including christopher knight eve plumb shannen doherty and david leisure was promising last of all wanted to give arraki one more chance mean the guy can be that untalented can he the answer to that question is three letters long nowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles since arraki doesn know how to make anything coherent it hard to describe the plot let just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend won make commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as teen who has chance encounter with famous tv star he turns out to be nice guy who doesn care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans this story has shocking twist and tragic end that did not see coming it is the first time ever felt any compassion for character created by arraki and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft he works better with the camera this time around especially in the early scenes halfway through the film didn necessarily find myself enjoying the film but it seemed like considerable improvement on the doom generation then as the movie went on arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads twisted sex games and alien abductions it sad because he almost actually had some decent material here but he ruined it with his usual in your face such renegade maverick filmmaker look what can do attitude the performances are generally better than in the doom generation which isn saying much at least we don have to suffer jonathan am the most hideous man in america schaech we are however treated to another round of james more wooden than keanu duval sarah lassez gives the best performance in the film and kathleen robertson formerly of 90210 and now arraki wife and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess of the tv star cameos john ritter is the most interesting as deranged right wing tv evangelist if prefer nowhere to the doom generation it is only in the way that would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture maybe greg arraki doesn want you to like his characters maybe he wants to laugh and make fun of those of us who try to care about them maybe he just wanted to piss me off if so he was successful
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned to assess alex cox film the winner as loser would be so indolent it would be derisive it would be glib it would be dismissive it would be entirely accurate rarely have seen film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner would be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious unfunny and unengaging the film attempts to be fresh and quirky utilising myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous the film is set in las vegas and the focus in the winner is on philip vincent onofrio an aloof naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck he virtually cannot lose at the tables despite this prodigious talent philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities consequently he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent louise rebecca demornay sultry lounge singer insinuates herself into philip life for the purpose of swindling him while philip estranged brother and conveniently louise ex beau johnny michael madsen arrives on the scene to add some colour johnny also happens to be toting their father corpse sans one hand meanwhile philip is also befriended by trio of low rent opportunists frank whaley billy bob thornton and richard edson who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddy gift with the dice serenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner delroy lindo it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorsese casino which details the organization hierarchy of casino operations he is the eye in the sky it could be maddening to endure film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation but fortunately this is not the case in the winner if only because our sadsack hero is such sap not even remotely sympathetic or compelling it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate and the would be swindlers of philip fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with complete sense of disinterest it is shame as the winner features talented cast mr onofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with huge range mr lindo has remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears mr madsen ms demornay and mr whaley have all done good work in the past none of the actors in the winner are in top form here and this film won likely be prized addition to their respective resumes director alex cox does what he can with wendy riss screenplay and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of stage play was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one while tedious the film is well paced and does not meander but it would be near impossible task for mr cox or for that matter virtually any other director that comes to mind to overcome the film widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization to his credit my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others screened to be honest though couldn begin to isolate what could be done to this film to improve it assume that throwing the whole thing out and starting over is out of the question the winner has apparently played on cable television in the united states and is beginning limited theatrical release at the time of this writing the film has nice upbeat score by pray for rain but am honestly not being facetious when state that the thing treasured most about my screening of the winner was the bag of popcorn upon which was munching
writer director lawrence kasdan had hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s yes that right he co wrote raiders of the lost ark 10 the empire strikes back 10 and return of the jedi 10 now with this film it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing and guess what he succeeds once again plot man with shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into small american town where he pretends to be licensed psychologist to an open armed swarm of people with problems it isn long before he befriends the small town billionaire folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients critique this film is not comedy it is drama say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer you would think that this film secures its base in humor but unfortunately for us it does not it is serious film seriously flawed if you ask me but digress which offers couple of witty quips to keep you awake but overall just sits there now on to my review this movie sucks because it was slow and boring starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst and certified it all with many predictable ending have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture but whatever it was he missed anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff piece which on good day might be described as predictably digestible it no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as comedy it sucks as drama and bored my movie cohort right to sleep ve given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks first of all couldn help but think about how much the lead actor loren dean looked like young charles grodin he even acted like him save for the dry sardonic wit this kept me interested in watching him at least number two and this one is really shallow seemed to be geared that way as well there were quite few titshots as they would say back in high school and god help me if can get enough of those in an aimless drama and three and this one surprised me the most actor ted danson cameo yes he will always be sam malone to us real fans was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as different person different asshole but different person nonetheless if ever you rent this movie one day promise you won throw away your hard earned money at the theaters wait for his scene because it actually pretty good other than that drab drab drab and drab even jason lee personal favorite of mine was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in while well at least he finally came out and did some real skateboarding in this movie oh yeah and guess that the fourth point in my rating anyway if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist this film your bag otherwise skip it and see analyze this 10 again now there great shrink movie little known facts about this film and its stars three company fans alert terri from the tv show also known as actress priscilla barnes plays small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film the scene is actually fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage so stay tuned kids also it is to note that the actress was once named penthouse pet of the month in march of 1976 she was known as one joann witty back then she originally from jersey who the hell is loren dean the dude who plays mumford in this film you got me but all know is that he was born in las vegas in 1969 and played the character of billy bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name jason lee was born in the state of california in the year of 1971 he was professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats 10 and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp he been in every kevin smith film except for clerks 10 listen closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film the ballooning actor formerly known as pruit taylor vince make reference to the lost ark which is obviously an in joke considering that it is the writer director of this film lawrence kasdan who co wrote raiders of the lost ark 10 kasdan also played the part of dr green in 1997 as good as it gets 10 ted danson also played the role of lawyer peter lowenstein in kasdan 1981 directorial debut body heat starring sexy kathleen turner and william hurt
wesley snipes is master of selecting bad action roles murder at 1600 marshals money train drop zone boiling point and the ultimate camp film passenger 57 the art of war is another entry in this very ugly and unique category ultimately it is little more than ridiculous action film with plot as believable as the warren report ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe and terrible acting by list actors like michael biehn and anne archer oddly it feels like the undiscovered sequel to another snipes masterpiece rising sun the movie revolves around the convenient story of special un operative caught up in secret murder conspiracy involving chinese ambassador the chinese triad brotherhood rich chinese businessman played by that bad guy from rising sun cary hiroyuki tagawa chinese un interpreter and inexplicably donald sutherland the film ends with more confusion than boatload of chinese immigrants trying to register at ellis island or should say the film ends with the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix and all of john woo hong kong films combined am really at loss to figure out why wesley snipes had the gumption to not only star in this action dud but also act as one of the producers of the film usually enjoy snipes movies though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his action films simply am amazed by the how inane the script was filled with terrible cliches and extremely violent action sequences director christian duguay screamers has strange attraction to the viciousness of violent acts showing splattering brains people impaled with broken shards of glass and lots of gargling and gagging as blood sprays everywhere it also sickens me to know that oliver stone one of the greatest directors working today had his hand in producing this monstrosity guess snipes sold stone on the conspiracy angle and stone chose not to read the script watch the dailies be involved in casting or anything else or else he be filing court order to remove his name from the credits it also seems evident that with the russkies as our new bosom buddies and the middle eastern terrorist angle being beaten to death in the last couple of years that the new international enemies in hollywood are the communist chinese sure over the next couple of months even more chinese conspiracy martial arts action flicks are going to be popping up in your local multiplex hopefully they won include wesley snipes
the kirmizi violin is cold sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached it movie that seems almost clinical as it traces the 300 plus years history of the legendary musical instrument of the title opening in the 17th century the story shows how violin maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as gift for his unborn son but when tragedy strikes the violin becomes the personification of its maker grief from there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery again tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds home in england and in mao communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz samuel jackson who mounts painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity the violin becomes morritz obsession just as it is for all those who converge on montreal auction house to bid on it morritz however is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creator intention the kirmizi violin could have been touching inspirational story as soaring as beethoven symphony however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer here is story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact girard for some unknown reason uses mostly master shots keeping his camera and thus us at distance we get no feel for the miracle that is the violin it resonance its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression nor are any of the performances memorable it as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin the kirmizi violin promises much but delivers little it is dull at times bit pretentious and might murky the movie music soars over its story and performers and that is its only saving grace
if you ve seen the trailers or commercials it rather difficult to really figure out what this movie has in store well it hard to tell after watching the movie as well bruce willis is resident of the future and it is rather bleak future the world population had disintigrated into mere 200 000 and is no longer ruled by humans but animals the reason in 1995 an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world with pure virus thus wiping out practically the world population in mere month bruce willis character is one of the surviving few but is enslaved by scientists as are most of last living humans they barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment and having him do the ultimate task go into the past find the leader of the army of the 12 monkeys and kill him well this explanation didn come easy although the movie is very thought provoking of us as people our future and the evilo in the world as story it is very confusing and dragging know movie isn keeping my interest when fidget in my seat or feel the need to look at my watch only to find that it only been an hour passed terry gilliam has certain style that realize many appreciate and haven watched his previous work brazil but this movie felt like it took too long to tell and yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy to figure out you wish it were more complex and not to mention that the movie is depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me
well here distasteful thoroughly amateurish item that surprisingly was actually box office hit at the time of its release after just viewing the film for the first time my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy this movie it is cheap idiotic unfunny and not nearly as raunchy as had heard it was at least some smut would have livened things up bit porky tells the story if you can call it that of four clueless high school buddies pee wee dan monahan billy mark herrier tommy wyatt knight and mickey roger wilson whom desperately want to get laid women for the most part are mystery to them and in this movie they are to the audience as well since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from different planet their plan is sidetracked however when they venture out to smarmy strip bar named porky which they are able to get into using fake id after they pay the manager one hundred bucks for three hookers they are played trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building for these four teenage guys this means war on porky porky ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level as teenage sex romp it is not wild or amusing enough as comedy all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat as look back at the 1950 it is something suspect most people from that era would want to bury deep in grave and as revenge movie it is crushing bore one of the most offensive things about porky is how jaw droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers the four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters and we learn very little about them except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in preschool that sure is revealing information the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark the women are all treated as objects or comedy props rather than real people for example the two gym teachers mrs balbricker nancy parsons and honeywell kim cattrall only have one purpose and that is to be made fun of mrs balbricker is gruff no holds barred overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness and in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved honeywell has sex with coach and barks like dog there is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses even though have the suspicion they are not but one thing is for sure they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny only humiliating to prove how out of touch this so called comedy is compare it to other more serious 80 films about teenagers and it looks even worse in comaprison any of the john hughes pictures such as 1984 sixteen candles or 1985 the breakfast club put porky at an even greater shame those films actually dealt with serious teen matters but remained great deal funnier thanks to their bright and truthful writing and heck if porky wanted to be teenage sex movie take 1982 fast times at ridgemont high or 1982 the last american virgin over this any day of the week director bob clark is not bad director two years after he made porky he directed the nostalgic holiday classic christmas story would forgive him for this misfire in fact if it wasn for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay just the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such piece of garbage and think that it was actually film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world is actually whole lot funnier than anything in porky
preposterous religious action film produced by the trinity broadcasting network about code hidden within the text of the bible that when deciphered will lead to the end of the world nice of those bible authors to put doomsday code into the most read book ever eh michael york plays millionaire diplomat who breaks the code and sets out to become god on earth and fulfill the doomsday prophecies while casper van dien terribly miscast and giving an awful performance as result plays the atheist motivational speaker who must stop him michael ironside great as always despite the silly film surrounding him plays fallen priest and right hand man to michael york character here some subtle character development you may have missed pertaining to ironside character now despite the fact that we see him murder man in the opening scene the filmmakers aren quite sure if their audience will understand that he is evil how do they fix that make specific efforts to show that his character is the only one in the film who smokes there are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking oooooo scary but even that wasn enough for the filmmakers apparently as they later have to infer that ironside character is gay it comes out of nowhere and just makes no sense my main problem with this film is that despite the silly story which could have been pulled off anything can be made believable if executed correctly the events of the film aren shown with any sense of urgency or importance for example at one point york character is declared chancellor of the world or something and we see one brief cheesy news report about it the movie keeps telling us that the apocalypse is coming but it never seems that way there no world reaction to anything the omega code is available on dvd from goodtimes home video it contains the film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 85 and includes the original theatrical trailer documentary on the making of the film production notes and cast and crew information the documentary runs about 25 minutes and is actually surprisingly good it looks as though it was made for broadcast on tbn and it does comprehensive job of interviewing practically everyone in the cast and crew with the exception of michael ironside unfortunately the best thing about it is that whenever crew members are interviewed they do an excellent job of explaining their profession and exactly what it is they do on movie set most documentaries tend to overlook this doomsday expert hal lindsey is even interviewed you ll remember his documentary from the 1970 called the late great planet earth where lindsey speculated that jimmy carter might actually be the antichrist however at the very beginning of the documentary the producers of the film managed to get on my bad side when interviewed they actually have the nerve to say ever see raiders of the lost ark well our film is like that no it isn not by long shot [pg 13]
there are scenes in the big hit that are so awful they simply defy description the movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made last action hero 1993 such chore to sit through presumably the big hit is an action comedy difficult but not impossible genre to pull off movies of this sort require fine balance and careful tone and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence lethal weapon 1989 is perfect example of an action thriller that was also very very funny unfortunately in the big hit it seems that comedy is the main motive and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs unfortunately there are no laughs the movie resembles some of the goofy throwaway ridiculousness of early jackie chan films but it doesn benefit from chan incredible stunts and goofy charismatic presence instead we are left with lot of digital effects and mark wahlberg who must have considered himself invincible after his critically acclaimed performance in last year boogie nights however if he wants to maintain decent career he had better start selecting his projects more carefully movies like this are sure fire recipe for long career in the straight to video market wahlberg plays melvin smiley an amiable guy who also happens to be professional hitman see grosse pointe blank for the same character much better developed the movie wants us to think gee how clever and ironic guy who can kill without any moral implications and yet he can stand for anyone not to like him the fact is melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee christina applegate with horrendous new york accent and an abusive girlfriend lela rochon who is only using him for his money his constant bending over backwards to please people makes him complete patsy at best and thoroughly unbelievable character at worst melvin is employed exclusively by crime boss named paris avery brooks as part of team of hitmen which also includes cisco lou diamond phillips and crunch bokeem woodbine one day melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter of rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi sab shimono for million dollar ransom however not only has jiro nishi lost all his money producing big hollywood movie inside joke get it but his kidnapped daughter keiko china chow also happens to be paris goddaughter so when paris finds out she been kidnapped he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it not knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper of course cisco blames the whole thing on poor innocent melvin along the way there are several obligatory gunfights explosions and car chases plus literal cliffhanger inspired by jurassic park and completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko who looks like she barely pushing fifteen what the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers hara kiri drinking problems leaking body bags and running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation and now spends all his time doing hand exercises not to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of king kong lives which is two weeks overdue this mess of movie was helmed by che kirk wong the latest hong kong director imported by john woo face off who also served as executive producer woo needs to stop acting as conduit for other directors and start making more of his own films wong who directed such films as rock roll cop back in hong kong is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy maybe jokes about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are funny across the ocean but they re not here at least in the manner wong handles them many of the problems can be traced back to the script which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey in addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences ramsey script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet style dialogue what he comes out with is just lot of annoying blather most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips whose favorite phrase is it all love and robin dunne who plays cisco stuttering black wannabe assistant the irritation factor of phillips and dunne combined is almost off the scale which can pretty much describe the film as whole
tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance and into studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi tiered marketing materials for crap movies and here he hits rock bottom with planet of the apes didn expect much from this latest interpretation of pierre boulle classic novel planet of the apes mean how could you top the force and impact of the original film intelligently co scripted by rod serling of twilight zone fame combined with the overbearing chuck heston growling and yelling at those damn dirty apes in one of his best roles of his career sadly sat down to watch burton version of planet of the apes and within the first 20 minutes was checking my watch and my girlfriend big fan of the original film started to nod off this time around the story plays out like cross between enemy mine braveheart and project marky mark wahlberg who was enjoyable in boogie nights and the corrupter plays leo davidson hot shot air force pilot leo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic storms no real explanation given in the film and leo sends one of his genetically altered smart chimps into the storms to collect data leo and his crew lose communication with the chimp leo hops in another ship to find the monkey and then he thrown through some type of time space wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle leo ends up getting captured by group of talking apes and is sold to slave trader named limbo paul giamatti who in turn sells leo to chimpanzee named ari helena bonham carter the kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leo ship along the way monkeys played by tim roth overacting his role of vicious general named thade and michael clarke duncan who further enhances his career by playing another heavy in bad action movie strive out to hunt down leo and his band of human savages just like battlefield earth in the end it all culminates into another braveheart rip off human versus ape battle scene while rick baker makeup work is amazing the script is pathetic hodgepodge courtesy of three writers the acting is horrible and the surprise ending feels like swing from ball peen hammer into the temple wahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences this remake or re interpretation as tim burton has proclaimed it is an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film the ethical arguments about the equality of species fascism and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue an unimaginative narrative structure and romance between monkey and human even chuck heston anti gun tirade in the de rigeur cameo seems shallow and jokey but the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton even though his name is plastered across every billboard in america john badham could have directed this film even joel schumacher could have directed this film he probably should have burton predominant themes of rejection isolation and the search for one place in the universe as seen in ed wood edward scissorshands and pee wee big adventure are completely absent in this planet suppose that what happen when great director gets sucked through wormhole
chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get reaction from you either find his helium voice crazy eyes and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying think fall into the former category one of the few who thought his turn in the fifth element as prancing prince like deejay was complete inspired lunacy and not the least bit aggravating but his new vehicle money talks just doesn do him service tucker is good in the movie and this is the kind of film that if people see it could make him big star but he also really the only thing good about the movie in fact if you see money talks it should shock you beyond recognition that two of toy story writers penned the sloppy script tucker role here is that of franklin hatchett petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell charlie sheen after being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports franklin finds himself on bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard gerard ismael but villard thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist franklin is allowed to escape as well but not before overhearing some important information regarding diamond stash that for some reason or another is being hidden in vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo the local media mistakenly puts the prison break out blame on franklin which is where james comes back into the picture he makes deal to protect franklin if in turn franklin gives him an exclusive interview this means james must present his new friend in the stickiest of situations formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace heather locklear also attended by her uber rich parents veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino and of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james this ain no buddy movie claim the print ads yeah right actually for the better part of oh 20 minutes it appears money talks has the momentum to cover entertaining ground and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker this is tucker first leading role and if you imagine slightly lankier african american jim carrey with reliance on wild rated raunch rather than pg 13 physical comedy you have good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role but you realize all too quickly that tucker overstated liveliness is the only thing money talks has going for it and lively actor alone does not successful movie make it all too easy to pick out everything wrong with money talks the plot is recycled buddy buddy comedy thriller tripe that seemed overused even when nothing to lose employed it last month everything is paint by numbers especially the los angeles coliseum finale which finds not one not two but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers the villains as many as there are are dull certain story elements are too coincidental and too much of the film dramatic agenda is played too straight scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin true identity you brought killer into my parents house is extremely silly you get the picture obviously did not have pleasant experience at money talks but the people around me appeared to be having rip roaring good time one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction began fearing for his health but tucker at least for me is pretty funny guy and aces the movie best scene where franklin passes himself off as vic damone son at james and grace engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry beyaz lyrics tucker audience and he does have one will probably like money talks those who he irritates however will have more productive day staying home and scraping the gook out from under their toenails
the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for secret mission he attempts to pop couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth but misses after they ricochet off his face he says not good start as it turns out this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence but to the rest of the movie as well in this the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong chan plays an international operative codenamed condor and is tasked by the united nations with finding stash of altin hidden at secret base by the nazi during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war for some reason condor is given his mission at the embassy in spain think this may have been done so that in chase scene they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over fruit cart watch for it in any chase scene set in foreign country most notably in europe the chase will take itself through marketplace and fruit cart will be overturned it almost guarantee anyway condor is given key which is supposed to unlock giant vault in which the altin is hidden the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it which may mean booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly to help him figure out where the altin is hidden and how to use the key correctly condor is accompanied by desert expert carol cheng and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the altin eva cobo there aren supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something although these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts in fact most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just way to set up fight suppose this isn so bad since chan action is really the best part of the movie and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway if you ve never seen jackie chan movie don expect great plot but do expect to be entertained by his moves they are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human knowing that he does his own stunts and knowing that this is the real stuff no computer masked bungee cords here makes the action sequences all the more exciting you ve got to hand it to guy who probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art also of note in this as in any jackie chan movie is the humor as far as know none of his films take themselves too seriously and even the dramatic parts have certain tongue in cheek quality about them what is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes unlike martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme where the fights get you on the visceral level fight scenes in chan movies are simply entertaining you marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such way to make you laugh unfortunately even chan mastery can save this film the plot and characters are so weak that they don hold the movie together at all and the acting is terrible carol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past but since operation condor is dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off this combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until heard those kicks start flying
one night during torrential downpour that flooded the streets we went to see what else hard rain so are we all going to die the sheriff randy quaid asks in the story opening line as he evacuates his flooded town the answer is pretty much yes but not nearly soon enough and to add insult to injury the supposedly dead regretfully often turn out not to be so populating this bad tv movie of the week material are host of talented actors one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water they will all receive siyah marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie graham yost script serves up one cliche after another for the actors who thankfully managed to mumble quite few of the lines director mikael salomon staging is so confusing that you may have trouble figuring out what is happening the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies jr dark and ugly cinematography the plot concerns an armored car that gets stuck in the raging water onboard are guards tom and his uncle charlie christian slater who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart plays tom edward asner drops by briefly to take on the role of the soon to be dead charlie coming to their rescue is gang headed by jim played on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman he views the loot three million dollars worth as his retirement plan the entire movie is one big watery chase with the sheriff and his posse tracking jim and his gang who are in turn after tom along the way tom picks up love interest in the person of crucifix weapon wielding woman named karen played in totally wasted performance by minnie driver the action sequences are repetitive and without much interest they do feature lots of explosions and gunfire to keep you awake christopher young emotionless score for the film has single trait ear shattering loudness the plot holes are as big as the ones in the dam that breaks submerging the town the characters have an infinite number of bullets and rarely do they have to bother reloading their guns the weapons and the ammunition spend most of the time under water or being rained on but always fire perfectly when one of the bad guys drops gun into the water it stays in the same place until much later when tom swims to get it even though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees counting these improbabilities is one of the more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait for the characters to kill each other the show has single but unprintable good line betty beyaz plays an incessantly bossy wife and when her hen pecked husband finally told her off our audience roared with laughter the show concludes with sickening set of twists the best that can be said of the picture is that it is merely stupefyingly awful as opposed to laughably bad hard rain runs 37 it is rated for violence and would be fine for teenagers the two families behind us shockingly had half dozen preschoolers among them
it was with huge lack of something to do that decided to watch this on good old upn on sunday afternoon when the only good things on tv are the second rate movies they show some are good they showed total recall before this one if you know me think seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live and this includes keanu reeves what do hate about seagal hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening and non threatening situation the squint hate those scenes in every movie where he goes around bullying people up saying stupid lines with brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynold hairpiece in boogie nights despise how he never gets bruise in any of his fights hate how every single plot twist leads to just melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain hate his non satirical messages in the beginning of this one he slaps on quote from arthur miller which has nothing to do with the film except it about brooklyn where this film takes place and hate how he so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing during the end credits he has good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him sure the guy probably nice guy in person actually found him very non threatening when he was on letterman not too long ago but the guy makes worse films than reagan did so what the plot of this shit terpiece well something about him trying to catch stupid ass crook william forsythe who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight couldn believe how bad this scene was the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect ahem and forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off sorry did anyone ever hear of concealing one self so in comes ex brooklynite seagal who dedicates his life to catching this guy and just wished he had caught him in the beginning then ended the film but noooo this drags on as he bullies forsythe family members including stupid bar owner and none other than gina gershon as his other bar owner sister and forsythe more than once threatens his family at one point he actually comes to their house and stalks them like non threatening nicholson in the shining complete with them all hiding in the bathroom but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away seagal paints himself as lovable person with son and fiancee he even shows him hanging with his son checking up on his homework and then about to take him out for bit of catch when he conveniently called away on assignment dunno about you but playing catch with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares he also shows him as that bad ass he wants to be with scenes of him bullying crooks around and taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after he unarmed chinese guy swinging bats with pool cue serves them right this film as some of his do has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented but don appear to be in this film already mentioned gina gershon who pretty horrible in this one as well as william forsythe who over acts terribly know this guy can act he was awesome in raising arizona as goodman partner in crime but he just awful here jerry orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down why is he the only one who gives good performance well because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility he seems to be in here just to give it cool law and order feeling even if it not cool feeling and in cameos are rated erotic thriller cinemax style stars shannon whirry as terry malloy which is more of bad joke than clever one and athena massey oh and er julliana margiulles has two scenes out for justice just proves once again that american action films just suck know that there such good thing as good action he called john woo but if you re in the mood for some good old no brainer fun yet dumb action don bother watching this it so stupid that it boring
in the 13th warrior arab poet ahmed ibn fahdlan antonio banderas finds himself kicked out of baghdad for feeling up the king old lady with his translator screen legend omar sharif in small role ahmed heads north to act as ambassador to the northmen vikings he finds group of warriors mourning the loss of their king messenger soon arrives from another kingdom requesting assistance soothsayer says that thirteen warriors must answer the summons twelve northmen and one outsider thus ahmed becomes the 13th warrior on the trip ahmed manages to learn the vikings language by listening to their fireside conversations bit far fetched it true but we have to swallow it if this flick is going to manage few lines of dialogue amidst the grunting ahmed who called ibn by the vikings forms friendships with herger the joyous dennis storh and the viking leader buliwyf vladimir kulich when they arrive in the other kingdom the thirteen warriors discover that they re facing an army of supernatural cannibals that live up in the caves hereafter most of the movie is battle scenes the cannibals attack the vikings the vikings attack the cannibals the cannibals attack the well you get the idea just to add some action there also viking vs viking duel other movies insert scenes between the fights these scenes are called character development suspect that the 13th warrior had better script at one time and that it fell through the cracks because of the tag team direction the movie started off in the hands of john mctiernan you ll notice lot of similarities between warrior and mctiernan predator including the chittering jungle sounds somewhere along the line mctiernan bailed and michael crichton took over crichton whose novel eaters of the dead is the basis for warrior has directed small assortment of goofy science fiction thrillers westworld coma looker runaway their result of their consecutive efforts is murky and pointless movie perhaps what the 13th warrior needs more than anything else is villain the eaters of the dead are faceless mob in blackface they have no personality and by the end they don even seem particularly threatening the audience has no target toward which to channel its aggression mctiernan should know about the importance of an interesting villain it was his die hard that made villains seem fun and attracted big name stars to the evil roles in action films the 13th warrior suffers from lack of vision it wants to be predator meets braveheart meets the magnificent seven meets dances with wolves with so many competing goals all it can do is echo what it might have been it might have been satisfying action film it might have been beautifully rendered medieval epic it might have been thought provoking examination of the meeting of cultures what shame it turned out to be nothing in particular bottom line if you want to see antonio swing his sword rent the mask of zorro
for film touted as exploring relationships and siyah sexuality trois is surprisingly tame despite it lurid subject matter and it passing nod to fatal attraction it moves along with flat uninspired dialogue as it sets up surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film freshly moved to atlanta jermaine dourdan and his wife jasmine moore have the trappings of perfect life they have beautiful house in suburbia jermaine is lawyer on the fast track at his firm jasmine is his supportive wife who is finishing up her college degree in an opening montage via home video of the pair we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs this is couple that has it all into this eden slithers the lure of lust despite his outward appearance jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as possession than person glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business oblivious to jasmine concerns we also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in menage trois much to jasmine dismay as jermaine puts it don you want to be sexually free jermaine shares his desire with co worker terrence smith who obligingly sets jermaine up with woman who might be interested in just such an encounter the woman jade palmer is direct counterpoint to jasmine jade at one point was college student too unlike jasmine she found herself pregnant dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet to further reinforce their differences it revealed that jade is involved in custody battle over her son inevitably through liquor and touch of duplicity on jermaine part the forbidden act is consummated the aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaine property with the hint that the violence may escalate by this point trois shows itself to be soap opera without the requisite melodrama fatal attraction without the social significance the exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical jermaine comes off as insincere sexually driven and selfish jasmine is bland and subservient jade comes off bit sympathetically but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy yet another tale of sexually aggressive dog of man who imposes his will upon his accommodating innocent mate the last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you curve but by this point will you even care if the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending perhaps there could have been some freshness to it as it stands trois is pretty standard fare
it difficult to expect much from director whose greatest accomplishments to date are handful of award winning tv commercials as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes that said hayes feature film debut lives up to expectations coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic but occasionally bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the film two stars jake gyllenhall as the immuno deficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his over protective hyper religious reagan loving mother gyllenhall sweet natured delivery of jimmy hilariously na ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy coming of age story jimmy is bubble boy kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with single germ plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld his mom home schools jimmy filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and anti sexual messages until he befriended by chloe marley shelton the beautiful girl next door jimmy falls in love with chloe but is afraid that his love will literally kill him as evidenced in scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for kiss but when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend jimmy builds bubble suit and embarks on hijinks addled cross country voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love the offensive bits have little to do with jimmy rare handicap regardless of what the film protesters would have you believe but instead center on outrageous racial stereotypes including screaming chinese strip club owner and devout east indian hindi but even if you find stereotype humor funny it hard to muster more than giggle for these shallow gags they even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with group of carnival freaks but few of the harsh jabs manage to work especially in the case of kurtz who very bluntly shows the dark hypocritical side of the religious right and wacky send up of cult called bright shiny led by the inimitable fabio unfortunately few giggles can make bubble boy the riotous off the wall comedy it so desperately wants to be honestly it mystery how on earth this movie was ever made and not just saying that because it so mediocre how odd for disney to take gamble on film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that doesn seem to appeal to any particular demographic and has the potential to offend so many and now that the studio is suffering through very public protest against the film by the parents of real life bubble boy david philip vetter maybe disney wondering the same thing hope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile
bats is this year camp flick with the world worst dialogue cheesiest premise and stupidest editor this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity as for the rest of us well say skip it but looking at the box office figures for this one it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway follow their lead and you ll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and bucks to boot love alfred hitchcock the birds almost as much as love the short story on which it is based it saddens me even more then to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror schlock such as bats when mysterious bat attacks occur in small texas town the authorities call in batologist dina meyer to investigate it turns out that creepy scientist bob gunton has genetically enhanced couple bats that escaped from his lab making them smarter and more vicious why has he done this you ask because you see it is apparently scientist job to make things little better even if that means the death of all mankind so the batologist her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff lou diamond phillips have to kill all the bats and save the world of course that can happen before they wallow in some guamo bat shit for the uninitiated get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in professionally produced motion picture consider for example scene where two people are in bat cave the bats are all sleeping but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out what do they do do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can nope they stand there for while transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes we don even get to see what going on the screen becomes mush because the cuts are so quick all we know is that bats are attacking how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains mystery little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies and bats sure could use some of course director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor but it is so conventional it doesn really go anywhere most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist wisecracking sidekick leon who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like hate bats some of these are so bad that they take on double quality they may inspire smirk by their very nature and roaring laugh because they are so inept hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one liners playing such characters does not help actors careers still suppose that if you re looking for movie that is so bad it good you could do worse than bats it does have tremendous amount of camp value not recommending the movie because quite frankly it sucks and know that this might convince some people to go out and see it more power to them

had an epiphany today it occurred to me while was watching house on haunted hill it is as follows if trailer makes the film it advertising look like trashy stupid movie well guess what chances are there is truth in advertising too bad didn trust my own instincts when something or the other possessed me to see this movie blame it on my sudden craving for scare and my anticipation of sleepy hollow that and dogma started too late in the afternoon for my schedule an hour of angel or buffy is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face wish seen it when it was halloween at least would have been forgiving hey tis the season the movie was scary albeit very confusing dizzying and nauseating at first but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn going anywhere now truly appreciate films like scream halloween or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic that what spooks people out the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know there has to be logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with sure utterly unpredictable is good too but that different from utterly nonsensical hohh house on haunted hill on the other hand well let just say about fell off my chair laughing when they oh so cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house couple of decades ago riiiiight know that just sends chills down my spine yeah just like wet my pants when they told me the house is evil ooooooo hint blood and guts only work few times sooner or later people start to tell themselves that it just ketchup and props and you ve got to come up with something better than that there were just too many things in this movie that we ve all seen before from the inevitable plot developments of strangers unwittingly trapped together strangers turning against each other the evil manifesting itself the dead coming back for last scare each was more predictable than the last why didn these fools just stay together in one place anyways sheesh was grossed out yes did get spooked few times yes but why get really disturbed when there is no why when there weren random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect which wasn that good either trust me and the scare the film was filled with drab laughable dialogue the characters were incredibly flat and cliched not to mention downright annoying you ve got bunch of people going nowhere in their lives of course they re dumb enough to go to party some stranger invited them to provided they win million dollars if they survive the night jeez thought no one fell for those you may already be winner things anymore and of course all three gals are babes wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of shine ended up in this movie keep that up geoff and you ll qualify for the next batman venture the only single person enjoyed was chris kattan because well he just cracks me up and famke jansen sp because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan pierce brosnan hey willingly endured dante peak three times for him all right concede there were couple of things enjoyed that perverted little amusement park at the beginning probably won ride rollercoaster for while and the machine they used to drive geoffrey character mad see don even remember their names the machine not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie it wouldn have redeemed the film but at least it would have made me feel better but no they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending thank god they didn add kiss at the end or would have puked god there is no hope
director andrew davis reworks his fugitive formula and the results are about as exciting as his last film the dreadful comedy steal big steal little was funny keanu rather play music than play another action hero reeves is the grad student on the run who along with his superfluous sidekick rachel weisz has been framed for sabotaged science experiment that vaporized eight chicago city blocks the mushroom cloud explosion is knock out and easily the best part of the movie or as one audience member succinctly summed it up whoa false information implicates their involvement and boy and girl are soon on the run fleeing over open drawbridges across icy lakes and through the corridors of power at top secret underground energy facility aiding and abetting is the team shady mentor played in an excellent but so what performance by morgan freeman brit brian cox is also about as the behind the scenes bad guy he has some fun fiddling with southern accent unfunny overscored and without single shred of suspense chain reaction is the summer movie to walk out on if you make it to the end mess of cross cutting involving another imminent explosion you ll hear somebody say guess it time to go heed that warning
suave cool collected rich uptight bad guy cliche clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs cliche bad guy who owns wild animal cliche crooked chauvinistic law enforcer type cliche at an intense moment our main character tries to get away but the car has trouble starting cliche complaining about cliches cliche ok ok so we always hear about cliches but if there was ever to be prime example the real mccoy is it not one uttered word not one frame of film not one character in this whole movie isn cut and paste example of everything we ve ever seen they might as well use this as training film how to make bank robbery film in the 90 karen mccoy kim basinger is bank robber who just got out on parole after six year stay at the state prison she wants to make things right and go straight especially with the fact that she has six year old son out there who doesn even know she alive aware of mccoy bank robbing expertise sniveling bad guy jack schmidt terence stamp uses the same six year old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18+ million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier which by the way is somehow due to schmidt and if she refuses who knows what he ll do to the kid cue sinister laughter this movie is so pathetically pitiful that it hard to know where to begin the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant can stress enough how every single element whether it be character the dialogue plot twist etc is so damn generic that you ll wonder if anyone is working behind the scenes let alone in front of the camera basinger is absolutely vacant and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her here someone that spent their time robbing banks and now as she heads onto the street we re supposed to feel sorry for her as she confronts her son who doesn even know who she is are we supposed to break into tears especially when neither basinger nor zach english who plays the kid has any depth or emotional radiance whatsoever suppose should mention val kilmer yeah that right he in it quite sadly too seeing as how can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name and he got second billing to be fair will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe barker unfortunately the script doesn allow much room for improvement and when his character is used like bookends he never shows up in the middle of the film we have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project the real mccoy just can keep it head above water and soon very soon sinks into cliched mess of movie the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer and the dialogue particularly schmidt trite dialogue falls like the niagra this is definitely one to avoid folks the real mccoy is anything but

the haunting film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of horror film to scare us if you ve ever seen movie which you probably have considering you are on this website you should know about all of the trivia they post before movie they have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film but the one always like are the &quot other name&quot joke that try and rename particular film for instance the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film small soldiers they had titles like little infantry and can get those fatigues in smaller size well after seeing the haunting had few particular names for it as well unfortunately can only post one of them otherwise be getting some pretty angry mails from overprotective mothers that title would be the confusing ok that is pretty bad title but it fits this film perfectly it basically serves up no purpose and combined with dry dialogue and boring and confusing plot it completes the formula for cinematic bomb liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in film without any depth but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth the haunting is nothing but trash but unfortunately will still make boatload of money before rant and rave about how bad this film is let me point out the few and stress the word few bright spots in this film first the house is great looking it looks beautiful but this is also dark spot it looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it this is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film things look so great that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie the hill house is not eerie it is beautiful but not the least bit frightening ever heard of lili taylor before this film did not but am glad that do now she gives the only satisfactory performance in the film despite the dry dialogue and boring confusing concept she manages to light up the screen every time she appears but unfortunately her co stars are usually following right behind owen wilson who plays luke is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance other then taylor he is basically there for the comic relief and his character development is poor in all other areas all of the characters are desperately underdeveloped wilson had potential as luke but it seems they just needed him to add few laughs liam neeson and catherine zeta jones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film their characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot they just are not believable and this is the final nail in the haunting coffin the plot is terrible the opening scene of the film is very important but the director makes it too obvious by getting close ups of all the things that will play major role in the end of the film as sat through the film kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish nell lili taylor character goes from the hunted to the savior it makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film he forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any in depth information for instance the beginning of the film gives us sense of why nell is getting involved in the program but we get zilch for the other four plus two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes and the worst part most horror films have killings for some reason they kill off luke at the end of the film no reason whatsoever just off with his head literally overall the haunting is the epitome of bad movie bad plot confusing storyline and waste of good talent hopefully liam neeson can rebound and get into good film and be used to his full potential hopefully lili taylor will be recognized for doing such great job in such bad film and hopefully other horror films such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house will not be as bad as this one
making your first feature film ain easy assemble decent if not strong cast as writer director robert moresco has done with one eyed king and you re already ahead of the game but rehash old plot lines tired dialogue and standard clich and well intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at second feature film how many more movies do we need about rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade filmmaker from making yet another but here we have it again five irish kids in nyc hell kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop with teary music and slow motion in the film first scene the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as good hearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah blah blah but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points he concerned about buddy jason gedrick heroin abuse he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin character sister he looks into who might be pushing the most moronic looking counterfeit cash ever made genuinely funny touch but none of this ever really amounts to anything it seems that moresco greater concern is to provide that intangible slice of life that flavor of the neighborhood that everyone been trying to evoke since scorsese early work so we get the drunk guys hugging and singing together at the local bar to prove to us that they really love each other do people actually do this we get lot of tough street talk usually mumbled for effect and whole lot of the word whether it sounds like it fits or not we also get handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose bruno kirby chazz palminteri you know guys you ve seen in movies just like this one before assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears and baldwin performance is adequate but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that it almost funny moresco theater guy and sometimes tv writer including the series falcone obviously labored over this one as anyone might first child but the content is probably too personal as result the movie style is heavy handed in need of considerable amount of toning down nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids moresco reminds us boy does he remind us with slow dissolves to the earlier scene running in slow motion complete with dialogue from the present just in case we don comprehend the link to the past moresco needs to either trust his audience intelligence or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it his next project should have little more personal distance and lot more subtlety if he actually gets that chance reviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage feature story coming soon
everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence billy zane is wooden as the hero kristy swanson is given very little to do and does very little with it treat williams looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse is one of the worst villains have ever seen in movie only catherine zeta jones as one of williams cohorts turns in good performance she has energy and spunk which the movie needed much more of oh yeah the phantom also has secret identity but this is so poorly played out you won even care about the only things can recommend are good performance by jones and some colorful scenery however if youre looking for fun family movie go watch the underrated flipper this is not good movie
the corruptor is big silly mess of an action movie complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence it not abhorrent or even blatantly unlikable but it doesn make shred of sense and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film james foley knows lot about characters and acting and those are the strengths of the corruptor but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense and the result is less like movie and more like derailed train at least we have chow yun fat in the lead role chow plays nick chen chinatown cop he good cop as the first few scenes establish and he very familiar with chinatown that probably why the powers that be decide to team him up with rookie named danny wallace mark wahlberg nick and danny begin by stepping on each other toes but finally end up liking each other once they both get chance to save the other one life what happens after that is kind of mystery to me fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons led by young chinese psycho named bobby vu byron mann also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ric young gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny although this makes for some ridiculous albeit unpredictable plot twists along the way there also an interesting subplot revolving around danny father brian cox but it doesn have much to do with the main story one of the problems as said is that the movie doesn make any sense don blame this entirely on foley because he obviously good director more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci script which doesn seem to be in tune to the way normal people act one scene early on had me particularly annoyed nick confronts his boss because he angry about his new beyaz partner he shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture and was thinking that would have fired him if he had done that to me in addition the film takes bite into race related issues and never develops them at all there are lot of scenes like this one and none of them are very coherent there also considerable language barrier given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents the plot itself never straightens out not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are or why henry lee is associated with them or what they do as group the corruptor is an action movie and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences the sequences aren bad but they re not new how many car chases through chinatown have you seen on that note how many chinatown cop movies have you seen one too many imagine foley strength is clearly in characterization and he does pretty good job here the scenes between nick and danny are very good and actually got feel for their characters bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together chow and wahlberg are both good actors chow is pro and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere but he still fun to watch also liked the subplot involving danny father brian cox performance is powerful and his character makes compelling moral compass for danny but the film ultimately fails mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly familiar action scenes complicated plot can be successful but the story needs to make sense when it over the corruptor never manages to make any sense it just keeps spinning out of control until finally there nothing left to hold on to
the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffany in which the audience is rooting for some sweet vulnerable irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo played by sook yin lee as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible alessa is young woman who happens to be brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild adam beach he sees that behind the facade that there is really sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating ben gets emotionally involved with alessa as alessa so delicately puts it we were bosom buddies now we re fuck buddies but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor the real problem with the film seems to be helen lee inability to decide what she wants to be saying she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa alessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients this appears to be high profile and well paid job we are supposed to care about alessa feelings but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father alessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint this is charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up double zero rate it on the to 10 scale and on the to +4 scale
all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos please raise your hands thank you for identifying yourselves now would you all please go away your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade and it shows no sign of abating any time soon it isn just the strobe light quality of your twenty cuts per minute editing or the numbing over use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised featuring the music of no it is kind of cynicism you have perfected banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of story if you include enough bells and whistles welcome to the club scott kalvert your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one dimensional serving only as the vehicle for performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as whole dicaprio stars as jim carroll the new york poet songwriter performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based as the film opens jim is budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey mark wahlberg pedro james madio and neutron patrick mcgaw one night jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine and shortly thereafter to heroin jim addiction to the drug starts him on downhill spiral as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach bruno kirby kicked out of his home by his mother lorraine bracco and drops out of school along with mickey and pedro jim becomes victim of the street living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as project for years but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as character was too unsympathetic and too much loner screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll posse resulting in jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic but now with equally unsympathetic friends as film the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as cautionary tale 100 minute long just say no public service announcement but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie jim is sort of jerk even before he becomes junkie but suppose that his pseudo sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be saw him simply as part of the bad crowd without character who changes in any appreciable way the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung out cohorts all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack director scott kalvert doesn have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work so he substitutes silly slow motion photography self consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing on only one occasion when steady pan around room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in are any of the gimmicks effective mostly they just draw attention to how hollow the story is they also don allow leonardo dicaprio performance to be as strong as it could have been for every impressive moment like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money there is scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors particularly fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex junkie who tries to help jim straighten out but kalvert won let character interaction define this story he wants to turn dicaprio into rock star shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting at isolate moments the basketball diaries is fine showcase for dicaprio talents far more frequently it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what long form velvet underground video might have looked like
star wars episode the phantom menace 1999 director george lucas cast liam neeson ewan mcgregor natalie portman jake lloyd ian mcdiarmid samuel jackson oliver ford davies terence stamp pernilla august frank oz ahmed best kenny baker anthony daniels screenplay george lucas producers rick mccallum runtime 131 min us distribution 20th century fox rated pg mild violence thematic elements copyright 1999 nathaniel atcheson fellow critic once stated his belief that reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review ve attempted to obey this rule in recent months but to do so would be impossible in this case the fact is nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people for me they calibrated my creativity as child they are masterful original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time and they still hold up pretty darn well am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release but that doesn make me any less dedicated to it on the contrary the star wars trilogy and the empire strikes back in particular are three items on very short list of why love movies when heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine film series got exited when first saw screenshots from the film well over year ago embarked on year long drool of anticipation and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving was ready to see the film but then there was the hype the insane marketing campaign and lucasfilm secretive snobbery over the picture in the last weeks before the picture opened while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater was tired of hearing about it was tired of seeing cardboard cut outs of the characters whenever went to kfc or taco bell just wanted to see the movie reader do not misunderstand did not have an anti hype reaction the hype was unavoidable understand and accept the hype it just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released five minutes into the phantom menace knew there was problem who are these jedi knights asked why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine gun rapidity why aren these characters being developed before their adventures why is there special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film these were just some of my questions early on later asked where the magic of the first three films and why am looking at my watch every fifteen minutes by the end of the film was tired maddened and depressed george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into pointless mindless summer blockbuster the phantom menace is no star wars film take away the title and the jedi talk and the force and you re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time it an embarrassment looked desperately for scene in which character is explored or new theme is examined or special effects shot isn used there are few of each but they re all token attempts the fact is george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for movie and pretty good showcase for digital effects this is not what wanted to see didn want to leave the phantom menace with headache and bitter taste in my mouth but did the story centers mostly around qui gon jinn liam neeson looking lost and confused and his apprentice obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor who scarcely has line in the film and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo naboo is the victim of bureaucratic war with the trade federation their contact on naboo is queen amidala natalie portman the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people after picking up jar jar binks completely cgi character voiced by ahmed best they head to tatooine where they meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his mother pernilla august qui gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters there isn anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form the way lucas has handled it however it unsatisfactory first of all we don learn one single thing about qui gon jinn not one thing what was his life like before this film well imagine he didn have one that why he feels like plot device this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role and why he recently retired from film don blame him honestly obi wan character was really looking forward to learning more about is even less interesting mcgregor has just few lines so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in great performance is urged to look elsewhere since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace lucas has served us big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed out character in the film and lloyd does thoughtful job with the role was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting and when anakin says goodbye to his mother found it moving also fairly good is portman and she manages to give little depth to character where no depth has been written jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters ve ever had to endure but he more interesting than most of the humans as soon as the relatively brief segment on tatooine is over it back to the mind numbing special effects and depthless action scenes ve seen many movies that qualify as special effects extravaganzas but the phantom menace is the first one ve seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie the reason is obvious george lucas has no restraint can say that didn find the effects original because did the final battle between darth maul obi wan and qui gon is visually exceptional as is most of the film but also found the effects deadening and tiresome my breaking point was near the end of the picture as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters in the background we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through digital sky and wanted that to go away can we have one stinking scene that isn bursting at the seems with special effects shot got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that really just wanted to go outside and look at physical landscape for few hours and then there the question of magic what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi have feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel john williams familiar score is no help nor is lucas direction think it comes right down to characters there are none here longed for the magnetic presence of han luke and leia but got no such thing and what about the ridiculous expectations mine weren that high simply wanted film that showed me the roots of the films that grew up loving story that had few characters and few great special effects instead got two hours and fifteen minutes of lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show don hate the phantom menace as much as resent it like to forget that it exists and yet can it here to stay can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them because if they don then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series
at first glance thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise its plotline goes like this the evil king cromwell desiring to take over the world resurrects an evil ancient sorceror xusia for power he attacks the kingdom of eh dan and kills young prince talon parents given triple bladed sword which can shoot bad guys like gun by his dying father talon vows for revenge eleven years later when he established his own army the mercaneries he vows to take back his kingdom along the way he meets up with alana whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell talon vows to help and after series of minor escapades eventually ends up rescuing alana brother and several other prisoners only to be captured himself in other words put on cross to be crucified fortunately he frees himself rescues alana from marrying cromwell defeats xusia and then cromwell all with his triple bladed sword during the final battle the blade breaks but talon finishes cromwell off by using hidden dagger in the blade then everything ends happily unfortunately the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds what would have been great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping bad acting and gruesomely gory bloody scenes never once does the story seem to connect together it just jumps around repeatedly this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia after telling him that he needs his help he leads the warlock out into daylight but then stabs him and sends him careening off cliff afterwards wait minute didn the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh dan which he cannot do by military force if that is the case why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him and why does he manage to take over eh dan anyway these questions are just never no never answered in the film another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana wedding to cromwell and finally at the end instead of settling down with alana he just tells her to wait and then he just rides off in addition to the extremely bloody scenes this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been great fantasy adventure even some attempts to make it exciting few fire scenes battle scenes don work it just completely fails altogether miserably the only good thing about this film is its musical score contributed by david whittaker who had an extremely short music composing career the score is boomy and adventurous powerful and billion times better than this film is my suggestion steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead if you can find it ironically though before the film credits roll there is message indicating that sequel tales of the ancient empire would follow to my relief and delight it never got into production because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office grossing only $39 million critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer all right leonard maltin rightfully called it second rate in scripting and acting and at glance film reviews called it confusing stupid unimaginative unengaging bloodfilled bore totally agree with these reviews all right and hope that this piece of #$% will be forgotten about there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer hope you get good laugh out of this review but am not laughing in fact my insults don even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time
what were they thinking nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough but do we really need an eighties film robbie hart adam sandler used to want to be rock and roll star but in 1985 he singing at weddings and having good time romantic at heart he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his high school sweetie when she leaves him waiting at the altar his tune changes to love stinks he meets waitress julia drew barrymore who is engaged to junk bonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together in fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role but there is no spark barrymore doesn seem to be able to convey anything other than pretty face with nothing behind it beauty but no attitude both characters are just there bit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show the eighties are shoved in our face references to deloreans madonna dallas ivana and donald burt and loni and miami vice get old fast the filmmakers must have realized that there wasn much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions they re not funny and it doesn work with change on all fronts accelerating more and more nostalgia appears to have great appeal but don you think we could have more than 14 years before we yearn for the past maybe we can look forward to film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be
the most interesting part of can hardly wait just happens to be not only the most human but for many of us the one part that many of us can easily relate to that is the character of denise lauren ambrose the film sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film and at one point sits down on couch and looks totally bored the film wisely holds over this moment nicely showing her alienation in the midst of large high school party almost too nicely for some members of the audience read me this is basically mirror of what going on with them watching this film we sit there wondering why we ve even bothered to see film about long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this after all this film is filled with bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which went to high school with everyone here the jock the homecoming queen the nerd and his dominions of trekkies and philes the alienated wannabe writer the school spirit girl the pothead the wigger etc etc etc and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial lame and basically as bunch of losers except for denise who rolls her eyes at everything and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks her yearbook entry something which is done for each main character quotes oscar wilde definite pointers there unfortunately the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film the film as said portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything however instead of sticking with this perhaps even going bit further with it they let this lie and actually make these characters into our heroes we follow several of them all bunch of moronic stereotypes with only shread of humanity and realism and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and or identified with them and if we did we certainly don want to revisit that state of being here quick low down it graduation and we follow bunch of seniors on the last night otherwise known as the american grafitti or to lesser extent the dazed and confused cliche the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly the latter did little bit of that and featured big outdoor keg party can hardly wait just opts for big indoor keg party and little bit of aimless driving albeit of the whining because can get girl want brand we follow many people around but mostly we trail preston ethan embry of that thing you do the alienated writer who been pining over the homcoming queen amanda the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared moment their freshman year over freaking pop tart now that she broken up with her football player boyfriend mike peter facinelli he decides to go to the party with note he written declaring his love for her in the hopes he ll build up the guts to give it to her even though he leaving for multi week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut okay the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson since that plot is incredibly lame and track record of what goes on with it wouldn be able to carry commercial let alone feature film and because it party there are some more main characters such as william charlie korsmo finally surfacing after dick tracy the nerd and his dominions who has come up with ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike who humiliated him for years but gets too caught up in drinking to do it kenny seth green the wigger who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid uh huh and denise the only exceptional character who unfortunately gets stuck in bathroom don ask with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point to point with nary bit of characterization involved after awhile ugh the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not american grafitti or dazed and confused two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers not to mention were extremely entertaining but to john hughes films of the 80s most notably sixteen candles the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion this film forgets to satirize its characters and ultimately tells story about bunch of uninteresting stereotypes and then says that it all okay we can take this film seriously nor can we take this as fun so really what good is it but will tell you some things did like liked the direction except for couple too over the top features like way too glossy jump cuts it like an oxymoron and other obscurities generally though elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement and even manage to capture an altman esque feel to their film from time to time thing with note though is too hokey to really be admirable actually did like seth green for once in about decade when he played very young woody allen in radio days his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable almost and of course lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise the one character we could have used some more of even though it would have changed the entirety of the film however the character of denise really doesn work with the film when really thought about she far too witty and realized at least for the first half to belong in this film and whenever she appears she automatically gives everything delightfully satirical tone she not just the cynic or the intellectual she just very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters she may ruin the film more but at least when she on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves well at least we ll be entertained couple other things that just don work mike character who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general the aimless bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda give me break and perhaps the one thing that just doesn work at all jenna eflman uncredited cameo as an angel just didn work but nice try basically the worst thing about this film the real reason giving this such low rating is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we do we don feel for these characters because for most of us we aren stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots the acid test for high school movies is does it at all capture the feel of what it portraying the answer for this film is no nice try though
dr alan grant sam neill jurassic park is becoming disillusioned paleontology is no longer the sexy science it once was since the ingen corporation cloned his subject matter his lectures bring people interested in his adventures on isla nubla rather than his research and funding dollars are drying up when the kirbys william macy fargo tea leoni the family man ask him to be their guide for an anniversary flyover of isla sorna the notorious site of the lost world he disdainful but once they wave their checkbook he reconsiders however the kirbys haven given dr grant their real agenda in jurassic park iii of course we the audience have been tipped off given that the film begins by showing us eric trevor morgan the patriot young boy and ben mark harelik election going for paragliding adventure off that same island that goes awry and looks like cheesy rear projection grant established back home with new right hand man billy brennan alessandro nivola love labour lost on site at dig in montana sorely lacking funds he also pays visit to old flame dr ellie sattler laura dern jurassic park now married to another with young son who calls grant the dinosaur man apparently for the sole purpose of dredging her up again for the film poorly imagined finale grant takes billy along on the kirbys trip which is really an illegal gambit to save their son that young paraglider the couple aren millionaires making grant check bogus and they re separated as well eric was with amanda new boyfriend not that that makes much sense meaning we re in for some gooey family dynamics while waiting for the dino dining the kirbys hired hands and obvious bait are threesome led by mr udesky michael jeter the gift didn anyone consider that casting michael jeter and william macy together and not having them be related was little odd as directed by joe johnston october sky jumanji spielberg only produced this one from risible script by peter buchman and the election team of alexander payne jim taylor jurassic park iii is nothing more than quickie monster flick with couple of new dinos spinosauraus which goes head to head with the rex and pteranodons the plot as it were is series of coincidences combined with extreme leaps of faith and trifecta of stupid cell phone tricks the effects are no longer new and as shot by television cinematographer shelly johnson rather murky looking at times film editing by robert dalva october sky was presumably done by machete to keep this down to 90 minute run time know of no other reason to explain the ridiculous ending which features the survivors confronting pack of raptors then being saved by the most ludicrous of logic jumps within few minutes original music by don davis just repeats john williams original themes while neill and young morgan attempt to inject some humor and humanity into the proceedings the rest of the cast are plodding unexceptional jurassic park iii will probably provide some quick entertainment for those who go into it knowing what to expect the same crowd who maybe liked the lost world jurassic park
absolute power the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood attempts to be thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff it is about as thrilling as lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence continually underestimating the audience the film gives us information we already know or dont even need details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night vision goggles in their car oddly enough the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities masterful jewel thief played by clint eastwood witnesses the murder of the wife of powerful millionaire played by marshall while robbing one of marshalls mansions he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault there through two way mirror he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay their game of love quickly turns into violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman in self defense the woman grabs letter opener and stabs the man in the elbow she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men the man he is the president of the united states of america where does the film go wrong it cannot be the acting clint eastwood ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type cast but decent performances the cinematography is sufficient wild and erratic during action sequences dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller suspense genre the fault clearly lies in the screenplay and the screenplay alone while setting up story about misuse of power about the true possessors of that power and about intrigue and double crossing it does not resolve it not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax rather the tense situations are left dangling at the end giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness an example of this is very promising and tense buildup of scene in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood the police have set up trap at small restaurant police officers are everywhere incognito of course at the same time not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives all three parties are unaware of each others presence this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood who might suspect this is trap will get himself out of this difficult position he will probably have brilliant plan involving ingenious preparations however when he arrives at the trap both hit men miss how convenient and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap the scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter the daughter blames her father for never being there for her because he was either in jail or robbing house somewhere of course their relationship takes turn for the better during the adventure and they end up happy family again it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for dramatic subplot however trying is simply not enough the second story line should be subtle original and preferably unpredictable everything this film is not how could screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced how could eastwood who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven ever believe in project like this one am sad to say that my respect for the actor director producer has diminished substantially due to this film director quentin tarantino once said can make good movie out of any bad script director clint eastwood obviously cannot

boy what great movie keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together the director of the fugitive andrew davis back again to give us another thriller and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot how could this not be blockbuster all die hard keanu reeves fans read on ol much ado about nothing plays eddie kasalivich machinist studying at the university of chicago to help pay for the rent he takes on this job making the machinery for hydrogen project being conducted by the university by happy coincidence he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics this project holds great promise taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in potential solution to the earth energy problems without the pollution cost surely nobody could have any problems with that morgan freeman is paul shannon the project sponsor he works for very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly so he murders the project leader blows up the project great but short scene here sort of like mini id4 city devastation thing and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hi tech hush hush location unfortunately our intrepid machinist and an english physicist weisz manage to get away and now follows fugitive like chase using not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script this movie is just dying for comparison with the fugitive both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesn change much guess we can really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward credit to them but we aren really given much of chance to empathise with the characters where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves character is never given the time to develop it might have been better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences which frankly get quite boring after while harrison ford was the man against the world he was alone in world where he didn know who to trust and it came across real well in chain reaction keanu reeves isn alone now that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia vulnerability and confusion we don get this we get him thinking he still in speed only now our sandra bullock has an english accent probably doesn drive bus and hardly contributes anything to the movie the producers here probably thought hey what if keanu and rachel don hit it off too well let rope in that morgan to help us out well keanu and rachel didn hit it off well on the screen and most unfortunately morgan freeman doesn help much either the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has full load of cigars in his cigar holder it not really his fault once again andrew davis just doesn take the time to build his characters someone must have convinced him that this time round cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like headless chicken the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice
this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be one of the hottest writers in hollywood he wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream 10 then added the successful know what you did last summer 10 script to his mix and also created the popular tv series dawson creek so when he asked to direct his first movie based on his first ever script written everyone and their grandma said sure go for it uhhm my question is did anyone bother reading this stupid script plot ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west mrs tingle and set to lose her scholarship to college when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story they end up tying her up and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman critique it not so much that this is bad movie than the fact that it sucks this movie is chock full of one dimensional characters contains no actual humor that was able to zone in on zero tension or thrills plot holes the size of my big ass lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie and molly ringwald vivica fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery 10 and to but unfortunately for williamson he went nowhere with the bright foundation making references to the exorcist and dr zhivago which doubt many in his target market will appreciate he also forgot about suspense with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue sure katie holmes is cute and her co star marisa coughlan did reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist worth two points out of my three on ten but how can we forgive the biggest one dimensional character in any film holmes rival in the film mrs tingle complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays and transparent romance between holmes and some long haired dude hired to be the poor man version of skeet ulrich who himself is poor man version of johnny depp all in all this movie was laughable for me provided me with no insight into anything demonstrated williamson genuine lack of directorial skills alongside juvenile script and provided helen mirren with great role to chew into unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability humanity or capacity to comprehend no hip lines no cheap thrills just dull time at the movie theater if you want to see funny teenage movie go see detroit rock city 10 and thank my drunken sorry ass in the morning little known facts about this film and its stars kevin williamson father was fisherman kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in know what you did last summer 10 he is also huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally so is dawson leery on tv dawson creek show kevin created he was once an aspiring actor in fact he even landed bit part on tv another world also williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs tingle which is also loosely based on the book killing mr griffin by the writer of know what you did last summer 10 lois duncan he has also come out and said that he is gay man helen mirren was born in london england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff she is married to director taylor hackford whose works include devil advocate 10 and an officer and gentleman 10 this film was originally titled killing mrs tingle but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident actress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called wasteland this is actor barry watson first full feature film he has played the character of seth on tv malibu shores several times
