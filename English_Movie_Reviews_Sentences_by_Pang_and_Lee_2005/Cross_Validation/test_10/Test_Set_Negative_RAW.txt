   exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . 
   a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification . 
   our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender — and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '
   analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in . 
   with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins . 
   watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost . 
   if sinise's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over . 
   a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . 
   terminally brain dead production . 
   not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . 
   there's nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever . 
   fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix . 
   it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van . 
   even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
    . . . hypnotically dull . 
   this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired . 
   it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . 
   though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
   holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp . 
   imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . the result might look like vulgar . 
   such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
   watching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy . it's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied . 
   the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel . 
   it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty . 
   unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic . 
   mild , meandering teen flick . 
   with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 
   as saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses . 
   this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
   the script by vincent r . nebrida . . . tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot . 
   only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate . 
   every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . frank mcklusky c . i . is that movie ! 
   [a] soulless , stupid sequel . . . 
   the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 
   77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 
   stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes . 
   a film that loses sight of its own story . 
   it's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful . 
   alternately frustrating and rewarding . 
   it's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure . 
   despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this . 
   kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
   'yes , that's right : it's forrest gump , angel of death . '
    . . . a bland murder-on-campus yawner . 
   in the book-on-tape market , the film of " the kid stays in the picture " would be an abridged edition
   a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater . 
   i've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama . 
   brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors . . . by shoving them into every clichéd white-trash situation imaginable . 
   at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot . 
   empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either . 
   there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties . 
   you leave feeling like you've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing . 
    . . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises . 
   what started out as a taut contest of wills between bacon and theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence . 
   obvious
   the inevitable double- and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how john malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line . 
   a fifty car pileup of cliches . 
   a rather tired exercise in nostalgia . 
   some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments . 
   despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow , the weight of water is oppressively heavy . 
   they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn . they were right . 
   nohe has made a decent 'intro' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant . 
   stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind . 
   partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . 
   the talk-heavy film plays like one of robert altman's lesser works . 
   as happily glib and vicious as its characters . 
   it's easy to love robin tunney -- she's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices . 
   an unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title . 
   a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 
   the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged . 
   like a soft drink that's been sitting open too long : it's too much syrup and not enough fizz . 
   as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . 
   witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic . 
   as plain and pedestrian as catsup--
   guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . some of the characters die and others don't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares . 
   a bit too eager to please . 
   despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , harry potter and the chamber of secrets finds a way to make j . k . rowling's marvelous series into a deadly bore . 
   it's just not very smart . 
   the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments . 
   it's not a bad premise , just a bad movie . 
   crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls . 
   sayles . . . once again strands his superb performers in the same old story . 
    . . . the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation . there's already been too many of these films . . . 
   when you resurrect a dead man , hard copy should come a-knocking , no ? 
   one of these days hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations . 
   drowning's too good for this sucker . 
   whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black . 
   if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $99 bargain-basement special . 
   every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming .

   [davis] wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters . 
   i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year . 
   mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline . 
   reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that . 
   'christian bale's quinn [is] a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '
   the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to be having a collective heart attack . 
   you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . 
   formulaic to the 51st power , more like . 
   cinematic poo . 
   in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little . 
   will give many ministers and bible-study groups hours of material to discuss . but mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted . 
   an unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity . 
   the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not . 
   it made me feel unclean , and i'm the guy who liked there's something about mary and both american pie movies . oh , and booty call . 
   an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance . 
   unless you're a fanatic , the best advice is : 'scooby' don't . 
   this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic . 
   scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company . 
   not counting a few gross-out comedies i've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes . 
   an average b-movie with no aspirations to be anything more . 
   less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie . 
   a film that suffers because of its many excesses . 
   a dreary movie . 
   it's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit . 
   contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster . 
   the only question . . . is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . average , at best , i'm afraid . 
   it's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary . 
   pompous and garbled . 
   i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes . 
   a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming . 
   the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time . 
   a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points . 
   'synthetic' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree . 
   it concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between chan and hewitt . 
   shallow , noisy and pretentious . 
   granddad of le nouvelle vague , jean-luc godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek . 
   the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey . . . [it] comes off like a hallmark commercial . 
   malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
   diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
   utter mush . . . conceited pap . 
   shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was . 
   if religious films aren't your bailiwick , stay away . otherwise , this could be a passable date film . 
   the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
   just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller . 
   not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since the bad news bears has been ? -- but certainly hard to hate . 
   largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . 
   so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it . 
   a plodding teen remake that's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists . 
   the movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man . 
   cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility . 
   gere gives a good performance in a film that doesn't merit it . 
   the script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material . 
   it's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt . 
   a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end . 
   elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level . 
   i'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i don't see the point . it's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed . 
   the film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture . 
   video games are more involving than this mess . 
   a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making . 
   the adventure doesn't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 . 
   solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that soderbergh's best films , " erin brockovich , " " out of sight " and " ocean's eleven , " never were . 
   more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat . 
   affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into , a role that ford effortlessly filled with authority . 
   what might have been acceptable on the printed page of iles' book does not translate well to the screen . 
   a dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires . 
   cassavetes thinks he's making dog day afternoon with a cause , but all he's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon . 
   buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . 
   [e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism . 
    " roger michell ( " notting hill " ) directs a morality thriller . " 
   there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame . 
   the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did . 
    it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . 
   the lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it . 
   i can't recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless . 
   corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in . 
   if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . 
   though catch me if you can isn't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie . 
   a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba . 
   it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death . 
   how do you spell cliché ? 
   this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience . 
   the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows . 
   care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters . 
   a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness . 
   it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they're being streamed over a 28k modem . 
   this is nothing but familiar territory . 
   scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence . it's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job . 
   by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie . 
   too often , the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance . 
   what's next ? the porky's revenge : ultimate edition ? 
   dilbert without the right-on satiric humor . 
   do not see this film . 
   i'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here . 
   it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) . 
   what the director can&#8217 ; t do is make either of val kilmer&#8217 ; s two personas interesting or worth caring about . 
   it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . 
   it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation . 
   but the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative . 
   harrison's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all . 
   the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second . 
    " the time machine " is a movie that has no interest in itself . it doesn't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor…it's just plain bored . 
   i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
   plays like a volatile and overlong w magazine fashion spread . 
   this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . there can be no other explanation . hilariously inept and ridiculous . 
   characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs . 
   visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it . 
   it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes . 
   the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant . 
   burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . 
   an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce . 
   professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller . 
   nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle . 
   at once half-baked and overheated . 
   i still can't relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough . 
   the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
   no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars . 
   tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple — he's understated and sardonic , she's appealingly manic and energetic . both deserve better . 
   sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you . 
   does paint some memorable images . . . , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
   for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . 
   whereas last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it . 
   a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j . m . barrie's peter pan . 
   is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? i don't think so . nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me . 
   in the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director joe carnahan . 
   it's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt . 
   the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life . 
   the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult . 
   long time dead ? not nearly long enough . 
   an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes . 
   trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive . 
   it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . 
   scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
   prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this english trifle . 
   this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . 
   comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . 
   the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue . 
    . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves . 
   another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh . 
   moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance . 
   in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context . 
    . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . 
   it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile . 
   when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper . 
   the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin . 
   i hated every minute of it . 
   a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within . 
   it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . 
   for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies . 
   it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
   characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better . 
   the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun – toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout . 
   it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through . 
   there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject . 
   overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper . 
   i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation . 
    . . . [a] strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense . 
   a sour , nasty offering . 
   william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot . . . 
   like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten . 
   where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
   wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn . 
   this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack . 
   kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world . 
   an awful snooze . 
   wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together
   dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . 
   all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
   it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world . 
   flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year's eve drunk sporting a paper party hat . 
   a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes . 
   a little too pat for its own good . 
   so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something . 
   the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere . 
   rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
    " juwanna mann ? " no thanks . wewannour money back , actually . 
   shallow . 
   begins as a promising meditation on one of america's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt . 
   in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis . 
   with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path . 
   falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny . 
   feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
   a bravura exercise in emptiness . 
   first good , then bothersome . excellent acting and direction . 
   even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame . 
   despite its title , amy's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one . 
   to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable . 
   newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept – a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 
   a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men . 
   as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up . 
   ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
   if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead . 
   the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs . 
   thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired . 
   a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through . 
   the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction . 
   though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best . 
   the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off . 
   much of what is meant to be 'inspirational' and 'uplifting' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing [the movie's] mindset . 
   well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels . 
   instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started . 
   this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience . 
   the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky . 
   for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero . 
   frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music . 
   a very average science fiction film . 
   undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters . 
   screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster . 
   this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life . 
   the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
   has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act . 
   just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else . 
   as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . 
   the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover . 
   creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller . 
   city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . 
   barely goes beyond comic book status . 
   maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul " full frontal " seems , well , contrived . 
   [morgan] , judd and franklin can't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism . 
   murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie -of-the-week films clumsily stuck together . 
   though certainly original in form , altar boys requires a taste for swamp thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score . 
   there's not enough to sustain the comedy . 
   like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them . 
   suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum . punish the vehicle to adore the star . 
   strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery . 
   the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable naïveté and arbitrary flashbacks . 
   it's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable . 
   with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful . 
   bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script . 
   godard uses his characters -- if that's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks . 
   an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen . 
   the people in abc africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras . 
   call me a cynic , but there's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message . 
   [evans is] a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie . 
   you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story . 
   a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel . 
   i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort . 
   who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '
   ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film . 
   for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
   unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
   this story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 
   the concept behind kung pow : enter the fist is hilarious . it's too bad nothing else is . 
   director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel . 
   a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling . 
   that frenetic spectacle [on the tv show] has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the girls' big-screen blowout . 
   sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 
   there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time . 
   the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
   after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying . 
   one big blustery movie where nothing really happens . when it comes out on video , then it's the perfect cure for insomnia . 
   this is an action movie with an action icon who's been all but decommissioned . 
   much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date . 
   there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film . 
   unofficially , national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house . officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny . 
   a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse . 
   time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable . 
   dramatically lackluster . 
   this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
   a timid , soggy near miss . 
   to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
   a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
   the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card . 
   lazily directed by charles stone iii . . . from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis . 
   i can't remember the last time i saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there's only one problem…it's supposed to be a drama . 
   tom shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing adams , but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it . 
   unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers . 
   a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece . 
   jonah is only so-so . . . the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it . 
   the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment . 
   a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged . 
   are monsters born , or made ? 
   the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours . 
   it's depressing to see how far herzog has fallen . 
   millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . 
   perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
   narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself . 
   an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike . 
   one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time . 
   they threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans . 
   its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare . 
   a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 
   though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract . 
   rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along . 
   scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick . 
   at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 
   the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own . 
   too clumsy in key moments . . . to make a big splash . 
   it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense . 
   a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
   the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 
   the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
   in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
   starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés . 
   one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation . 
   the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break . 
   the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster . 
   the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . 
   the story has little wit and no surprises . 
   a quaint , romanticized rendering . 
   what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
   a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work . 
   squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare . 
   rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian . 
   a horrible , 99-minute stink bomb . 
   the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil . 
   the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not . 
   becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
   rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical . 
   the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing . 
   plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
   i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 
   nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley's breasts -- is authentic . 
   strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression . 
   we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments . 
   like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 
   i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great . . . i'm not , and then i realized that i just didn't care . 
   tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
   zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . 
   lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 
   the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
   nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
   it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 
   a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
   it's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind . 
   a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp . 
   as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 
   they're going through the motions , but the zip is gone . 
   the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it's far too sentimental . 
   these are textbook lives of quiet desperation . 
   it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes . 
   a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that . 
   though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful . 
   costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
   boring and meandering . 
   neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered . 
   the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material . 
   the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project . 
   caso você sinta necessidade de sair da sala antes do término da projeção , não se preocupe : ninguém lhe enviará penas simbolizando covardia . 
   chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly . 
   it's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name . 
   a lame comedy . 
   can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
   often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time is it there ? into how long is this movie ? 
   it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . 
   the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready . 
   this ludicrous film is predictable at every turn . 
   bogs down badly as we absorb jia's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance . 
   far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 
   the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 
   has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
   comes across as a fairly weak retooling . 
   the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . 
   watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen . 
   it's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive . 
   a meatballs for the bare-midriff generation . 
   the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . 
   anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy . 
   plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
   new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
   each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . 
   the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel isn't the actor to save it . 
   showtime isn't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again . 
   what's the most positive thing that can be said about the new rob schneider vehicle ? well , it's not as pathetic as the animal . 
   the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts . 
   ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna . 
   the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . 
   an opportunity missed . 
   the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years . 
   even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids . . . getting . . . very . . . heavy . . . 
   boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . 
   yo , it's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo . 
   it's crap on a leash--far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante's similarly styled gremlins . 
   it's not too fast and not too slow . it's not too racy and it's not too offensive . it's not too much of anything . 
   family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition&#133 ; whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance . 
   grant isn't cary and bullock isn't katherine . 
   van wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest . 
   do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ? 
   so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie . 
   this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own . 
   the script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of 'hypertime' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for spy kids . 
   some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny . 
   show me the mugging . 
   the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting . 
   essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . . 
   director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning . 
   there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them . 
   from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out . 
   there's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
   fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess . 
   sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate jim carrey who doesn't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb . 
   was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? 
   i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . 
   in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . 
   green ruins every single scene he's in , and the film , while it's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that . 
   resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
   an empty , purposeless exercise . 
   hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud . 
   a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration . 
   fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , isn't really one of resources . 
   the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing . 
   no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina . 
   once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea isn't funny . 
   done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment . 
   according to wendigo , 'nature' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves . 
   i walked away not really know who " they " were , what " they " looked like . why " they " were here and what " they " wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . 
   the country bears wastes an exceptionally good idea . but the movie that doesn't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
   an ugly , revolting movie . 
   directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
   the beautiful , unusual music is this film's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep . 
   it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
   why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? 
    . . . hopefully it'll be at the dollar theatres by the time christmas rolls around . wait to see it then . 
   this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
   the threat implied in the title pokémon 4ever is terrifying – like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming . 
   the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries . 
   throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
   festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 
   rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic . 
   report card : doesn't live up to the exalted tagline - there's definite room for improvement . doesn't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) . 
    . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags . 
   earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
   ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
   we started to wonder if … some unpaid intern had just typed 'chris rock , ' 'anthony hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some univac-like script machine . 
   more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat . 
   [a] boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain . 
   the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low . 
   some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
   it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned . 
   stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 
   the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
   a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust . 
   the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . 
   the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
   is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ? 
   it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . 
   unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . 
   spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning . 
   some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
   [hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through . 
   a real snooze . 
   the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them . 
   you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal . 
   it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .
