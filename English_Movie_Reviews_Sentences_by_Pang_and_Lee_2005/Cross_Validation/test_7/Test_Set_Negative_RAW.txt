   watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence .

   i got a headache watching this meaningless downer . 
   it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that . 
   this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics .

   hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty . 
   not only unfunny , but downright repellent . 
   has a long and clunky ending . . . which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience's awkward silence
   uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . 
   the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain . 
   holden caulfield did it better . 
   jacquot's rendering of puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera . in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically . 
   if only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .

   a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .

   i don't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but don't treat me like a fool . 
    . . . although this idea is " new " the results are tired . 
   i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long . 
   don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk . 
   the only entertainment you'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles – several of them . 
   lástima por schwarzenegger , pero es hora de que deje la estafeta a las nuevas generaciones .

   the film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go . 
   more whiny downer than corruscating commentary .

   directed in a paint-by-numbers manner . 
   it's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .

   at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave . 
   denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others . 
   the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him . 
   the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take . 
   deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness . 
   like the chelsea's denizens . . . burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste . 
   it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived . 
   it showcases carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff . 
   if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , don't settle for this imposter . 
   a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring . 
   there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
   whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy . 
   as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear . 
   there's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television .

   most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots . this one's weaker than most . 
   if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan . 
   unwieldy contraption .

   the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
    . . . instead go rent " shakes the clown " , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance .

   it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull . 
   director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person . 
   egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .

   there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false . 
   director clare kilner's debut is never as daft as it should have been . 
   the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes . 
   with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer/director/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry .

   beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
   the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . 
   taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore . but as a movie , it's a humorless , disjointed mess .
