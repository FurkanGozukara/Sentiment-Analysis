   while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .

   narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess . 
   it's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding .

   with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake . 
   if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash . 
   the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing . 
   the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox . 
   an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it . 
   this movie . . . doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is . 
   one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history . 
   a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family . 
   with the exception of mccoist , the players don't have a clue on the park . the acting isn't much better . 
   [p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 
   one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou . 
   to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough . 
   the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing . 
   the pool drowned me in boredom . 
   as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . 
   this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
    . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers . 
   it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd . 
   and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy ! 
   a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation . 
   a high-minded snoozer . 
   all movie long , city by the sea swings from one approach to the other , but in the end , it stays in formula -- which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast . 
   the film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work . 
   yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero . but fans of the show should not consider this a diss . consider it 'perfection . '

   it's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy lil' bow wow .

   banal and predictable . 
   these two are generating about as much chemistry as an iraqi factory poised to receive a un inspector . 
   just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation . 
   a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor .

   one of the most incoherent features in recent memory . 
   low rent from frame one .

   no amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie's lack of ideas . 
   below is well below expectations . 
   unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg . 
   a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor . 
   with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd . 
   the images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where whitaker's misfit artist is concerned . 
   the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack . 
   human nature , in short , isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart . 
   [sam's] self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining . 
   it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish . 
   the overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of " 7th heaven . " 
   this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie . 
   there's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long . 
   seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof . 
   the name says it all . jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set . 
   glizty but formulaic and silly . . . cagney's 'top of the world' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel . 
   serving sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time . 
   a really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness . 
   not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at . 
   i know we're not supposed to take it seriously , but i can't shake the thought that undercover brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary . 
   for all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs . spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian . 
   kapur's contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie that works against itself . 
   in trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh .

   watching queen of the damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in .

   several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante . 
   it's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain . 
   a frustrating 'tweener' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls . 
   there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements don't gel . 
   the innocence of holiday cheer ain't what it used to be . 
   consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire . 
   feels at times like a giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place . 
   this heist flick about young brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of vin diesel , seth green and barry pepper . it should have stayed there . 
   it's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable . 
   director carl franklin , so crisp and economical in one false move , bogs down in genre cliches here . 
   while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket . 
   being unique doesn't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke . 
   shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies . 
   meanders between its powerful moments . 
   a lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor . 
   little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick . 
   it's probably not easy to make such a worthless film . . . 
   at the one-hour mark , herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion . 
   the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled . 
   if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother . 
   less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession . 
   it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
   offers absolutely nothing i hadn't already seen . 
   first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people . 
   simply doesn't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time . 
   an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas . 
   what's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy . 
   there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser . 
   the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film . 
   for single digits kidlets stuart little 2 is still a no brainer . if you're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you'll need a stronger stomach than us . 
   we hate [madonna] within the film's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground . 
   apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap . 
   a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being . 
   love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly wasn't feeling any of it . 
   while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey . 
   the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight . 
    . . . grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces . 
   there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance . 
   the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers . 
   it gets old quickly . watch barbershop again if you're in need of a cube fix--this isn't worth sitting through . 
   criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama . 
   a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material . 
   completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . 
   doesn't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez . 
   so earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script . 
   it's splash without the jokes . 
   a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore . 
   normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable . 
   an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging . 
   brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . 
   gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing . 
   hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like . . . but overall the halloween series has lost its edge . 
   the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career . 
   once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window . 
   the best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding . quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance . 
   it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . 
   simply a re-hash of the other seven films . 
   the comedy is nonexistent . 
   it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame . 
   it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it . 
   one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters . 
    . . . will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks . after seeing the film , i can tell you that there's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it . 
   it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor . 
   the film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface . 
    . . . overly melodramatic . . . 
   patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary . 
   it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull . 
   ms . phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either esther's initial anomie or her eventual awakening . 
   a clich√©d and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men . 
   one suspects that craven endorses they simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison . 
   includes too much obvious padding . 
   who are 'they' ? well , they're 'they' . they're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid . they exist for hushed lines like " they're back ! " , " they're out there ! " and " they're coming ! " 
   murder by numbers just doesn't add up . 
    . . . a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional . 
   the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure . 
   a movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'empowerment . '
   moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact . 
   this thing works on no level whatsoever for me . 
   no telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie . 
   his comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level . 
   the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie . . . is that he obviously doesn't have his heart in it . 
   no way i can believe this load of junk . 
   full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
   just one bad idea after another . 
   a by-the-numbers effort that won't do much to enhance the franchise . 
   overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube . 
   sluggish , tonally uneven . 
   hey arnold ! the movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing . 
   we haven't seen such hilarity since say it isn't so ! 
   so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie . 
   it's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show . 
   sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
   well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull . 
   k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension . 
   whaley's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting . 
   if it's seldom boring , well , it's also rarely coherent . 
   the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment . 
   despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end . 
   minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report . 
   in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey . 
   a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction . 
   a coarse and stupid gross-out . 
   there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route . 
   an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow . 
   it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . 
   its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks . 
   for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
   miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness . 
   it's slow -- very , very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype . 
   feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot . 
   scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas . 
   while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target . 
   has all the depth of a wading pool . 
   a noble failure . 
   it's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel . 
   better to just call it abc kiarostami . for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery . 
   it's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination . 
   due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality . 
   nonsensical , dull " cyber-horror " flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting . 
   a great ensemble cast can't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar . 
   sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwii-era mississippi delta undermine this adaptation . 
   every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn . 
   the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental . 
   one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution . 
   serving sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs . 
   stale , futile scenario . 
   another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . 
   though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . 
   something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously . 
   historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material . 
   i'm just too bored to care . 
   a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers . 
   shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme . 
   the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
   to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
   this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions . 
   the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden . 
   stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd . 
   shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 
   the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
   this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd . 
   i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr . holland's class for the music , or to robin williams's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve . 
   it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part . 
   this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself . 
   arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie . 
   most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future . 
   lame , haphazard teen comedy . 
   it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us . 
   despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america's sweetheart . 
   for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer . 
   the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet . 
   a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half . 
   much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie . 
   it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling . " interview " loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into . 
   if you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at britney spears' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch . 
   sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle . 
   you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing . 
   just plain silly . 
   began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course . 
   mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor . 
   although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours . 
   scotland , pa . blurs the line between black comedy and black hole . 
   too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through . 
   better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine . 
   the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun . 
   so stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly . 
   let's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home . 
   a journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking . 
   the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone . 
   the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached . 
   how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $100 million on this ? 
   [plays] in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy . 
   disjointed parody . 
   despite the premise of a good story . . . it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles . 
   it's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--i'm prepared to call it a draw . 
   although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke . 
   ‚Ä¶a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason . 
   without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it's a bad , embarrassing movie . 
   the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven . 
   too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes . 
   the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them . 
   about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
   apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths . marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess . 
   a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags . 
   the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable . 
   este √© apenas mais um ( longo ) epis√≥dio do programa da mtv . a √∫nica diferen√ßa √© que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas . 
   an awkward and indigestible movie . 
   a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick . 
   plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights . 
   another rent installment for the ian fleming estate . 
   has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags . 
   this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay . 
   the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though . 
   outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride . 
   the movie gets muted and routine . 
   a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
   it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes . 
   stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition ‚Äì wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text ‚Äì when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type . 
   how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us . 
   those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight . 
   preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . 
   there's something deeply creepy about never again , a new arrow in schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes . 
   a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
   the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . 
   i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
   fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense . 
   the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough . 
   everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 
   not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey . 
   i wish i could say " thank god it's friday " , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . 
   consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .

   'how many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
   one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating . 
   showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant " if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny " syndrome . 
   there aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv .

   if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
   parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde's still-contemporary play . 
   anemic , pretentious . 
   the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession . 
   the story . . . is moldy and obvious . 
   without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos . 
   with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv's defunct cleopatra 2525 . 
   enough similarities to gymkata and howie long's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs . 
   if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins . 
   the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly‚Ä¶ alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . 
   a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not . 
   distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register . 
   a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge . 
   what's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that's tv sitcom material at best . 
   like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions . 
   will anyone who isn't a fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video ? 
   true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 
   a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches . 
   just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name . 
   while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it doesn't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde's wit and the actors' performances . 
   this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable .

   'sophisticated' viewers who refuse to admit that they don't like it will likely call it 'challenging' to their fellow sophisticates . 
   when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence . 
   a serious movie with serious ideas . but seriously , folks , it doesn't work . 
   there's nothing exactly wrong here , but there's not nearly enough that's right . 
   [a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . . 
   benigni's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow . 
   the material and the production itself are little more than routine . 
   a wordy wisp of a comedy . 
   a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense . 
   it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective . 
   mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest the mummy returns . 
   the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 
   vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much . 
   a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set . 
   'butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach . 
   so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
   no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised . 
   there's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects . 
   no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film .

   a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather . 
   a pretentious mess . 
   with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted . 
   these characters become wearisome . 
   after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
   loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 
   blue crush is as predictable as the tides . . . . the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies . 
   a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats . 
   nothing about this movie works . 
   lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension . 
   this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens . . . or if it were subtler . . . or if it had a sense of humor . 
   this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . 
   a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . '
   this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it . 
   a half-assed film . 
   cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts . 
   it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
   nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .

   a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
   russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers's title-bout features . 
   jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked . 
   a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss . 
   a preposterous , prurient whodunit . 
   according to the script , grant and bullock's characters are made for each other . but you'd never guess that from the performances . 
   an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension . 
   this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
   mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry . 
   told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject . 
   if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it . 
   carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '

   the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest . 
   basically , it's pretty but dumb . 
   if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . 
   little more than a well-mounted history lesson . 
   it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .

   there is nothing redeeming about this movie . 
   a dreary indulgence . 
   flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
   [denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product . 
   writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags . 
   cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
   one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
   it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . 
   would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 
   one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 
   solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
   most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .

   by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .

   there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
   when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
   like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable . 
   when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks . 
   as original and insightful as last week's episode of behind the music . 
   plays like john le carr√© with a couple of burnt-out cylinders . 
   the christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it

   meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull . 
   an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten . 
   it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
   not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired . 
   an awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work . 
   the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold . 
   mctiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious . 
   an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy . 
   hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares . 
   it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion . 
   the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
   full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 
   there isn't one moment in the film that surprises or delights . 
   most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence . 
   smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong . . . it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera . 
   its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
   a sugar-coated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks . 
   fairly run-of-the-mill . 
   it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . 
   a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 
   julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent . 
   all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . 
   a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 
   unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
   it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest -‚Äì audience sadism -- is evaded completely . 
   an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 
   for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either . 
   just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
   sweet home alabama certainly won't be remembered as one of [witherspoon's] better films . 
   handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked souffl√© . 
   a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind . 
   what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean .

   any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy's sledgehammer sap . 
   what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?

   all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . 
    . . . the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy . 
   one long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before . 
   the film's most improbable feat ? it didn't go straight to video . 
   the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses ‚Äì and ours ‚Äì and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home . 
   the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
   the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
   it's just rather leaden and dull . 
   when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
   i've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra's classic . . . 
   and people make fun of me for liking showgirls</> .

   the last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others' affections . 
   to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there's no indication that he's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit . 
   the most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill . 
   it goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .

   more precious than perspicacious
   an intriguing near-miss . 
   a sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer . 
   all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise . 
   ah-nuld's action hero days might be over . 
   davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that doesn't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine . 
   a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either . 
   while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity . 
   allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap . 
   a wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily .

   it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
   the romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be . 
   adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some . 
   to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . . 
   predictably melodramatic . 
   too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets . 
   solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .

   the hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork . 
   the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due . 
   the venezuelans say things like " si , pretty much " and " por favor , go home " when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of " dragonfly . "
