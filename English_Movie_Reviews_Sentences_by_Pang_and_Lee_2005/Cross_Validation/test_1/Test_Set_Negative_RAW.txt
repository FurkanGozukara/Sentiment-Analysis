   [garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation . 
   unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script . 
   interesting , but not compelling . 
   the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . 
   it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action . 
   please , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film . 
   too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one . 
   sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house . 
   skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd . 
   the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag . 
   there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted . 
   it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
   the movie is a mess from start to finish . 
   j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl . 
   as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink . 
   an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either . 
   by the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing . 
   director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . 
   it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . 
   fear permeates the whole of stortelling , todd solondz' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique . 
   such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . 
   bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly . 
   star trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy . 
   'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '
   gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance . 
   a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special . 
   during the tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time , there isn't one true 'chan moment' . 
   an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental . 
   unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . 
   this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness . 
   watching the powerpuff girls movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures . 
   to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 
   though its atmosphere is intriguing . . . the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression . 
   there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 
   there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . 
   the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements . 
   oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between . 
   as an entertainment destination for the general public , kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness . 
   wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time . 
   bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness . 
   throw smoochy from the train ! 
   few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering barry's terrific performance . 
   the movie is as padded as allen's jelly belly . 
   a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late . 
   cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation ( career - kids = misery ) in tiresome romantic-comedy duds . 
   mr . soderbergh's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious . 
   it makes me feel weird / thinking about all the bad things in the world / like puppies with broken legs / and butterflies that die / and movies starring pop queens
   a humorless journey into a philosophical void . 
   responsável direto pelo fracasso 'artístico' de doce lar , o roteirista c . jay cox não consegue sequer aproveitar os pouquíssimos momentos em que escapa da mediocridade . 
   the issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments , that it's impossible to care . 
   gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh . 
   soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable . 
   the town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial . 
   as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer . as the mediterranean sparkles , 'swept away' sinks . 
   jonathan parker's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films . 
   it's the type of stunt the academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film . 
   sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and judaism back at least 50 . 
   weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he doesn't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car . 
   a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels . 
   so devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it cannot even be dubbed hedonistic . 
   a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her . 
   everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull . 
   as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
   possibly not since grumpy old men have i heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another . 
   bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them . 
   a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum . 
   a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man's quest to find an old flame . 
   one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
   in the end , the weight of water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you'd expect to see on showtime's 'red shoe diaries . '
   is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ? 
   too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot . 
   the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada . 
   too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script . 
   much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad . 
   just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence . . . lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm . 
   all the movie's narrative gymnastics can't disguise the fact that it's inauthentic at its core and that its story just isn't worth telling . 
   this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . 
   crudup's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families . 
   the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
   never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance . 
   new ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is . 
   when cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy giannini , madonna gives her best performance since abel ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game . 
   i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject . 
   no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make . 
   howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a buñuel retrospective . 
   i can't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops . 
   this overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary . hmmm…might i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ? 
   mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor . 
   for all its brilliant touches , dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion . 
   this is a film living far too much in its own head . 
   to be influenced chiefly by humanity's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for god's sake ! -- is a crime that should be punishable by chainsaw . 
   as we have come to learn -- as many times as we have fingers to count on -- jason is a killer who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit . ' the filmmakers might want to look it up . 
   frankly , it's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there's plenty to offend everyone . . . 
   the movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious . 
   there's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms isn't it . 
   toward the end sum of all fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick . 
   this thing is just garbage . 
   an empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance . 
   a backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship . 
   pure of intention and passably diverting , his secret life is light , innocuous and unremarkable . 
   [t]oo many of these gross out scenes . . . 
   the big ending surprise almost saves the movie . it's too bad that the rest isn't more compelling . 
   has no reason to exist , other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents . 
   constantly slips from the grasp of its maker . 
   not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you'll have a good time with this one too . 
   a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches . 
   rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them . 
   howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they're often undone by howard's self-conscious attempts to find a 'literary' filmmaking style to match his subject . 
   it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
   the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat . 
   queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame . 
   not once does it come close to being exciting . 
   it plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness . 
   don't even bother to rent this on video . 
   too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient . 
   depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it's being . 
   the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie . 
   mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
   a moving picture that does not move . 
   ruh-roh ! romething's really wrong with this ricture ! 
    . . . an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler . 
   who , exactly , is fighting whom here ? ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze . 
   the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie . 
   comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions . . . feel silly rather than plausible . 
   traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clichés that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill . 
   the impulses that produced this project . . . are commendable , but the results are uneven . 
   a well-acted movie that simply doesn't gel . 
   outside of burger's desire to make some kind of film , it's really unclear why this project was undertaken
   it's one long bore . 
   it's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking . 
   it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland . 
   horrible
   it's super- violent , super-serious and super-stupid . 
   it's better than the phantom menace . but unless you're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it isn't much fun . 
   though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted . 
   like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six . 
   dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 
   it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations . 
   stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about . 
   super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers . 
   made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because [solondz's] cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt . 
   believability wasn't one of the film's virtues . 
   can't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ? try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde . 
   one of the more glaring signs of this movie's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms . spears . 
   ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills . ignore the reputation , and ignore the film . 
   it's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by elizabeth hurley in a bathing suit . 
   worth seeing once , but its charm quickly fades . 
   your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make . 
   i'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing's happening , or the part where something's happening , but it's stupid . 
   shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors . . . 
   downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message . 
   they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
   comedy troupe broken lizard's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot . 
   'all in all , reign of fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '
   the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive . 
   a mess . the screenplay does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen . 
   before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg's adaptation of mary gaitskill's harrowing short story . . . is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience . 
   you can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer . thumbs down . 
    . . . they missed the boat . 
   cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time . 
   since the movie is based on a nicholas sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things . 
   full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , kung pow ! is the kind of movie that's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low . 
   if there's one thing this world needs less of , it's movies about college that are written and directed by people who couldn't pass an entrance exam . 
   thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters . mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way . 
   it believes it's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile . 
   it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism . 
   the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
   should have been someone else-
   the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner . 
   though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama . 
   once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back . 
   the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque . 
   while it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold . 
   to call the other side of heaven " appalling " would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be . 
   while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these . 
   harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment . 
   star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before . wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty . 
   not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through . 
   the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation . 
   given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done . 
   even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . 
   there's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging . 
   more maudlin than sharp . 
   this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . 
   it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction . 
    . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
   an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story . 
    . . . the movie is just a plain old monster . 
   there's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it . 
    . . . think of it as american pie on valium . 
   puportedly " based on true events , " a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is " based on a true story " with a straight face . 
   with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap . 
   this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well . 
   a puzzling experience . 
   the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second . 
   let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly " inspired " was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen . 
   there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill . 
   it can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy . 
   with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . 
   makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
   the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves . 
   verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies . 
   skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt . 
   even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping . 
   it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . 
   is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? 
   the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . 
   this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
   it doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than " confessions of a dangerous mind . " 
   audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones .

   imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs .

   guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things . she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .

   a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes . 
   little more than a frothy vanity project . 
   ihops don't pile on this much syrup . 
   with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you don't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door . 
    . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 
   could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence .

   the thrill is ( long ) gone . 
   being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
   great story , bad idea for a movie .

   writhing under dialogue like 'you're from two different worlds' and 'tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability . 
   schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad . 
   when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart . 
   if we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get . 
   all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters . 
   it's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor . 
   there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them . 
   i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief . 
   you've already seen heartbreak if you've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard . even the unwatchable soapdish is more original .

   a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan . 
   the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected . 
   the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious . 
   anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going .

   the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it . 
   serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .

   for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . 
   while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that . 
   calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls . 
   this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
   bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description . 
   [two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now .

   national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
   overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
   its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops . 
   the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing . 
   has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . 
   it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut . 
   an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality .

   disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material . 
   if you're not the target demographic . . . this movie is one long chick-flick slog . 
    . . . pitiful , slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one . 
   the dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically . 
   evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention . 
   the screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines . 
   almost as offensive as " freddy got fingered . " 
   it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 
   a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life . 
   originality is sorely lacking . 
   the plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story . but while the highly predictable narrative falls short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold . 
   just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love .

   the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
   it drowns in sap . 
   the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece . 
   broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .

   la cinta comienza intentando ser un drama , rápidamente se transforma en una comedia y termina por ser una parodia absolutamente predecible
   the pairing does sound promising in theory . . . but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners . 
   even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
   there's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side . 
   while some of the camera work is interesting , the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .

   observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom . 
   far too clever by half , howard's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another . 
   fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers . 
   no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through . 
   it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress . 
   the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
   everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had .

   the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters . 
   i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it . 
   this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy .

   contrived pastiche of caper clichés .

   sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes . 
   wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted . 
   madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose . 
   apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 
   the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments . 
   fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 
   an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie . 
   just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny . 
   we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat . 
   with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp . 
   slap me , i saw this movie . 
   resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you're likely to see all year . 
   so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat . 
   what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is ! 
   as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy . 
   a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight . 
   a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks . 
   the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness . 
   there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew . 
   only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience . 
   what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
   the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 
   its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life . 
   it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
   eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good . 
   the film has [its] moments , but they are few and far between . 
   deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits . 
   wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own . 
   it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge . 
   in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . 
   aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
   for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
   for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype . 
   tends to plod . 
   no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population . 
   it is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied . 
   tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span . 
   after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned . but no . 
   ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok . 
   this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows . 
   exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera . . . more salacious telenovela than serious drama . 
   it's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate . 
   high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd . 
   set in a 1986 harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in new york . 
   the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
   the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
   writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon . 
   dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation . 
   i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 
   we get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle . 
   a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film . 
   high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
   after an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be . 
   if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you're far better served by the source material . 
   it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 
   like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
   a ragbag of cliches . 
   even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , sorority boys is a bowser . 
   weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 
   the secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again . 
   the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
   more a gunfest than a rock concert . 
   degenerates into hogwash . 
   the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile . 
   disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel . 
   how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [françois and michèle's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them . 
   collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence . 
   attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 
   mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative . 
   a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 
   mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money . 
   meandering and confusing . 
   there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 
   hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . 
    " sorority boys " was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 
   been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better . 
   sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . 
   barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality . 
   while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
   with all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen . . . his secret life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles . 
   meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 
   whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors . 
   as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . 
   the actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect . the characters never change . 
   the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment . 
   mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear . 
   shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
   the locale . . . remains far more interesting than the story at hand . 
   aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane . 
   the title , alone , should scare any sane person away . 
   low comedy doesn't come much lower . 
   amazingly lame . 
   like most of jaglom's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand . 
   whether quitting will prove absorbing to american audiences is debatable . 
   the film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence . 
   this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship . 
   it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . i can't . 
   one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . 
   such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution . 
   [allen's] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be . 
   this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month's end , is tepid and tedious . 
   a clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film . . . 
   [a] poorly executed comedy . 
   not only does leblanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes . 
   'in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
   while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think . 
   sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its élan , humor , bile , and irony . 
   the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired . 
   it's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick . 
   snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good . 
   it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success . 
   this picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc's , despite a few whopping shootouts . 
   a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
   tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 
   ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on . 
    sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 
    . . . feels as if ( there's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 
   flat , misguided comedy . 
   a porn film without the sex scenes . 
   though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 
   one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 
   in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz . 
   an encouraging effort from mccrudden
   if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately , you still have that option . 
   supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
   a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally . 
   with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . 
    . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
   watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff . 
   my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack . 
   while hoffman's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere . 
   the film is all over the place , really . it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . 
   all mood and no movie . 
   at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day . 
   the whole talking-animal thing is grisly . 
   too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured . 
   this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
   remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago . 
   a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken . 
   this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 
   the dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so . 
   the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
   charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
   what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted . 
   little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 
   ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 
   belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating . 
   one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . 
   chen films the resolutely downbeat smokers only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book . 
   a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad . 
   i spied with my little eye . . . a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
   less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is . 
   blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation . 
   throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
   further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap . 
   any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors . 
   purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too . 
   it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between . 
   two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning . 
   any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
    . . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves . 
   it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances . 
   his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .
