   passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings . 
   looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due . 
   k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich . 
   a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
   an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living . 
   a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée . 
   the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy . 
   a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness . 
   the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
   the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted . 
   if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps . 
   the film is really not so much bad as bland . 
   though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . 
   what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical . 
   the low-budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother . 
   while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
   a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller . 
   based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness . 
   to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending . 
   myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another . 
   the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc . 
   what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 . 
   de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins . 
   fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored . 
   it's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny , and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed . 
   on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there . 
   bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences . 
   reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film . 
   the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago . 
   the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them . 
   schindler's list it ain't . 
   an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding . 
   cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke . 
   a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect . 
   succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series . 
   christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
   like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest . 
    " an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . " 
   john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie . 
   jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter's glory days on three's company . 
   will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr . besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms . shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . 
   the script's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off . 
   if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about . 
   contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
   a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices . 
   there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ? 
   i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho's . 
   it all seemed wasted like deniro's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk . 
   excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic . 
   cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge . 
   grating and tedious . 
   hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 
   i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 
   uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth . 
   the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it doesn't make any sense . 
   kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera . 
   if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation . 
   like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 
   i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay . 
   a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
   sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
   the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo . 
   would that greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility . 
   entertaining enough , but nothing new
   the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness . 
   needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism . 
   directors harry gantz and joe gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves aren't all that interesting . 
   femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
   fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references . 
   no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it . 
   barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference . 
   it's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 
   it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie . 
   some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema . 
   the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield . 
   there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
   if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell . 
   death might be a release . 
   the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story . 
   written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there's something about mary co-writer ed decter . 
   maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back . 
   its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film . 
   no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show . 
   a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
    . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 
   it tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did . 
   a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series . 
   the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
   there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
   despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny . '
   does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny . 
    . . . unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept . 
   wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives ! 
   the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . 
   the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
   scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle . 
   so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 
   there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies . 
   the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive . 
   it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . 
   it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 
   serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst . 
    . . . may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . this scarlet's letter is a . . . as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary . 
   there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more . 
   [l]ame and unnecessary . 
   if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way . 
   the film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . 
   boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
   has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick . 
   like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
   in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
   what a pity . . . that the material is so second-rate . 
   nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . 
   seems like someone going through the motions . 
   for a film about explosions and death and spies , " ballistic : ecks vs . sever " seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies . 
   each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . 
   the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting . 
   stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here… . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
   a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy . 
   for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable . 
   it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons – a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness . 
   it's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction . 
   too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style . 
   distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine . 
   a " home alone " film that is staged like " rosemary's baby , " but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 
   a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . 
   a major waste . . . generic . 
   what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature . 
   phoned-in business as usual . 
   a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie . 
   [crystal and de niro] manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing . 
   aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters . 
   whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche . 
   no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . 
   nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
   a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 
   in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
   if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it . 
   staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce . 
   brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation . 
   a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions . 
   it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 
   the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one . 
   too bad kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up . 
   a dull , dumb and derivative horror film . 
   an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
   like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
   a little objectivity could have gone a long way . 
   adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design . 
   the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut ! 
   what more can be expected from a college comedy that's target audience hasn't graduated from junior high school ? 
   the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal . 
   one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs . sever . 
   halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
   it's not original enough . 
   little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games . 
   it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting . 
   formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip . 
   whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 
   ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . 
   the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 
   frank capra played this story straight . but the 2002 film doesn't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes . 
   the problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up shum's good intentions . 
   what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel . 
   it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 
   crummy
   a loquacious and dreary piece of business . 
   i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
   if routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $8 and get ready for the big shear . this is one baaaaaaaaad movie . 
   a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . 
   starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 
   ' . . . the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well . . . but quite frankly , scoob and shag don't eat enough during the film . '
   more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now . 
   feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class . 
   wishy-washy . 
   rarely has a film's title served such dire warning . 
   if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 
   in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
   director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 
   one thing's for sure—if george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . 
   for dance completists only . 
   a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy . 
   i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
   an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal . 
   shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom . 
   the entire movie is in need of a scented bath . 
   it looks good , but it is essentially empty . 
   the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long . 
   the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character . 
   witless and utterly pointless . 
   when 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 
   'pocas ideas interesantes , un final pseudo místico que no corresponde al tono general del filme y que deja una sensación de inconformidad que hace pensar más de una vez si vale la pena ir a la taquilla y reclamar el precio del boleto . '
   statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british . 
   de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter . 
   in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it . 
   a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor . 
   a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
   does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
   the movie's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichéd and too often strains credulity . 
   a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing . 
   scotland , pa is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept . 
   sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it . 
   the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
   director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10 , 000 times . 
   the fourth in a series that i'll bet most parents had thought --hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished . 
   its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
   it's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good . 
   nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
   the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone . 
   if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . 
   it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie . their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it's just a weird fizzle . 
   cherry orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a 'back story . '
   a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent . 
   you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup . 
   while it's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
   for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets [sci-fi] rehash . 
   a thriller without a lot of thrills . 
   it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . 
   none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with " xxx " is that its own action isn't very effective . 
   perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
   this u-boat doesn't have a captain . 
   a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products . 
   the movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself . 
   it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
   the action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory . 
   never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
   it's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes . . . finally seem so impersonal or even shallow . 
   totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
   whether it's the worst movie of 2002 , i can't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears . but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title . 
   shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull . 
   blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky " pretty woman " retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought . 
   a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis . 
   it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . 
   nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget . 
   if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and cliché . 
   a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie . 
   no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
   the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 
   yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
   even fans of ismail merchant's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one . 
   sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard . 
   it should be doing a lot of things , but doesn't . 
   the movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy . 
   some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck . 
   the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess . 
   eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring . 
   final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
   the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp . 
   well-made but mush-hearted . 
   skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions . 
   manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new . 
   the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 
   the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
   the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . 
   the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
   muddled , trashy and incompetent
   a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .
