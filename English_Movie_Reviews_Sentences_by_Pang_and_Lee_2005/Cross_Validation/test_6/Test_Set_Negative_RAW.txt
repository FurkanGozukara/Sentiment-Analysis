   i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived . 
   though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
   mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination . 
   the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything . 
   takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . 
   even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 
   the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute . 
   some episodes work , some don't . 
   a processed comedy chop suey . 
   as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 
   calculated swill . 
   there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers . 
    . . . ice age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12 . 
   the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch . 
   truly terrible . 
   the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed . 
   what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between . 
   there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
   although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 
   i'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap cliché . 
   sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely . 
   [swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 
   die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with . 
   bad company . bad movie . just plain bad . 
   a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms . 
   this is amusing for about three minutes . 
   they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book . 
   just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls . 
   cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying . 
   it's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere . 
   an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense . 
   this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
   irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free . 
   the one not-so-small problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point . 
   the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus . 
   unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes . 
    . . . unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted . 
   devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special . 
   it's sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat . but the second half of the movie really goes downhill . 
   swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent . 
   suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 . 
   peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight . 
   about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces . . . positively dreadful . 
    . . . while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare's macbeth doesn't sustain a high enough level of invention . 
   clever but not especially compelling . 
   the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher . 
    . . . bibbidy-bobbidi-bland . 
   hugh grant's act is so consuming that sometimes it's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are . 
    . . . hokey art house pretension . 
   it all looks and plays like a $40 million version of a game you're more likely to enjoy on a computer . 
   adults , other than the parents . . . will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild . 
   a direct-to-void release , heading nowhere . 
   a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground . 
   while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it's far from being this generation's animal house . 
   the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin couldn't keep my attention . 
   apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 
   ong chooses to present ah na's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character's blank-faced optimism . 
   just a kiss is a just a waste . 
   it's better than mid-range steven seagal , but not as sharp as jet li on rollerblades . 
   the new film of anton chekhov's the cherry orchard puts the 'ick' in 'classic . '
   with zoe clarke-williams's lackluster thriller " new best friend " , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills . 
   as the movie dragged on , i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . i have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short . 
   the emperor's club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but . . . 
   the plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution . 
   rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories . 
   [a] rather thinly-conceived movie . 
   the film's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling . 
   the movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots . 
   only for young children , if them . their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes . 
   a sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer . 
   hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script . 
   a peculiar misfire that even tunney can't save . 
   each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
   4ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as pokemon videos , but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly . 
   the film wasn't preachy , but it was feminism by the book . 
   the film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe . 
   too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work . 
   heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations . 
   has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that seagal's overweight and out of shape . 
   twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him . big time . 
   if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
   my own minority report is that it stinks . 
   odd and weird . 
   one of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch . 
   schneider's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story's continuity and progression . 
   in the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . 
   mr . goyer's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way . 
   like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy . the film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet . 
   when the fire burns out , we've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that's where the film ultimately fails . 
   a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama . '
   one of those strained caper movies that's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends . 
   it's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before . 
   personal velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces . 
   too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 
   director boris von sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through . 
   never comes together as a coherent whole . 
   the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
   'cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
   it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) . 
   ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing . 
   starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter . 
   a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing . 
   oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . 
   bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
   an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . 
   makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
   the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal . 
   hollywood ending just isn't very funny . 
   i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings . 
   two hours of junk . 
   i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done . 
   don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action . 
   sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they'd need a shower . 
   busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy . 
   well-meaning but inert . 
   [stevens is] so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits . 
    . . . generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish . 
   this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
   amidst the action , the script carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the " other side of the story . " 
   extremely bad . 
   the fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier . 
   the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy . 
   there's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme . 
   suffers from all the excesses of the genre . 
   the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them . 
   essentially a collection of bits -- and they're all naughty . 
   in the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director roger kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of . . . outrageous gags . 
   the real question this movie poses is not 'who ? ' but 'why ? '
   a movie that's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts . 
   bottom-rung new jack city wannabe . 
   slick piece of cross-promotion . 
   taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes . 
   apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other . 
   very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant achilles' heel in " stuart little 2 " : there's just no story , folks . 
   it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary . 
   even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea . 
   there's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clichéd , doddering , misogynistic boy's club . 
   rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign . 
   the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
   there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part sliding doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them . 
   it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie . 
   expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery . 
   it treats women like idiots . 
   the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power . 
   almost gags on its own gore . 
   i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
   the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . 
   simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy . 
   it's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker . 
   a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 
   too slow , too long and too little happens . 
   they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending . 
   it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as 'worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that . 
   without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . 
   for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one . 
   a sequel that's much too big for its britches . 
   a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
   it's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions . 
   rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment . 
   paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma's scarface . that's a cheat . 
   this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against . 
   it's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think . socrates motions for hemlock . 
   [a] shapeless blob of desperate entertainment . 
   a by-the-numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
   a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . 
   [director] o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short . 
   the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . 
   no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise . 
   if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball . 
   intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject . 
   a workshop mentality prevails . 
   director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback . 
   outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . 
   this isn't even madonna's swept away . this is her blue lagoon . 
   sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
   it's everything you don't go to the movies for . 
   like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter . 
    . . . plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments . 
   manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane . 
   samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
   while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
   if you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever . 
   there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff . 
   shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere . 
   the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died . 
   who needs love like this ? 
   returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy . 
   mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
   irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater . 
   every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife . 
   it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
   unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller . 
   under-rehearsed and lifeless
   tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool . 
   the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound . 
   proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie . 
   topkapi this is not . 
   while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy . 
   literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes . 
   the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
   instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? 
   every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv . 
   both awful and appealing . 
   we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting . 
   there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version . 
   birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . 
   that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point . 
   focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her " madness " so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device . 
    . . . the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats . 
   largely a for-fans artifact . 
   first-time director joão pedro rodrigues' unwillingness to define his hero's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on . 
   no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either . 
   watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 
   feels like one of those contrived , only-in -hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk . 
   pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick . 
   nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them . 
    " collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment – until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
    . . . too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film . 
   sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
   'unfaithful' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory . too bad . 
   godawful boring slug of a movie . 
   vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship . 
   offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
   whatever eyre's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place . 
   a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash . 
   mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness . 
   [davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race . 
   the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
   it's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story . 
   can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . 
   undercover brother doesn't go far enough . it's just a silly black genre spoof . 
   not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs . 
   some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one . 
   the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . 
   a less-than-thrilling thriller . 
   everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones . 
   this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation . 
   director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama . 
   borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu . 
   this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
   if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate . 
   theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
   its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing . 
   philip k . dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach . 
   all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto . 
   so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program . 
    . . . silly humbuggery . . . 
   at the bottom rung of the series' entries . 
   just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos . 
   the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
   the best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now . 
   a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
   an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma . 
   its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper . 
   any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes . 
   haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens . 
   there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming . 
   what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead . 
   de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
   so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun . 
   director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle . 
   i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
   mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
   a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad . 
   abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists . 
   there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production . 
   this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
   the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap . 
   when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . 
    . . . has virtually no script at all . . . 
   dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 
   blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy . 
   when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble . 
   succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies . 
   the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion . 
   a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments . 
   it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
   just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
   every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them . 
   this isn't a " friday " worth waiting for . 
   johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to . 
   the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . 
   it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less . 
   just a bloody mess . 
   for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry . 
   however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release . 
    . . . too dull to enjoy . 
   going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
   lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . 
   it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture . 
   my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional . 
   too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century . 
   leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness . 
   chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it's . . . like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror . 
   no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story . 
   usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it . 
   the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
   unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me . i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic . 
   a lousy movie that's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable . 
   what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class . 
   while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun . 
    . . . has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor — but it's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake- of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity . 
   the stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002's first quarter . 
   i hate this movie
   the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing . 
   [janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
   the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman . 
   it's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
   perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime . 
   this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering . instead , it'll only put you to sleep . 
   the film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes . . . drag the movie down . 
   blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 
   the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
   it's all surface psychodramatics . 
   has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes . 
   ozpetek offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves . 
   a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness . 
   it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since . . . well . . . since last week's reign of fire . 
   sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both . 
   there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters . 
   seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore . 
   roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion . 
   like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 
   make like the title and dodge this one . 
   [green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
   will be far more interesting to the soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by julia roberts . . . 
   has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . . 
   a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 
   the good is very , very good . . . the rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful . 
   an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
   nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 
    . . . would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges . 
   the documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc . -- to do the subject matter justice . 
   you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time . 
   o ótimo esforço do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos são explicados . 
   finally coming down off of miramax's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , waking up in reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie . 
   both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time . 
   [taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb . 
   it's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in invincible and overlook its drawbacks . 
   kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested . 
   the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament . 
    . . . while the humor aspects of 'jason x' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks . 
   another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures . 
   the whole thing's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels . 
   if you adored the full monty so resoundingly that you're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained . 
   call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid . 
   even with its $50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture . 
   the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter . 
    . . . expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape . 
   the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere . 
   the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil . 
    . . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine . 
   an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship . 
   schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . . 
   to say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor . 
   on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it . 
    . . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar . 
   the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched . 
   the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
   a listless and desultory affair . 
   any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years . 
   every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy . 
   if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 
   this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
   at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow . 
   it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny . 
   muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner . 
   ararat feels like a book report
   much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché . 
   bland but harmless . 
   it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long . 
   ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout — and meat loaf explodes . 
   the premise of " abandon " holds promise , . . . but its delivery is a complete mess . 
   the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects . 
   the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste . 
   woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them . 
   even if it made its original release date last fall , it would've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness . 
   the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 
   if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it . 
   horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
   a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self… this orgasm [won't be an] exceedingly memorable one for most people . 
   it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
   [seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 
   something must have been lost in the translation . 
    " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes . 
   amid the cliché and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn . 
   there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
    . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
   it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 
   the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling . 
   wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
   choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . '
   it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
   a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . 
   what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
   it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns . 
   i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
   with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral . 
   a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
   a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors . 
   worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 
   the acting is just fine , but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff . 
   releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them . 
   it was a dark and stormy night . . . 
   even with harris's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear's soul-stripping breakdown . 
   imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 
   godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess . . . in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating . 
   overly long and worshipful bio-doc . 
   i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad . 
   everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way . 
   feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake . 
   director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ? 
   so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 
   snipes is both a snore and utter tripe . 
   a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price . 
   it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 
   demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh . 
   things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content . 
   ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing . 
   a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 
   it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling . 
   this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story . 
   you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
   the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
   the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too . 
   no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
   this movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch . 
   earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding . 
   romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
   the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters . 
   so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy . 
   i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back . 
   although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
   well-meaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy . 
   everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel . 
    coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
   rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations . 
   the laughs are as rare as snake foo yung . 
   there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 
   [screenwriter] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation . 
   friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite . 
   elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 
   none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens . 
   doesn't add up to much . 
   problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on . 
   oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single . 
   that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year's worst cinematic tragedies . 
   the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
   shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling . 
   spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
   one of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called 'comedy' and not laugh once . 
   instead of using george and lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george's haplessness and lucy's personality tics . 
   becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . 
   a movie to forget
   for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time . 
   enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . 
   unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and woo's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie's heart . 
   with a " spy kids " sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a " snl " has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? 
   lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago . 
   dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
   [toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material . 
   as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing . 
   despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . . 
   once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . 
   an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
   this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does . 
   a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita . 
   the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it's insanely violent and very graphic . 
   here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better . 
   it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
   it's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn . 
   a pint-sized 'goodfellas' designed to appeal to the younger set , it's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one's interest . 
   there are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film . it's makes a better travelogue than movie . 
   it's a long way from orwell's dark , intelligent warning cry [1984] to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation . 
   most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs . 
   a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
   it's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf . 
   when the precise nature of matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up . 
   tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 
   spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative . 
   attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither . 
   i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again . 
   it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
   the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
   this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio . 
   the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice . 
   hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 
   despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
   'opening up' the play more has partly closed it down . 
   from the choppy editing to the annoying score to 'special effects' by way of replacing objects in a character's hands below the camera line , " besotted " is misbegotten
   been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
   'es en verdad una pena que mandoki esté realizando cintas tan malas desde hace algún tiempo , pues talento tiene , pero quién sabe dónde lo tiene escondido . '
   while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
   exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair . 
   once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional . 
   lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck . 
   the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class . 
   to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it . 
   by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review . 
   the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one . but death to smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end . 
   juliette binoche's sand is vivacious , but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . 
   as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
   the movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications . 
   even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
   what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it's badder than bad . 
   it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 
   while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
   a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . 
   time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool " clockstoppers , " but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . 
   the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . 
   a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 . 
   an extraordinarily silly thriller . 
   gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth . 
   the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . 
   a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . 
   [lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . 
   the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
   i suspect that you'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it . if you go , pack your knitting needles . 
   the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate . 
   the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying . 
   the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary . 
   you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom . 
   a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
   humor in i spy is so anemic . 
   while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier . 
   in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 
   you cannot guess why the cast and crew didn't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed . 
   if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid . 
   doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago . 
   though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . 
   in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian . 
   the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 
   though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .
