   a sentimental mess that never rings true . 
   this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . 
   the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear . 
   the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable . 
   to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . 
    . . . plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director can't seem to get a coherent rhythm going . in fact , it doesn't even seem like she tried . 
   maybe leblanc thought , " hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . "

   journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull . 
   with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low . 
   a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary .

   by-the-numbers yarn . 
   bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie . 
   the film can depress you about life itself . 
   a big fat pain . 
   aan opportunity wasted . 
   this remake of lina wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero . 
   a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda . 
   given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is .

   what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . 
   the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality . 
   it's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it's well worth a rental . 
   the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types . 
   an extremely unpleasant film . 
   ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies . 
   execrable . 
   however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence .

   while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 
   crikey indeed . 
   absurdities and clichés accumulate like lint in a fat man's navel . 
   the next big thing's not-so-big ( and not-so-hot ) directorial debut . 
   yet another iteration of what's become one of the movies' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally " superior " friends , family . . . 
   a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable . 
   …the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material . 
   unfortunately , kapur modernizes a . e . w . mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks " the four feathers " bare . 
   none of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him . 
   although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . 
   a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you're going to alter the bard's ending , you'd better have a good alternative . 
   expanded to 65 minutes for theatrical release , it still feels somewhat unfinished . 
   in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach . 
   typical animé , with cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names . 
   the master of disguise is funny--not " ha ha " funny , " dead circus performer " funny . and for all the wrong reasons besides . 
   a zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks . 
    if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish . 
   a film with a great premise but only a great premise . 
   while kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot . 
   it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction . 
   no dia em que aceitou dirigir esta continuação , harold ramis deve ter saído da cama com o pé esquerdo . e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este filme também . 
   no better or worse than 'truth or consequences , n . m . ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater . 
   pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle . 
   once again , director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours . 
   i never thought i'd say this , but i'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies ! 
   one scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud . 
   jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive . 
   possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio . 
   from beginning to end , this overheated melodrama plays like a student film . 
   the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative . 
   an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years . 
   several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in " unfaithful . " why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me . 
   thin period piece . 
   the heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in [this] meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot . 
   when mr . hundert tells us in his narration that 'this is a story without surprises , ' we nod in agreement .

   dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring . 
   what's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be . 
   an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product . 
   my precious new star wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag . . . 
   a boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- well , i'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop . 
   ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would . 
   impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act . 
   britney spears' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction . 
   yes , i suppose it's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world traveler gave me no reason to care , so i didn't . 
   hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it doesn't . 
   might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people . 
   breen's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting . 
   hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound . 
   a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 
   has its charming quirks and its dull spots . 
   the jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious . 
   the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but . . . it's at least watchable . 
   it's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled 'the loud and the ludicrous' . . . the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated . 
   director roger michell does so many of the little things right that it's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff . 
   schneidermeister . . . makin' a fool of himself . . . losin' his fan base . . . 
   some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent . 
   a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply . 
   sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 
   the doofus-on- the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . 
    . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen . 
   this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage . 
   is it a comedy ? a drama ? a romance ? a cartoon ? 
   eight legged freaks won't join the pantheon of great monster/science fiction flicks that we have come to love . . . 
   this movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment . 
   the very definition of what critics have come to term an " ambitious failure . " 
   the movie doesn't add anything fresh to the myth .

   it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 
   as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on . 
   the whole film has this sneaky feel to it – as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
   bad and baffling from the get-go . 
   a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie . 
   there's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish . 
    . . . a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone . 
   uzumaki's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse . . . 
   starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches . 
   a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale . 
   self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable . 
   the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient . 
   stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed . 
   ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
   for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence . 
   something has been lost in the translation . . . another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise . 
   with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails . 
   by turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy . 
   boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas . 
   the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone . 
   instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story's emotional thrust . 
   the movie doesn't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us . 
   egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose . 
   life or something like it has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities . 
   kung pow is oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that . 
   it's young guns meets goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs . -greaseballs mob action-comedy . 
   this is the first full scale wwii flick from hong kong's john woo . he's not good with people . 
    . . . one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else . 
   too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley's least accessible screed yet . 
   while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires . 
   a horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness . 
   occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring . 
   the predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances . 
   clare peploe's airless movie adaptation could use a little american pie-like irreverence . 
   illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller . 
   the screenplay by james eric , james horton and director peter o'fallon . . . is so pat it makes your teeth hurt . 
   now here's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud . 
   occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story . 
   laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
   a living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange . the fact that it isn't very good is almost beside the point . 
   fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent . 
   lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney's cutoffs . 
   indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie . 
   it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn . 
   less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins . 
   velocity represents everything wrong with ''independent film'' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene . 
   shrewd but pointless . 
   too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped . 
   while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences . 
   not exactly the bees knees
   one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year . 
   the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler . 
   even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller's hand often feels unsure . 
   at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s . at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects . 
   from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 
   manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite . 
   to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
   doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces . . . that raise the bar on stylized screen violence . 
   the film's essentially over by the meet-cute . 
   walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity . 
   although there are several truly jolting scares , there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at . 
   the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish . 
   vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them . 
   generic thriller junk . teens only . 
   stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time . 
   it's not without its pleasures , but i'll stick with the tune . 
   stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros . -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green's half-hearted movie career . 
   my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . 
   pumpkin wants to have it both ways . 
   [w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands . 
   this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast . 
   the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom . 
   the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks . 
   [serry] wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition . it's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one . 
   its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ? 
   a momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year . 
   a sometimes tedious film . 
   what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting . 
   american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an indian-american would recognize . and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new . 
   instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone . 
   a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [besson's] earlier work . 
   this time mr . burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again . 
   perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie . 
   it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment . 
   not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid . 
   the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . 
   however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust . 
   the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
   demands too much of most viewers . 
   for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor . 
   ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it's all over his chelsea walls . 
   equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama . 
   audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 
   this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through . 
   expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies . 
   [t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context . 
   the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller . 
   the story really has no place to go since simone is not real—she can't provide any conflict . 
   this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie . 
   the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately . 
   human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
   earnest falls short of its ideal predecessor largely due to parker's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material . 
   acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes " never again " worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice
   lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose . 
   somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional . 
   is " ballistic " worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer . 
   imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring . 
    . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work . 
   a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title . 
   a dreadful live-action movie . 
   faultlessly professional but finally slight . 
   there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter . 
   credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment . 
   bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
   what would jesus do if he was a film director ? he'd create a movie better than this . 
   it's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original . 
   there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant . 
   oh , it's extreme , all right . extremely dumb . extremely confusing . extremely boring . 
   one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in . 
   as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound . 
   trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere . 
   all that ( powerpuff girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it's spread too thin . 
   not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny . 
   bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that . 
   a real clunker . a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless . 
   a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality . 
   as written by michael berg and michael j . wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all . 
   adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse . 
   there's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about . 
   too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless . 
   if this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook . 
   imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno . 
   it doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the russos' next offering . 
   often silly – and gross – but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films . 
   if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
   eh . 
   no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . 
   it's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell . 
   denzel washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony . 
   message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
   cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them . 
   well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons . 
   enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment . 
   the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
   sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary . 
   a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale . . . a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more . 
   the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off . 
    in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction . 
   after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna . 
   a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years . 
   ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
   jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips . 
   what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . 
   as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame . 
   splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings . 
   will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly . 
   most of the action setups are incoherent . 
   a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . 
   formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . 
   the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other . 
   maybe it's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this . 
   the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted . 
   if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . 
   uneasy mishmash of styles and genres . 
   herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance . 
   the film's center will not hold . 
   too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise . 
   a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales . 
   the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
   a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense . 
   [u]nrelentingly stupid . 
   the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
   the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll . 
   afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen's men is finally just one long drag . 
   painfully padded . 
   passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless . 
   mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid . 
   murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous . 
   a mild , reluctant , thumbs down .

   really dumb but occasionally really funny . 
   the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial .

   feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum . 
   all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness . 
    . . . post-september 11 , " the sum of all fears " seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
   the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess . 
   humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
   more tiring than anything . 
   less than fresh . 
   a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants . 
   this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless . 
   ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous . 
   rosenthal ( halloween ii ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense . 
   depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 
   deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .

   this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states . 
   the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other . 
   a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . 
   every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here . 
   demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack . 
   it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
   [gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience . 
   short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight… tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . 
   collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly . 
   we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . 
   [creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . 
   an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' . 
   a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun . 
   they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 
   the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy . 
   the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
   yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling . 
   an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility . 
   the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
   except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 
   [jackson and bledel] seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd . 
   like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
   not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . 
   everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . 
   how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ? 
   the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
   a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics . 
   seriously , rent the disney version . 
   dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery . 
   those unfamiliar with mormon traditions may find the singles ward occasionally bewildering . 
   its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 
   this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . 
   unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
   makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
   a bad movie that happened to good actors . 
   the film didn't convince me that calvin jr . 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago's south side . 
   i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . 
   maid in manhattan proves that it's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies . 
   two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending . 
   i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 
   a complete waste of time . 
   it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 
   a guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it . 
   even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 
   check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock . 
    . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
   [tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . 
   there's an admirable rigor to jimmy's relentless anger , and to the script's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there's no place for this story to go but down . 
   this is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least . 
   this is the first film i've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved . 
   presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable . 
   you . . . get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone . 
   memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual . 
   the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell . 
   like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior . . . circuit gets drawn into the party . 
   starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 
   there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . 
   earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock . 
   a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 
   ultimately , jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with . 
   if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is [cattaneo] sophomore slump . 
   replacing john carpenter's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage . of all the halloween's , this is the most visually unappealing . 
   return to never land is much more p . c . than the original version ( no more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) , but the excitement is missing . 
   though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director achero manas's film is schematic and obvious . 
    " not really as bad as you might think ! " 
   an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
   comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man . 
   in a 102-minute film , aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the " queen " and less of the " damned . " 
   it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
   a mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it's the butt of its own joke . 
   director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the " miami vice " checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . 
   a relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale . 
   the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned . 
   disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies…or any other john woo flick for that matter . 
   the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events . 
   has not so much been written as assembled , frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups . 
   it's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah . 
   lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling . 
   the film's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting . 
   the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 
   nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here . 
   the armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment . 
   not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
   this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 . 
   the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
   it appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up . 
   like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . 
   whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it's an unhappy situation all around . 
   a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade . 
   as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . 
   it's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one . 
   far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love . 
   harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden . 
   soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence . 
   rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf's encounter with the world . 
   the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters . 
   an " o bruin , where art thou ? " -style cross-country adventure . . . it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack . 
   an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message . 
   no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way . 
   staggeringly dreadful romance . 
   this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things . 
   it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . 
   the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs . 
   though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected . 
   the campy results make mel brooks' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated . 
   its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists . 
   hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing . 
   feels strangely hollow at its emotional core . 
   this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
   it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will . 
   as pedestrian as they come . 
   for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league .
